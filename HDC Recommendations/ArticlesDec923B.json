        "text":["<p>The nature of an administration – in terms of both policy and service to the citizenry – depends on the ethics and intellectualism of ministers, the knowledge of senior administrative staff, and the level of cooperation between them. Elected officials hold the decision-making power, but in their efforts to realize their ideology, knowledge must be given great weight. </p> \n<p>Israel is an outstanding high-tech country, but this is not reflected in the corridors of its administration. Many MKs, and a good number of ministers, lack the knowledge required to optimally perform their roles. The education level of senior administrative staff does not meet the necessary minimum of a masters degree or equivalent plus a large number of people with doctoral degrees.</p> \n<p>And now in addition comes the prime ministers and defense ministers desire to be allowed – in the spirit of the hilltop youth – to make numerous political appointments to senior administration positions, without these appointees having to be found through a search committee and meeting appropriate basic requirements. They say this will allow them to govern more effectively.</p> \n<p>However, if a minister thinks that the civil servants in his ministry are sabotaging his policy (a complaint I have rarely heard in many years of close acquaintance with the civil service), he should activate an accelerated judicial proceeding against them in order to dismiss them. A ministers authority could also be expanded to appoint professional advisors, as long as these appointees meet strict qualification requirements. This could help prevent a situation in which a minister feels isolated in his ministry due to his worldview.</p> \n<p>A minister could also be enabled to choose, for example, one of three candidates for a deputy director general position, once all have met strict requirements concerning knowledge and experience and have been legally selected via a tender. </p> \n<p>But it is unacceptable to increase the number of close associates in positions of this kinds. A minister who insists that otherwise he cannot exercise his democratic right to govern is flawed in one of two ways: Hes either aiming to garner more party support through a division of spoils, or lacks the capacity to govern. In either case, he is not worthy of serving in his position.</p> \n<p>The prime minister cites the United States as an example in his call for greater leeway to appoint his close associates. Indeed, there is something we can learn from the U.S.: For example, in relation to the status to be given the National Security Council, or the frequent transitions between academia and senior administration positions. Instituting a presidential system in Israel – through learning from the experience of the U.S. and other countries – would also be worthwhile.</p> \n<p>But simplistic citation on the system of public administration in the U.S. is born of ignorance. It ignores the fact that the interface between citizens and the services of the administration is largely created on the state and not the federal level, and that nearly all the senior politicians are university-educated. After the old division-of-spoils system failed there, they are careful at both the federal level and often on the state level to maintain a level of professionalism in political appointments. </p> \n<p>Actually, a civil service model more worth emulating is to be found in Singapore. In America, in some states senior judges are elected in general elections, or their continued tenure is periodically put to a public referendum. Do we really want to copy such an inane idea?</p> \n<p>Forgoing search committees for senior appointments and allowing political appointments instead would further harm the quality of decision-making and civil service. Overpoliticization of the civil service should be forcefully opposed, regardless of political affiliations.</p> \n<p>Due to the importance of the subject, of which the public and politicians are not sufficiently aware, I feel it is my duty, this being my field of expertise, to at this time leave aside clinical, academic language and publicly address the prime minister: I call upon him to retract his proposal to increase the number of political appointments, prevent partisan efforts in various ministries to increase politicization at the expense of professional knowledge, and rein in those ministers who speak scornfully of the need for decision-making to be based on a high level of professional knowledge. All of this, combined with concerted action to raise the level of professionalism among senior administrative personnel, is the real urgent reform that is needed in the civil administration. Not overpoliticization.</p>",

        "text":["<p>India has officially pulled out of a half-billion dollar anti-tank missile deal with the Israeli company Rafael in favor of encouraging its local defense industry, Rafael told Haaretz on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, India agreed to another deal to buy missiles from the same company in a roughly $70 million deal, according to the Hindustan Times.</p> \n<p>In November Rafael Advanced Defense Systems denied to Haaretz that its deal to manufacture Spike anti-tank missiles in Hyderabad, in collaboration with the local company Kalyani Strategic Systems, was off. The company said it had already begun to transfer development information.&nbsp;Indian media reported however that the deal had not been finalized and that the Ministry of Defense decided to develop anti-tank missiles at home, to encourage the local defense industry.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, however, Rafael confirmed to the Kan website and to Haaretz that the deal was off. &quot;Rafael received formal notice from the Indian Ministry of Defense that the deal for Spike missiles is canceled,&quot; the company stated, adding that the Spike is used by 26 countries, and that it had been awarded the deal after protracted negotiation and meeting all India's requirements.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rafael admitted that no final deal had been signed: &quot;The cancelation was before the contract was signed, despite the company meeting all the requirements,&quot; it stated on Tuesday. &quot;Rafael regrets the decision but is committed to continuing to pursue this important goal, as it has been doing with great success for over two decades, with a range of innovative, advanced systems and with commitment to the Indian Ministry of Defense. The company will continue to cooperate, including in the framework of the prime minister's delegation to India [later] this month,&quot; the company stated.</p> \n<p>Rafael CEO Yoav Har Even will be joining other Israeli defense industry leaders on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's trip to India, now scheduled for January 14 to 18.</p> \n<p>Despite terminating the deal to co-manufacture Spike missiles with Rafael, the Indian government smiled upon a deal to buy Barak missiles from Rafael for the Indian navy, the Hindustan Times reported on Tuesday. The Barak missiles, which will set India back 460 crore or about $76 million, are surface to air missiles designed to be used as a ship-borne anti-missile defense system against anti-ship missiles, the ministry explained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>India also agreed to procure 240 precision guided bombs for the Indian Air Force from Russia, according to the Hindustan Times.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Naty Saidoff announced last week he was buying control of Housing &amp; Construction for 1 billion shekels ($276.2 million), he made clear it wouldn’t be his last deal.</p> \n<p>Housing &amp; Construction is “the first in a series of acquisitions Saidoff Group plans,” he said. In fact, it was Saidoff’s third stab at buying an Israeli asset, after abortive bids for Jerusalem Economic Corporation, Africa Israel Investments and Eurocom Communications.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel's 30 richest in 2018</p> \n<p>Until he emerged on the Israeli scene less than two years ago, Saidoff was an unknown – an Israeli who left for Los Angeles decades ago and made his fortune in property. That makes him similar to Moti Ben-Moshe, a former Israeli who made money in Germany in energy.</p> \n<p>There’s also Argentina property magnate Eduardo Elsztain, who parachuted into Israel by buying control of IDB group in 2013, and brothers Chen and Tzahi Neuman, whose business interests are in Israel.</p> \n<p>They are the impending new generation of tycoons, who are building empires in many cases on the ruins of the previous generation of tycoons – Nochi Dankner, Eliezer Fishman, Lev Leviev and Shaul Elovitch – who were brought down by a combination of debt and in some cases legal entanglements.</p> \n<p>Saidoff first pursued JEC in September 2016, which was then controlled by an indebted Fishman, with an offer to buy 30% of the property company for 540 million shekels. That was a 20% discount to JEC’s already depressed share price, and shareholders rejected it.</p> \n<p>Saidoff then fought with fellow tycoon-on-the-make Ben-Moshe for control of Lev Leviev’s Africa Israel, which is saddled with 3 billion shekels in debt to bondholders. In the end Ben-Moshe prevailed with a bailout offer worth 80 million shekels more.</p> \n<p>Saidoff didn’t give up and in February bid up to 875 million for four subsidiaries of Elovitch’s Eurocom Communications, whose prize asset is Israel’s biggest telecommunications provider, Bezeq.</p> \n<p>A month later Saidoff backed out, telling the court administering the group that governance changes at Bezeq would effectively prevent whoever owned Eurocom from controlling Bezeq.</p> \n<p>Saidoff returned with a better offer for Eurocom, but he now faces competition: Internet Gold, a tier in the Eurocom pyramid, said this week that the Neumans were interested in buying most of its holding in B Communications — one notch below in the pyramid — for 730 million shekels. That would give them control of Bezeq.</p> \n<p>In 2013, as Dankner sought to keep control of IDB, the Neumans led a group offering 900 million shekels for control of IDB Development.</p> \n<p>The deal fell through, but two years later they were back with an offer of up to 300 million shekels for the filling station company Ten, owned by Fishman. They lost that bid to a private equity fund, but last year they again tried unsuccessfully to buy the energy company Sonol.</p> \n<p>Of the emerging tycoons, Ben-Moshe has the best track record for deals completed.

        "text":["<p>Tomatoes and eggs: so simple, so tasty. What’s the secret charm of shakshuka, one of the Israel’s most popular dishes and one of the few that can be enjoyed morning, afternoon and evening? Maybe it’s the simplicity and ease of preparation, or the comforting warmth and unsophisticated sauce. It may be the pleasure of soaking up the sauce with bread or pita. Or perhaps the explanation is simpler: The combination of eggs and tomatoes is just a delight to the palate.</p> \n<p>Shakshuka came to us from North Africa (both Tunisians and Tripolitanians claim credit), but the person who put it on the local culinary map was Jaffa’s famous Dr. Shakshuka.</p> \n<p>Since then our culinary scene has undergone numerous changes, and today’s shakshuka is not what it used to be. Now you can find it in gourmet cafes as well as workers’ restaurants, and it comes in a variety of versions, with multiple additions, including spinach, cheese, frankfurters, meat and just about anything else.</p> \n<p>We embarked on a tour of Tel Aviv to find selected examples of the numerous genres, and examined the differences in sauces, the sliced tomatoes, the spices, the bread, and of course the tasty additions. Here are nine versions that hit the spot.</p> \n<p>Upscale morning: Caf&eacute; 65</p> \n<p>The breakfast here may not be suitable daily, but it definitely provides the feeling of a quick trip abroad or at least the weekend for two you haven’t yet managed to arrange. There’s a regular morning deal: You choose a main dish from the menu, and then can be dazzled by the high-quality, varied buffet. One of the main offerings is a green shakshuka with spinach and mangold, accompanied by goat yogurt and sour cream that seem to imply “I deserve it, I’m on vacation today.”</p> \n<p>If we’re looking for a kick of tartness and spicy seasoning in the tomatoes, here the experience is completely different: The dish is buttery, soft and rich, almost like creamed spinach combined with cr&egrave;me patissiere. Choose some of the tempting breads and enjoy wiping up very soft and creamy eggs.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: The amazing buffet includes fresh salads, smoked fish, cheeses, spreads, fresh juices, sweet and savory pastries, healthy breads and more.</p> \n<p>Price: 105 shekels ($30) per diner, including a choice of beverages.</p> \n<p>Caf&eacute; 65, Rothschild 65, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Pampering: Matriciana at Benedict</p> \n<p>As befits a breakfast empire, Benedict offers a limited and on-target section of eggs with seasoned, sizzling tomatoes. We decided to focus on a portion of the shakshuka matriciana, which combines regular and cherry tomatoes, a generous amount of crispy bacon, eggs prepared any style, and gouda cheese with touches of Parmesan. If the description doesn’t make your stomach start to growl, trust the aroma to do so.</p> \n<p>This is a surprising and enjoyable dish, which all the surrounding treats turn into a real meal. Benedict had the sense not to pile on dominant spices, but allow the smoked bacon and gouda upgrade the entire concept – and your expectations. In short: We recommend eating when your next destination includes sprawling on the sofa.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: We hope for your sake that you didn’t come here to count calories. The famous basket of breads, accompanied by soft butter, jam and Nutella, come with your order, together with home-made pesto, dips and a refreshing green salad.</p> \n<p>Price: 69 shekels, including a choice of beverages.</p> \n<p>Benedict, Rothschild 29, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>In transit: Tunisian Sandwich Center</p> \n<p>The world is divided into those who think shakshuka always belongs in a skillet, and those who like it in a sandwich. We’re willing to accept any tasty version, regardless of religion, race, gender or carbohydrate. In the Tunisian Sandwich Center in south Tel Aviv they don’t waste the customers’ time, and offer a large number of quick and satisfying baguettes, including ordinary shashuka or shakshuka with merguez sausage.</p> \n<p>Although the eggs are prepared in advance, there is a quick, efficient turnover of diners, so they maintain their juicy tenderness, with no burnt flavors. The end result is a simple, homey sandwich, without superfluous liquids, combined with a touch of pickled lemon and a spicy readymade salad – everything you need when you’re hungry at lunchtime.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: Whether you eat it there or take your food back to the office or your car, you’ll get a small bag of green and black olives and mischievous shipka pepper.</p> \n<p>Price: 18 shekels in a white baguette, 19 in a whole wheat baguette.</p> \n<p>Tunisian Sandwich Center, Hapatish, corner of Shocken 9, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>The spicy one: Mergeuz at Shakshukia</p> \n<p>Eight different types of shakshuka, a warm, simple design and Oriental music that blends with the aromas – the Shakshukia on Ben Yehuda Street is probably the best place to go to if you feel like playing it safe. Not only is there a variety of additions (chickpeas, eggplant and parsley, goose breast and more), but here you can choose the degree of spiciness you prefer on a scale of 1 to 5, and have your eggs soft, medium or hard-boiled.</p> \n<p>We decided this time on a spicy shakshuka with good merguez frankfurters and medium-cooked eggs, which arrived perfectly done, just as shakshuka should be. We think the secret is a profound and uncompromising spiciness that isn’t scalding or unpleasant. The relatively large pieces of sausage come with fresh tomatoes, lots of peppers and onions in small cubes that don’t dominate the texture.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: Old-fashioned black bread, tahini, and if you smile a little you may get a chaser. Who knows?</p> \n<p>Price: 49 shekels (a classic shakshuka, 37 shekels)</p> \n<p>Shakshukia, Ben Yehuda 94, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Vegan and surprising: Anastasia</p> \n<p>The vegan caf&eacute; on Frishman Street has made a name for itself, and rightly so. At Anastasia they treat every ingredient and dish seriously, far from the sloppy image often identified with places of this genre. The menu is broad, rich and interesting, doesn’t include many items disguised as something else (anyone for bread steak?). There are lots of salads, healthy grains, sandwiches and morning options – under which you’ll find a slow-cooked tomato shakshuka with garlic, spinach, polenta balls and tofu, which proves you don’t need eggs to feel satisfied. The seasoning is moderate, the spinach enriches the base, and the somewhat coarsely cut vegetables add some more interest.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: Tahini, smoked eggplant cream and cashew labaneh, and you can even ask for gluten-free bread.</p> \n<p>Price: 54 shekels (we’d be happy if that included a beverage in the early part of the day).</p> \n<p>Anastasia, Frishman 54, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>The pretentious one: white shakshuka at Mashya</p> \n<p>Yossi Chetrit’s fine restaurant does things in a big way in the morning, too. You’ll find a colorful, high-class buffet and a menu of main courses based on eggs in many shapes and forms, including vegetable frittata with hubeiza (mallow), eggs Benedict in a croissant and of course the object of our mission. You can go for red shakshuka with paprika and coriander, but if you’re getting it directly from the chef, try the white dish concocted on a base of cream, spinach, mushrooms, parsley, two eggs and a touch of truffle. To make the whole story a little more sinful, the dish will come with a sweet challah from the taboun.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: an abundant Mashya-style buffet: salads, spreads, pastries, smoked fish, sausages, granola, fruit, baked goods from the taboun, muffins, cakes and cocktails for an additional charge. Brunch is served every weekday from 10 to 11 A.M. (you can sit until 12:30), and on Friday from 11:00 A.M. to 2:30 P.M.</p> \n<p>Price: 88-98 shekels, depending on the main course.</p> \n<p>Mashya, Mendele Mocher Sfarim 5, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Atmospheric: Shukshuka in the Carmel Market</p> \n<p>The small place in Kerem Hateimanim opened in 2015, when it offered almost 10 different types of shakshuka. Since then the open stall has adjusted to the area and naturally made changes in the menu as well. Today you’ll find mainly dishes that correspond to the energies of the market and encourage another drink in the middle of the day: small fried fish, souvlaki, light salads and a small and exclusive category of shakshukas.</p> \n<p>The home-made recipe here may not knock you off your feet, but when you’re looking for light Israeli comfort at the outskirts of the bustling market, this is definitely a good option. Anyone who has trouble with coarse pieces of hot tomato will find the portion particularly user friendly, with a uniform texture that’s not too heavy and a pleasant spiciness of fried green pepper. And of course a bit of liberated market atmosphere and a charming staff that will serve you with love.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: Suri olives, tahini, spicy torshi (pickled vegetables) and simple and tasty white bread from the nearby bakery.</p> \n<p>Price: 38 shekels.</p> \n<p>Shukshuka Simtat Hacarmel 30, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Shakshuka in a bread bowl: Bread Story</p> \n<p>What do they do in a place that specializes in bread and also serves shakshuka? Just what you think. The caf&eacute; on Dizengoff Street makes sure to maintain a standard, light menu that caters to everyone. Although the first impression feels like something of a gimmick, the relatively classic recipe manages to surprise, and the way they serve the food turns out to be convenient and smart. The bowl of fresh bread does a good job of holding the cooked dish, absorbs the liquids as necessary and stays crisp even when you get to the bottom. The use of cumin here is relatively prominent, there’s lots of onion cut into bite-sized strips, but a prominent presence of gamba may not please everyone.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: There’s already bread here, of course. Along with it you’ll get a small saucer of tahini, a pickled lemon (not home-made but serviceable), and a chopped vegetable salad.</p> \n<p>Price: 56 shekels.</p> \n<p>Bread Story, Dizengoff 88, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Old school: shakshuka with Bulgarian cheese at Caspi</p> \n<p>In a place where you “wipe” hummus, nosh felafel and have malabi (a milk-based pudding perfumed with rosewater) for dessert, there should also be a decent-sized and safe portion of good old Israeli shakshuka. Chef Yaniv Caspi isn’t concealing state secrets or unusual ingredients, but that’s probably additional proof that good shakshuka is sometimes only a matter of the dosage and a steady and confident hand. The base, except for fresh (and peeled!) tomatoes, begins over a flame with olive oil, generous slices of garlic, sweet paprika, spicy pepper and a touch of cumin (and note that this time the onion is omitted). When it’s served they add a few cubes of Bulgarian cheese and a handful of chopped fresh parsley. The result is a comforting Mediterranean skillet that is both heartwarming and appetizing.</p> \n<p>Additional treats: Pickled vegetables and pitas.</p> \n<p>Price: 35 shekels for the classic, 37 for a version with Bulgarian cheese/eggplant/chick peas.</p> \n<p>Caspi, Kikar Masarik 1, Tel Aviv</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here</p> \n<p>REMEMBERING -- Charles Krauthammer, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and intellectual provocateur, dies at 68 -- by&nbsp;Adam Bernstein:&nbsp;&quot;Charles Krauthammer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post columnist and intellectual provocateur who championed the muscular foreign policy of neoconservatism... died June 21 at 68... Known for acerbic, unsparing prose and hawkishness on U.S. and Israeli security matters, Dr. Krauthammer long directed his moral indignation at the “liberal monopoly” on the news cycle...&nbsp;On Israeli-Palestinian relations, he acknowledged the suffering on both sides but firmly defended the Jewish state in what he saw as its existential battle for survival.&quot;  &quot;Dr. Krauthammer said his politics were shaped by growing up in the post-Holocaust years with Jewish parents who had escaped the Nazis in Europe. He grew up attuned to the “tragic element in history,” he once told a C-SPAN interviewer. “It tempers your optimism and your idealism... You don’t expect that much out of human nature. And you are prepared for the worst.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  &quot;Mr. Krauthammer was born on March 13, 1950, in Manhattan to Orthodox Jewish immigrants. His father, Shulim, a lawyer who spoke nine languages, came to New York from Ukraine through France and Cuba, where he met Thea Horowitz, who would become his wife. She had left Belgium the day the Germans invaded, May 10, 1940, and later translated American military manuals for the Free French army.&quot; [NYT]  Things that matter, in the words of Charles Krauthammer -- “Everyone’s Jewish,”&nbsp;Sept. 25, 2006 --&nbsp;&quot;Apart from its political irrelevance, it seems improbable in the extreme that the cowboy-boots-wearing football scion of Southern manner and speech [former Virginia governor George Allen] should turn out to be, at least by origins, a son of Israel. For Allen, as he quipped to me, it’s the explanation for a lifelong affinity for Hebrew National hot dogs. For me, it is the ultimate confirmation of something I have been regaling friends with for 20 years and now, for the advancement of social science, feel compelled to publish.&quot;&nbsp;  “Do we really mean ‘never again’?”&nbsp;Jan. 30, 2015 --&nbsp;&quot;On the 70th anniversary of Auschwitz, mourning dead Jews is easy. And, forgive me, cheap.&nbsp;Want to truly honor the dead? Show solidarity with the living — Israel and its 6 million Jews.&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;  George Will writes... &quot;Charles Krauthammer’s death leaves a huge void:&nbsp;Dictating columns when not driving himself around Washington in a specially designed van that he operated while seated in his motorized wheelchair, crisscrossing the country to deliver speeches to enthralled audiences, Charles drew on reserves of energy and willpower to overcome a multitude of daily challenges, any one of which would cause most people to curl up in a fetal position... Some people are such a large presence while living that they still occupy space even when they are gone.&quot; [NYPost]&nbsp;  UPDATE -- Morton Klein emails us this morning...&nbsp;&quot;ZOA learned from a FARA filing (Foreign Agents Registration Act) report this week&nbsp;that a donation from a wealthy businessman&nbsp;to buy two tables at the ZOA Gala Dinner last year&nbsp;may very well be linked to Qatar funds he received. Even though this gift was perfectly legal, and&nbsp;since ZOA would never knowingly accept funds from Qatar, ZOA has returned the entire $100,000&nbsp;to the donor.&nbsp;It should be understood that ZOA received the money purely as a donation to support our pro-Israel work on campuses, on Capitol Hill, in the courts, in the media and in Israel. There was never a hint of a quid pro quo or conditions placed with this donation. Neither ZOA or Morton Klein ever praised or lobbied for Qatar and, in fact, have&nbsp;strongly and publicly criticized Qatar’s actions and policies.&quot;&nbsp;  ULTIMATE DEAL WATCH -- Israeli&nbsp;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Jared Kushner and Mideast peace envoy Jason Greenblatt in Jerusalem this morning on the final leg of their Middle East tour.&nbsp;  White House readout: &quot;Senior Advisor Jared Kushner and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt returned to Israel and met today with Ambassador David Friedman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They discussed the means by which the humanitarian situation in Gaza can be alleviated, while maintaining Israel’s security. They further discussed the continued commitment of the Trump Administration and Israel to advance peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.&quot;  The Prime Minister’s Office in a statement: “Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his gratitude for President Trump's support for Israel. The teams discussed advancing the diplomatic process, developments in the region and the security and humanitarian situations in Gaza.”  U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman&nbsp;called it a &quot;great meeting&quot; and shared a photo of the group of five in Jerusalem. [Pic]  Trump's Palestinian aid-for-peace moves face tough challenges -- by David Wainer and Margaret Talev:&nbsp;&quot;The Trump administration's Middle East negotiators... will be discussing ways to avert a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and create jobs in the West Bank while in the region this week, said two Israeli officials...&nbsp;The U.S. believes a stronger Palestinian economy could bolster peace prospects, a White House official said...&nbsp;&quot;I have no doubt the administration would like to be able to show that it's affecting matters on the ground, because that would create a more favorable context&quot; for presenting the peace plan, said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat who was involved in efforts to resolve the conflict. Still, &quot;that doesn't mean that you get the Palestinians immediately back to the negotiating table,&quot; he said.&quot; [Bloomberg]&nbsp;  --&nbsp;&quot;Jordanian King Abdullah II said Thursday that there will not be peace in the Middle East without establishing a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.&quot; [Reuters]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jordan king heads to US for Trump meeting:&nbsp;&quot;Jordan’s King Abdullah II set off for the United States on Thursday for talks with US President Donald Trump on Middle East issues including the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the palace said. Accompanied by his wife Rania, the monarch is also scheduled to meet with senior officials from the Trump administration and members of Congress...&nbsp;His meeting with Trump is expected to take place at the White House on Monday.&quot;&nbsp;[YahooNews]  Aaron David Miller, a&nbsp;Middle East analyst at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, tells us...&nbsp;&quot;I think this is the 'check the box' trip. If Trump wants to present a peace plan then they have to go through the motions and the reality of coming up with a plan. But the U.S. cannot assume that it can shower&nbsp;Israel with&nbsp;honey so that it would be&nbsp;impossible for Netanyahu to say no. You can't buy Bibi no matter what you give him. If you are going to ask him to do hard things then you are going to end up having to fight him, and I don't think they want to fight him.&quot;  &quot;There will be things in this plan Bibi won't like, but in my judgment, it will allow Bibi to say to the President that after several considerations, 'I have reservations, but I give you a yes, but.' But I don't think they will have enough for the Arabs to make sure that MBS stands up and endorses the plan full stop. The Palestinians will almost certainly say no.&quot;  &quot;With some course correction, if they wanted to, the administration could create a credible basis for negotiations. I just don't think that given where the President stands on Israel, given the headaches&nbsp;that will arise with Evangelicals if they touch the Jerusalem issue in a way that would satisfy the Palestinians, I think you are going to end up with a fight. And since Trump has come to a conclusion that the real glory is North Korea, it would be worth fighting with the Israelis under only one set of circumstances, and that is if Trump could actually get a deal. But there are so many things wrong with this approach, and there are so many moving parts that I can't believe that Greenblatt, Kushner and Trump believe that this could create a basis for negotiations.&quot;&nbsp;  Tamara Cofman Wittes&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Israelis I’ve spoken to seem to think there might be a real peace plan or at least some language hard for Bibi to accept, for example on Palestinian statehood. I’m not so sure. I imagine that what Greenblatt/Kushner are hearing from leaders in Israel and the Gulf is mostly about Gaza... Gaza is what creates political and PR problems for Gulf leaders, not the fate of the West Bank... Gaza is the subject of the only serious international meeting Greenblatt has convened in DC so far. And I bet he thinks Gaza can be the platform for a new US new peace initiative...&quot;  &quot;My prediction: if/when The plan is finally released, it will be “Gaza first.” It will mobilize international including Gulf aid to improve Gaza Palestinians’ lives with projects while seeking to undermine/displace Hamas rule there...&nbsp;It will seek to use success in Gaza to raise hopes and lay groundwork for the&nbsp;resumption of negotiations on final status. It might suggest others join those negotiations in place of previous bilats. But it might not specify when negotiations might resume, on what basis, or to what end.&quot;&nbsp;  ROYAL VISIT -- British milestones in Holy Land set traditional foundation for royal visit -- by Maayan Lubell:&nbsp;“Prince William will become on Monday the first British royal to pay an official visit to Israel and the Palestinian Territories, 70 years after British forces withdrew from the Holy Land leaving behind the divisions that remain to this day... He will stay in Jerusalem at the King David hotel, once the headquarters of British authorities William will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. He will also visit religious sites, Israel’s Yad Vashem memorial to the Holocaust dead, and the tomb of his great-grandmother Princess Alice.” [Reuters]&nbsp;  UK defends calling Jerusalem Old City part of ‘Occupied Palestinian Territories’ -- by&nbsp;Raphael Ahren:&nbsp;&quot;The British ambassador to Israel on Thursday defended describing Jerusalem’s Old City as being part of the “Occupied Palestinian Territories” in the itinerary for Prince William’s upcoming visit to Israel and the West Bank. “All the terminology that was used in the program was consistent with years of practice by British governments. It’s consistent with British government policy,” David Quarrey said...&nbsp;“It’s the first official visit by a senior member of the royal family. I think it’s going to be a great success,” the ambassador said.&quot; [ToI]&nbsp;  ON THE GROUND --&nbsp;Iran, Hezbollah Pull Back From Israeli Border At Russia's Request, Syrian Watchdog Group Says -- by&nbsp;Jason Lemon:&nbsp;&quot;Iran, Hezbollah and other Tehran-backed militias in Syria have begun withdrawing from the disputed Golan Heights border with Israel, a watchdog group announced&nbsp;Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said that the militants were&nbsp;headed&nbsp;40 kilometers (25 miles) away from the border, in response to Russian demands following previously reported negotiations between Moscow and Israel.&quot; [Newsweek]  Amos Harel&nbsp;writes...&nbsp;&quot;In recent weeks, it seems the Pompeo document is beginning to take effect. It is not just the apparent avalanche of American companies, and to a lesser extent European firms, that are abandoning planned deals with Tehran. The Iranians are beginning to feel the pressure in other places too, along the entire Shi’ite Crescent – the front on which they leveraged their influence in recent years, from Lebanon and Syria in the north to Bahrain in the east and Yemen in the south.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY&nbsp;ON NPR'S FRESH AIR -- Emily Jane Fox, author of the new book Born Trump,&nbsp;on reports&nbsp;that&nbsp;Ivanka Trump helped convince her father to&nbsp;sign&nbsp;an executive order to end the separation of families at the U.S. border: &quot;Knowing what I know, having reported on Ivanka Trump for&nbsp;Vanity Fair&nbsp;for almost three years now ... it's hard to make that justification that she would be the person who has that much influence, only because we have seen time and time again stories leaked to the press about [how] Ivanka expressed her concern over the&nbsp;travel ban, Ivanka expressed her concern behind the scenes over the&nbsp;Paris Climate Accord. And in those instances, her private advocacy made no difference... I think it would be significantly overstating her influence to say that the president changed his mind on Wednesday because of what Ivanka Trump showed him on Tuesday.&quot; [NPR]&nbsp;  The West Wing Is Fracturing Over Trump’s Callous Migrant-Family Policy -- by&nbsp;Gabriel Sherman:&nbsp;&quot;There are echoes of Charlottesville, with the president digging himself deeper, even as the midterms loom. “This is brutal,” said one Republican close to the president. “Trump is riding high in the polls, and it’s playing into his mental state that he’s invincible.” ... “Stephen actually enjoys seeing those pictures at the border,” an outside White House adviser said. “He’s a twisted guy, the way he was raised and picked on. There’s always been a way he’s gone about this. He’s Waffen-SS.”&quot; [VanityFair]&nbsp;  White House aide Miller targeted in backlash over family separations -- by Nancy Cook:&nbsp;&quot;Among White House insiders, there is a sense that the president’s senior adviser for policy is a bad front man for the issue he’s most passionate about. Miller stayed entirely out of the spotlight during days of mounting political pressure...&nbsp;“He led the president down a path that again ended in disaster,” said one Republican congressional staffer. “The Muslim ban and the immigration executive order are things that have activated both sides of the aisle and caused widespread pushback and disgust. I just think the president should think twice before following in his lead in the future on these issues.”&nbsp;[Politico]  2018 WATCH --&nbsp;Moulton urges Bloomberg to back vets’ races -- by Liz Goodwin:&nbsp;&quot;Eight years ago, a young Marine Corps veteran approached Mayor Michael Bloomberg while Bloomberg was eating a hamburger with his then-girlfriend at J.G. Melon on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. The Marine interrupted Bloomberg’s meal to tell him that he had strong feelings on the mayor’s controversial support for a group that wanted to build a mosque near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Bloomberg braced himself. “This is going to ruin my hamburger,” he thought. “I really appreciate your stance on the mosque because I think you’re upholding the values that I fought for overseas,” the veteran told Bloomberg, shocking the mayor.&quot;  &quot;Years later, the mogul is now helping that veteran, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, in Moulton’s political time of need. Bloomberg announced this week he’s spending $80 million this cycle to boost Democratic candidates, which, according to longtime aide Howard Wolfson, will include at least some of the military veterans Moulton has helped assemble to run for House seats.&quot;&nbsp;[BostonGlobe]</p> \n<p>** Good Friday Morning!

I really don’t understand it. First of all, we’re a country of immigrants. I’m the great-granddaughter of an immigrant. I went back to Ukraine, which is where my family came from. I went to the 75th anniversary of Babi Yar, where the 32,000 Jews were killed. Frankly, I wouldn’t be alive today if my great-grandfather had not immigrated. We have benefited from immigration. We’ve benefited not just economically but as the mosaic that is our country has benefited from all kinds of thinking.&quot; [Recode]&nbsp;  Charlottesville rally organizer requests permit for 'white civil rights rally' in Washington -- by&nbsp;Sophie Tatum:&nbsp;&quot;The organizer of last year's deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, is looking to hold a &quot;white civil rights rally&quot; in front of the White House in August.

Instead, the move has created a backlash. The latest setback threatens the contested city’s hopes of hosting the 2019 Eurovision song contest — an affair that has become something of a national obsession... Hosting the competition in Jerusalem could present a predicament for the public broadcasters that make up the European Broadcasting Union, sparking criticism that they are taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EBU took the unusual step of announcing this week that it will choose the host city after a bid process. Israel is expected to present four cities as potential hosts, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.” [AP]  Anti-Israeli Former MP George Galloway Spotted Dining at an... Israeli Cafe -- by&nbsp;Eylon Aslan-Levy:&nbsp;&quot;Anti-Israel politician George Galloway was spotted having lunch at an Israeli cafe in London’s Camden Market on Thursday afternoon. Galloway, a former British MP, is known as one of the vociferous voices against Israel in Britain. He is a firm supporter of a boycott against Israel, who once declared Bradford—the northern English city where he was the local MP—as an “Israeli free zone”... Yet, all these staunchly anti-Israeli opinions did not stop Galloway from walking into an Israeli-owned cafe and enjoying a quintessentially Israeli breakfast: A shakshuka, which he picked from a menu that included such Israeli delights as challah bread, borekas, and Jerusalem salad.&quot; [Tablet]  WEEKEND BIRTHDAYS -- FRIDAY: A leading securities, corporate and M&amp;A attorney, he is a founding partner of the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, Martin Lipton turns 87...&nbsp;United States Senator from California since 1992, Dianne Feinstein turns 85...&nbsp;Jerusalem-born 2009 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, she is the director of a research center at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Ada Yonath turns 79...&nbsp;UK judge, who chaired high profile hearings on ethics in the media, prompted by the 2011 News of the World phone hacking affair, Sir Brian Henry Leveson turns 75...&nbsp;Winner of the the 2016 Nobel Prize for Physics, professor at Brown University, J.

The two organizations claimed responsibility for the 45 rockets fired at Gaza border communities Tuesday night, claiming they were a response to Israel's strike. The Israeli military had struck Hamas infrastructure in the Strip in response to burning balloons being launched from the enclave into Israel.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are committed to a formula of a strike for every strike. We will not allow the enemy to dictate a new formula,&quot; said the statement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Hamas Changes Tactics: Even Non-lethal Israeli Strikes Now Met by Rockets</p> \n<p>Following the statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: &quot;I don't intend to elaborate on the moves against Gaza. The force will increase as necessary.&quot; Speaking at an Israeli army officer's course graduation ceremony, Netanyahu added that &quot;we are prepared for every scenario, and it would be best for our enemies to understand that here and now.&quot;</p> \n<p>Attending the same ceremony, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called Hamas' move &quot;a mistake.&quot; Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot added that Israel will &quot;continue to strike those who seek to harm us, and retrieve security for residents of the south as well as the rest of the country, and I'm assured we will achieve this with swift determination and wisdom.&quot;</p> \n<p>Also Wednesday, Islamic Jihad spokesman in Gaza, Daoud&nbsp;Shihab, said that &quot;the Gaza Strip isn't going to be a firing range for Israeli F-16s.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The time when the occupation had freedom of movement is over. It is the duty of the resistance forces to react according to the circumstances in the field and as they see fit,&quot; continued Shihab.</p> \n<p>Later on Wednesday, the IDF confirmed its drone had fired at a group of Gazans who were attempting to launch burning kites in the north of the Gaza Strip. In addition, the Israeli military said it fired a warning shot at a group of Palestinians launching flammable balloons from the Strip toward Israel. No casualties were reported.</p> \n<p>Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted seven of the 45 rockets fired Tuesday night and at least three landed inside the Gaza Strip. In response, the IDF again attacked the Strip, targeting a total of 25 Hamas targets.</p> \n<p>Army sources say that Hamas' decision to carry out its attacks during the nighttime hours, when residents of Israeli border communities are at home and close to shelters, demonstrates that the Islamist movement is using a measure of discretion. The fact that Hamas has been firing rockets at small communities rather than large cities is also seen as an indictation of caution on its part, officials believe.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the military acknowledges that the current situation could create tensions between the army and residents in the south. The IDF has yet to announce any change in policy toward Hamas, and officers stress that the view that Hamas should be attacked in response to incendiary&nbsp; kites and balloons sent over the border into Israel continues to prevail.</p>",

They raised $814 million last year, triple the 2015 level, and $182 million in the first quarter of 2018, in line with last year’s pace, according to Start-Up Nation Central.</p> \n<p>Investment in Israeli autotech including venture capital, acquisitions and joint ventures, totaled $3.5 billion in 2017, said Micki Shapira, a partner at law firm Weinstock Zecler &amp; Company.</p> \n<p>Startups elsewhere are making a push. Beijing has emerged as a hot spot, with strong backing from the Chinese government.</p> \n<p>But Israel’s innovation, often in elite military departments such as the cyber intelligence Unit 8200, wireless sensors, security, location finding and analytics software means it is well positioned to rival Silicon Valley. Cybersecurity expertise ensures that the computers of driverless cars keep hackers out while radar, sonar, sensors and positioning systems are used to keep the cars on the road and stop them crashing into other vehicles or objects.</p> \n<p>Cyber- and fraud-detection techniques are rooted in counterterrorism while breakthroughs in optical and sonar software may stem from missile defense, said Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally.</p> \n<p>On an empty highway built by Israel’s government to test self-driving cars near Shfayim, north of Tel Aviv, a Samsung-backed startup called Imagry last month demonstrated its technology on a modified Kia Soul. The five-seater, equipped with cameras, infrared and artificial intelligence, kept a safe distance from another car.</p> \n<p>Autonomy — without relying on the expensive laser detection system known as lidar that Waymo and GM use — has become a quest for the industry. “Cameras provide the most high-resolution information and they are available and commoditized,” said Imagry’s chief executive officer, Adham Ghazali. His goal is to produce cheaper technology than lidar.</p> \n<p>Another Samsung-backed startup, Innoviz, whose CEO spent seven years in an elite technological unit of the IDF’s Intelligence Corps, wants to lower the cost of lidar rather than replace it.</p> \n<p>Together with partner Magna it signed a deal last month to supply lidar to BMW. Innoviz raised $73 million in 2017.</p> \n<p>With full autonomy — a market UBS estimates will be worth up to $2.3 trillion in 2030 — a long way off, Ghazali aims to have 20 robotaxis operating in Israel and the United States next year at “level 4” autonomy with a safety driver present.</p> \n<p>Israel’s auto tech sector started to take off in 2014, the year after Google bought mapping firm Waze for $1.2 billion.</p> \n<p>Another big step was when Intel spent $15.3 billion on autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and moved all its operations in the field to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“We were not known as a country that provides technology to the automotive industry and suddenly you have more than 500 different startups dealing with ... the automotive industry,” Mobileye co-founder Ziv Aviram said.</p> \n<p>German auto supplier Continental bought cybersecurity firm Argus, whose CEO was a captain in Unit 8200, for about $430 million last year. Samsung’s Harman unit acquired cyberfirm TowerSec for $75 million in 2016.</p> \n<p>Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, VW , Porsche and Honda also have interests in Israel.</p> \n<p>“We are going to do more here,” said Nick Sugimoto, head of Honda Innovations.</p> \n<p>The government is keen to support the sector. It is building a simulator for test drives and working on regulation to balance safety with innovation, said Gil Shaki, head of energy, cleantech and transport at the Innovation Authority.</p> \n<p>But there are still challenges for auto companies dealing with Israeli startups.</p> \n<p>“You don’t have tremendous knowledge about how to take a technology that’s in a nascent state and take it down the path...to automotive grade,” said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of Aptiv, a major automotive supplier that is developing safety and autonomous driving systems.</p> \n<p>The startups are sometimes surprised that it can take five years to get a product launched on a car, and a decade to achieve significant sales volume, he said.</p> \n<p>Distance from other car centers can also be a problem.“It’s harder to get there,” said De Vos, who is based in Silicon Valley.</p> \n<p>A challenge for the startups is the competition for staff with giant international firms such as Google or Intel.</p> \n<p>The government forecasts a shortage of 10,000 engineers and programmers over the next decade in the tech sector in general, which already employs 270,000.</p> \n<p>Many of the startups pivoted to autos from other fields. StoreDot, which raised $60 million from Daimler in September and another $20 million from BP last Tuesday, developed a super-fast charger for cellphones before switching to automotives. The company, valued at $750 million according to startup marketplace Funderbeam, says its batteries can fully charge an electric vehicle in five minutes.</p> \n<p>“Both are big markets but we tend to think the electric vehicle market will be much bigger,” said Erez Lorber, chief operating officer of StoreDot.</p> \n<p>Arbe Robotics, which has roots in the military and homeland security, built radar for drones before moving into cars, said CEO Kobi Merenko.</p> \n<p>Interest in the sector has pushed up valuations, said Yifat Oron, CEO of Bank Leumi’s tech arm LeumiTech.</p> \n<p>If a startup in an early fundraising round once raised $3-$5 million, it could now get $20 million and hundreds of millions of dollars at later stages.</p> \n<p>“There’s always overexcitement as happened with the cybersecurity sector,” she said. “Maybe it will be corrected a little, but we can’t see this happening in the near or mid-term.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“They see traffic jams; I see interchanges,” was the unforgettable statement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once made to the media. While a good deal of the media is part of the personality cult around him, Netanyahu — in that haggling-victimized way of his — continues to strike out against it, calling it “an industry of despondency.” But it is actually the traffic example that he chose that highlights one of his biggest and most depressing failures, which is a direct result of his socioeconomic worldview.</p> \n<p>In the Netanyahu era, as prime minister and finance minister, five comprehensive government plans have been prepared on the transportation situation. All of them made clear the huge damage caused by the increased use of cars instead of public transportation. They all warned of the traffic jams that lead to huge losses in economic productivity — worth tens of millions of shekels a year. The emotional damage and the negative effects on the time and quality of life of each of us is hard to measure, although the pollution and accidents certainly can be. In the Netanyahu governments’ plans, it was made clear that the only solution, as is the norm worldwide, certainly in densely populated areas, is to increase the use of public transportation instead of passenger cars. But these recommendations will never be implemented.</p> \n<p>This bitter conclusion is not the product of the mind of a sourpuss journalist. It was written explicitly in a report two years ago from the State Comptroller's Office. Since then the situation has only grown worse. Israelis spend an average of more than an hour in traffic each day. By the end of the next decade, it will be two hours a day. Why? Because the number of cars has skyrocketed and there’s no way to build roads at such a pace. A lot of roads have actually been built in Israel, but we have also reached the conclusion that the whole world already knows: New roads don’t reduce congestion; they only increase it. The solution is public transportation, but that is where the big problem lies.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Driving to work in Tel Aviv at seven miles per hour: The numbers behind Israel's traffic woes</p> \n<p>&quot;Public&quot; is the word Netanyahu hates most. Public health, public education, public housing and public transportation. He does them as much harm as he can, because the prime minister hates what is socially minded and loves private enterprise, and what’s more private than a passenger car? Except that there’s nothing private about a car, just as there’s nothing private about a private hospital or a private school. They all exist at the expense of the public, except for those few with connections, into whose pockets astronomical sums flow. When Netanyahu speaks of backups, he is actually thinking about hospital patients, thinking: &quot;They see the congestion in the emergency room and when I get there, a private doctor and a private room are waiting for me.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu despises public expenditures that take the entire public into account and is shifting the major burden to individual citizens. In the Netanyahu era, Israel has grown to become one of the leading countries when it comes to what citizens have to pay for education and health. What does that mean? That if you have money you’ll have good health care, while if you don’t have money, that’s your problem. And after all, the prime minister thinks: &quot;What are you complaining about here? They see the disabled and the sick; I see the healthy and the strong.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s selfish worldview sanctifies privatization, but like many other steps taken in the name of the “private citizen,” they do not benefit those citizens, instead helping only the few at the expense of the many.</p> \n<p>Private health care is a cancer eating away at the health and the pocketbook of individual citizens for the benefit of the insurance tycoons and the wealthy. Private transportation is a particularly horrific money-guzzler — from car importers to highway contractors and leasing companies. Israelis pay a huge portion of their taxes for the construction of heavy infrastructure, and their use of passenger cars is among the most expensive in the world — the cost of the car, the gas, insurance, repairs and parking. And what do they get in return for this huge outlay? A horrible “user experience.” The roads in Israel are more crowded than any other developed country in the OECD. By contrast, any number related to Israeli public transportation is dramatically lower than in Europe. Except for one, which is particularly high: the time it takes a bus to arrive on the Sabbath.</p>",

Ronen Lubarsky at the military cemetery on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem&nbsp;on Saturday night.</p> \n<p>Lubarsky, a 20-year-old soldier from the IDF's elite Duvdevan unit, died on Saturday&nbsp;from injuries he suffered during a military raid on a West Bank&nbsp;refugee to arrest wanted suspects early Thursday morning. Lubarsky was critically injured when Palestinians dropped a heavy stone slab on his head from the third floor of a building during the raid.</p> \n<p>Arik Lubarsky, Ronen’s brother, eulogized him: “My dear brother, how have we reached this strange situation, tell me? You were so modest. Everyone is talking about you, everyone loves you, what a hero you are, how you are the best.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Unfortunately, IDF soldiers deal with the threats you overcame every day, every night. .. Wild animals were waiting for you on the rooftops. I pray to God that our leaders, who I love, will do something about it.”</p> \n<p>A., the commander of Duvdevan, also spoke. He said Lubarsky was taught the value of contributing to his country, a member of a family of fighters, the salt of the earth. “During the hours we prayed at your bedside in the hospital, your mother pointed to the members of the family and said: ‘Combat soldiers every one, but Ronen was the best.’ Your mother was right. You were one of the best soldiers in the unit.” A. said Lubarsky participated in a great number of operations to capture terrorists and stood at the IDF’s “spearhead against terrorism,” and “fell as a hero in an operation to defend the citizens of Israel Rest in peace. We are proud of your acts, pained and salute you.”</p> \n<p>Deputy Defense Minister Eli Ben-Dahan spoke about Lubarsky at the funeral too. “I call on the Arabs living in Judea and Samaria: You can choose the path of peace and benefit from the prosperity. But those who choose the path of terror and murder – know you will run into a fortified wall.”</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow over the news of Lubarsky's death on Saturday. &quot;I send heartfelt condolences to his family,&quot; Netanyahu said Saturday evening. &quot;The security forces will catch the terrorist and the State of Israel will bring him to justice.&quot;</p> \n<p>The unit that carried out the raid at the al-Am’ari Refugee Camp near Ramallah was unable to shoot at or pursue the attacker as they could not identify who had thrown the slab.</p> \n<p>The first set of Israeli forces that arrived at the site for the raid was undercover and surrounded the building where the wanted men were located. A larger force of the Duvdevan unit equipped with full protective gear arrived afterwards, including Lubarsky.</p> \n<p>The military said the raid, which targeted members of a cell involved in recent terrorist attacks and shootings against Israelis, took place after intelligence information indicated the wanted men intended on carrying out another attack soon. The forces surrounded the buildings where the wanted men were thought to be hiding. A suspect was arrested during the raid and two other suspects were arrested later in the day. The suspects had been transferred to the Shin Bet security service for questioning.</p> \n<p>After being attacked, Lubarsky was evacuated to the Hadassah University Hospital in Ein Karem in Jerusalem, and was sedated and on a respirator for two days, before succumbing to his injuries on Saturday. Though he was wearing full protective gear at the time of the incident, the impact of the slab shattered his helmet and caused a severe blow to his head.</p> \n<p>Duvdevan is an elite special forces unit which carries out the largest number of anti-terrorism operations in the West Bank, and the unit has made over 150 arrests of Palestinians suspected of involvement in terrorism since the beginning of this year.</p> \n<p>Lubarsky's death brings the amount of fallen Duvdevan soldiers to 18 since the unit was established in 1986. Most of the fallen soldiers were killed in training accidents or as a result of friendly fire during an operation&nbsp;– none of them were killed by enemy fire. Some of the soldiers who were killed served in an intelligence unit attached to Duvdevan in recent years, but were killed before the two units were combined.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Why do Jews care so much about putative leftists buddying up to Louis Farrakhan?</p> \n<p>The question has come up again, as Women’s March Co-Leader Tamika Mallory attended a speech by Farrakhan where he unleashed his usual fusillade of anti-Semitic invective.</p> \n<p>Mallory eagerly promoted her attendance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Then, faced with widespread criticism from the Jewish community, she dug in her heels.</p> \n<p>Far from exhibiting any contrition or even curiosity as to why Jews might find being blamed for (among other things) &quot;all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out&quot; repulsive, or that Jews might be offended when he declared he'd &quot;pulled the cover off the eyes of the Satanic Jew...I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through,&quot; Mallory instead unleashed a corker of a response to her Jewish critics: &quot;If your leader does not have the same enemies as Jesus, they may not be THE leader!&quot;</p> \n<p>In context, it was less of anti-Semitic dog-whistle than a bullhorn.</p> \n<p>That didn’t stop Mallory from some textbook gaslighting, saying, &quot;Funny how folks interpreted my mention of one having enemies the same as Jesus, as me describing a certain group of people. That’s your own stuff.&quot;</p> \n<p>Yes. Funny.</p> \n<p>As the controversy proceeded, things only deteriorated. Fellow Women’s March leader Linda Sarsour managed to wait to intercede until the most anti-Semitic possible moment, rising to promote a minister who first tried to “but Israel” the controversy, then told his Jewish interlocutor that her “wicked spirit” would hopefully be banished by the blood of Christ.</p> \n<p>As for Mallory, she has continued to defiantly refuse to distance herself from Farrakhan’s vicious anti-Semitism (and homophobia, and transphobia). Instead, she has insisted on her own upstanding character and declared, as against those who don’t &quot;understand how we [in the black community] organize,&quot; that &quot;I will not be bullied!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Outside of the Women’s March hierarchy, Mallory has plenty of defenders; albeit virtually none who will back Farrakhan directly. Rather, the most common response has been one of deflection.</p> \n<p>Many, like Shaun King&nbsp;and Symone D. Sanders, have sought to turn the debate into whether it is fair to call her a &quot;bigot&quot; - as if the most pressing question was the state of Mallory’s soul.</p> \n<p>I’m not unsympathetic to the desire to defend a friend - even one who is royally screwing up - from charges she is a monster. But at the very least, there needs to be recognition of the screw up, and that many of the critiques neither depend upon, nor have any interest in, accusing the friend of monstrosity.</p> \n<p>Otherwise we’re just reliving the same nonsense we just went through with Bari Weiss: First taking perfectly cogent critiques of an obvious misstep and reframing them in the most inflammatory terms possible, then professing outrage at the inflammation.</p> \n<p>(Much like with l’affaire Weiss, one suspects this whole controversy would have blown over quickly had the relevant parties simply conceded error and pledged to do better. Instead, we got increasingly obstinate double-downs and utter refusal to cede an inch, all of which ironically starts to give weight to the more serious charges of ingrained bias. Anyone can make a mistake, but when this mistake is the hill you decide to die on it becomes fair to ask questions as to why.)</p> \n<p>To be sure, the defense of Mallory hasn’t been universal. Diane Alston&nbsp; sharply condemned the Women’s March leadership for its inability to condemn Farrakhan, while Aminatou Sow gave a simple, &quot;This one’s not hard, Women’s March.&quot; Rabia Chaudry pointed out how outlier Farrakhan is in the U.S. Muslim community - and called its members out for not condemning him.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Inside the Women’s March leadership, however, it was left to Sophie Ellman-Golan - the most senior Jewish figure in the organization - to issue the sole unequivocal denunciation of Farrakhan’s repulsive views (though she has remained maddeningly oblique in failing to directly call her colleagues to account.)</p> \n<p>Yet of all the twists and turns this saga has taken, perhaps the most interesting is to think about the implications of the question posed at the outset: Why is someone like Louis Farrakhan (or even Tamika Mallory) worth all this fuss?</p> \n<p>David Klion took this approach: agreeing that Farrakhan is an anti-Semite, but suggesting that his influence is negligible compared to right-wing anti-Semites and thus not worth paying attention to.</p> \n<p>Several months earlier, Linda Sarsour made a similar argument at the notorious New School panel on anti-Semitism: Why, given the rise of alt-right anti-Semitism whose influence extends all the way to the Oval Office, do Jews care about what a relatively powerless, over-the-hill black preacher is saying? Even JTA got into the act with a telling headline: &quot;Louis Farrakhan is an anti-Semite. Is he still relevant?&quot;</p> \n<p>Of course, the easiest answer to this is to observe that Farrakhan apparently remains influential enough to attract the fulsome praise of some of the most prominent feminist leaders in America.</p> \n<p>Still, on one level, questioning why Jews care so much about fringe black preachers or even newly-emergent feminist leaders makes perfect sense.</p> \n<p>In 2018, a white supremacist with swastikas carved into his gun murdered five Jews at Stoneman Douglas High School. Another far-right extremist stabbed a gay Jewish teenager to death in California.</p> \n<p>The 2018 Jewish death toll from intersectional feminists (or Nation of Islam preachers), by contrast, remains at zero.</p> \n<p>When some on the Jewish right make the ridiculous assertion that Jews are objectively more threatened by left-wing anti-Semitism than rightward counterparts, it isn’t wrong to ask them to recheck their calculations.</p> \n<p>On another level, however, the claimed befuddlement as to why Jews care about leftists - out-of-power, comparatively marginal - praising Farrakhan is sadly revealing regarding how some on the left conceptualize Jews. For there is an obvious reason why Jews might take it extra hard when persons on the left endorse the rank bigotry of Louis Farrakhan.</p> \n<p>It’s because most of us are of the left too. And there’s nothing strange about feeling extra hurt when members of your own community are the one’s causing the wound.</p> \n<p>This reason is so obvious that it’s worth dwelling on why it is so often overlooked. And here we begin to see the real stakes of the controversy: whether Jews are indeed recognized as members of this left-liberal community.</p> \n<p>While both left- and right-wing anti-Semitism matter to Jews, they affect us along very different vectors.</p> \n<p>Put bluntly, in the United States the anti-Semitism that is most likely to put a bullet in my brain emanates from the right. That matters, and nobody should be in denial about that raw and sobering fact.</p> \n<p>But on a day-to-day basis, left-wing anti-Semitism is far more likely to obstruct Jews from joining movements we want to join, or force us out of communities and spaces which are very much ours.</p> \n<p>Deeply embedded in the puzzlement over Jewish concern in cases like this is the assumption that the left is not our home; that Jews come to this controversy as strangers. The Jewish presence on the left is always at best probationary, and so any time Jews criticize the left we prove we are unworthy of membership. Those who would self-identify as left are denied that label. We are infiltrators, rabble-rousers, coming in under false pretenses.</p> \n<p>Hence Klion’s declaration that, &quot;The Jews leading this charge are not lefty and do not have the left’s best interests at heart.&quot;</p> \n<p>I won’t get into a debate as to whether Jewish commentators who have criticized Mallory like Elad Nehorai or Daniel Sieradski, or Yair Rosenberg are sufficiently &quot;lefty.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s a trap. Jewish criticism of the left can never come from inside the left; the fact of the critique proves we’re not and never were one of them to begin with.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And so Jews are experiencing a doubly-marginalizing hit.</p> \n<p>First, there’s the feeling of betrayal. And then there’s the realization that Mallory and her defenders can’t even conceive of it as a &quot;betrayal,&quot; because &quot;betrayal&quot; implies we were recognized co-community members to begin with.</p> \n<p>The only reason it’s hard to understand why Jews care about left-wing anti-Semitism is if one implicitly doesn’t believe Jews should care about the goings on of the left, because one does not see Jews as fundamentally part of the left.</p> \n<p>But many - most - of us are. So when I watch conservatives play footsie with Holocaust deniers and alt-right neo-Nazis it is simultaneously more worrisome, because conservatives currently control the levers of American power, and less worrisome because I’m not a conservative. I have no ties to them. I have no expectations from them. And I certainly have no desire to become one.</p> \n<p>When the left partakes in anti-Semitism, by contrast, it is infecting the political community and project that embody my hopes for the future. I have every right to care about that. I have every right to stake my claim to this space, to participate in the development of this project as an equal member. I do not come to this cause as a stranger.</p> \n<p>Which should I care more about: that the powerful people I consider my adversaries hate me, or that the people who are alongside me organizing the resistance to that power don’t care about me?</p> \n<p>It is a question that only makes sense if one thinks Jews don’t already come with political attachments that matter to us. It is a question that, upon being asked, answers why even Jews on the left know they will never be acknowledged to be at home on the left.</p> \n<p>David Schraub is a lecturer in law and senior research fellow at the California Constitution Center, UC Berkeley School of Law.

But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit,” Farrow wrote in a 4,600-word&nbsp;post&nbsp;on his personal blog on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Farrow said he was age 14 and was present, as were three other adults, when the alleged molestation is said to have taken place, and that no such assault occurred.</p> \n<p>In the wake of accusations by dozens of women against movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the start of the #MeToo movement, Allen’s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow revived her accusation that the acclaimed director had molested her in her mother Mia Farrow’s home&nbsp;when she was 7 years old in 1992.</p> \n<p>In an interview in January, Dylan Farrow told CBS This Morning that she was inspired after hearing the stories of so many other “brave” individuals who have told of their own assaults by powerful men. She had previously discussed the alleged incident in a&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;article&nbsp;in 2014.</p> \n<p>Moses Farrow wrote in his&nbsp;blog post&nbsp;that Allen was in the house while Mia Farrow was out shopping. The couple was in a custody battle for the children they had adopted together and Mia Farrow had told all of the children to be careful when Allen was around because he was a “monster.”</p> \n<p>“As the ‘man of the house’ that day, I had promised to keep an eye out for any trouble, and I was doing just that. I remember where Woody sat in the TV room, and I can picture where Dylan and Satchel were. Not that everybody stayed glued to the same spot, but I deliberately made sure to note everyone’s coming and going,” Moses Farrow wrote. “Along with five kids, there were three adults in the house, all of whom had been told for months what a monster Woody was. None of us would have allowed Dylan to step away with Woody, even if he tried.”</p> \n<p>Satchel, who is Allen’s biological son, later changed his name to Ronan. He became an accomplished journalist who ultimately broke the story of the accusations against Weinstein for The New Yorker.</p> \n<p>Moses Farrow also wrote that Mia had been abusive to her adoptive and biological children, especially to Soon-Yi Previn, who later married Allen.</p> \n<p>Farrow claims his mother used to hit him and make him rehearse apologies to her.</p> \n<p>“That was the start of her coaching, drilling, scripting, and rehearsing – in essence, brainwashing. I became anxious and fearful. Once, when I was given a new pair of jeans, I thought they would look cool if I cut off a couple of the belt loops. When Mia saw what I had done, she spanked me repeatedly and had me remove all my clothing, saying, ‘You’re not deserving of any clothes’ and making me stand naked in the corner of her room,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>In response to the blogpost, Dylan Farrow&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;on Twitter: “As I said when he last made these claims, this is an attempt to deflect from a credible allegation made by an adult woman, by trying to impugn my mother who has only ever been supportive of me and my siblings. It’s easily disproven, contradicts years of his own statements, is beyond hurtful to me personally, and is part of a larger effort to discredit and distract from my assault. My brother is a troubled person. I’m so sorry he’s doing this.”</p> \n<p>Allen has denied that he ever molested his adopted daughter, and an investigation in 1993 determined that Dylan Farrow was&nbsp;coached&nbsp;to make the accusation, which she denies.</p> \n<p>Moses Farrow is married and has a family, and works as a licensed family therapist.</p>",

The Jerusalem school will open in September in the Kiryat Menachem neighborhood, and the registration process will be the same as for any municipal preschool.</p> \n<p>Lockheed Martin said it only pays for the preschools’ science curriculum, not the entire curriculum. Its funding also covers renovations to support the technological orientation, such as constructing “science and technology stations” in the classroom.</p> \n<p>“We’re supporting them financially, but we don’t have teachers in the preschools and we’re not intervening in the programming or curriculum,” said Joshua Shani, CEO of Lockheed Martin Israel.</p> \n<p>Shani said it costs about $250,000 to set up such a preschool, and Lockheed Martin covers the bulk of this cost.

        "text":["<p>A Hollywood star, an acclaimed Israeli novelist and an award-winning Russian director – all Jewish – walk onto a kibbutz. It could be the opening of a Borscht Belt joke, or perhaps a Zionist fantasy of an artistic ingathering of the exiles.</p> \n<p>In fact, it describes the mid-May scene in the Judean Hills, as Harvey Keitel, Meir Shalev and Pavel Lungin bond over a bottle of Arak at Kibbutz Harel, west of Jerusalem. Sitting at a plastic-topped picnic table, the three artists have turned their press interview, during a break in filming of Shalev’s novel “Esau,” into an impromptu mid-afternoon drinking party.</p> \n<p>Behind them, the “Esau” production team, cast and crew chat busily in a mixture of Russian, Hebrew and accented English – while the three men discuss the merits of various brands of the anise-flavored drink.</p> \n<p>At first, Keitel resists Lungin’s entreaties to taste his favorite Lebanese brand, knowing that afternoon drinking on set – ahead of a dinner date with his wife and mother-in-law – is probably not the best idea. Eventually, though, he relents, and the movie legend raises his cup in Lungin and Shalev’s direction, toasting “the wonderfulness of all of us coming together to tell this story.”</p> \n<p>For all three, the work-in-progress represents a first. Keitel, 79, had never made a film in Israel before, and portraying Shalev’s patriarch, Abraham Levy, is a rare occasion for him to play a character who is Jewish but not a gangster – as he did in his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Mickey Cohen in Warren Beatty’s “Bugsy” (1991).</p> \n<p>The Brooklyn-born actor may be the son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, but in the Hollywood pantheon he is more closely associated with Italian Americans like Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro for memorable turns in classics “Mean Streets” (1973) and “Taxi Driver” (1976), along with his searing romantic performance as a Scottish immigrant in Jane Campion’s “The Piano” (1993), and iconic turn as “The Wolf” in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” (1994). Here, he is playing far from type as an aging, ailing Jewish father in a shapeless cardigan and house slipper-style shoes, growling passive aggressively at his resentful son, Esau (played by Lior Ashkenazi).</p> \n<p>For Shalev, 69, Lungin’s interest in his 1991 novel – a contemporary retelling of the biblical “Jacob and Esau” story – marks the first time one of his more than 30 books of fiction, nonfiction or children’s literature has been adapted into a feature film.</p> \n<p>In the past, he says, “there were many attempts by Israeli directors and writers to turn novels of mine into films. But they failed at the stage of script writing. I think they liked the books too much and tried to take as much as possible from the book. This is the first time someone has managed to emerge with a successful script, and I’m very happy about it.”</p> \n<p>Completing the series of firsts, this is the debut English-language film for Lungin, 68, an acclaimed Russian filmmaker who won the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival for “Taxi Blues” in 1990. He is also known for the film “Luna Park” and co-creating the Russian TV series “Rodina,” which is based on Israel’s “Hatufim” – itself the inspiration for the American TV series “Homeland.” Lungin was awarded his country’s highest artistic honor, the People’s Artist of Russia award, in 2008.</p> \n<p>Shalev’s novel is a multigenerational saga of a family of bakers and is narrated by Esau, who returns home to Israel after spending decades in self-imposed exile in the United States. During his visit, he must face his father and twin brother Jacob, whom he feels has stolen his birthright – carrying on the family baking business and marrying the woman Esau once loved.</p> \n<p>The novel began, Shalev explains, with a simple desire to write about a family that bakes bread. As a student at Hebrew University who worked nights, he was tempted by the scent of Angel Bakery, where he would often stop to buy challah in the wee hours of the morning. It was only mid-writing that he realized the story of sibling rivalry he was crafting was essentially a modern retelling of the biblical story and he changed the main character’s name to Esau.</p> \n<p>Though it is a Jewish and Israeli story, Shalev believes it crosses cultures and is easy for his Russian director and American star to grasp, and for non-Israeli audiences to relate to. “The classical themes of literature – love, longing, family relationships: these are 4,000 years old and they are universal,” says the writer.</p> \n<p>Lungin approached Shalev about turning “Esau” into a film four years ago. When the script was ready, he reached out to Keitel. The director says he had long been “a great admirer” of the actor, whom he first met decades earlier at Cannes,</p> \n<p>“Knowing his work from ‘Taxi Blues’ and having met him so many years ago, I was definitely interested,” says Keitel. “He’s just the kind of director I like to work with.”</p> \n<p>Keitel at the Kotel</p> \n<p>Despite the relatively spartan and unglamorous conditions and political volatility, the idea of shooting on a kibbutz in Israel never dissuaded him. “Who could not be interested in Israel?” Keitel asks rhetorically.</p> \n<p>After three days of intensive shooting, Keitel admits to feeling tired but also good and in his element.</p> \n<p>“I’m working on a project I really love, working with a director I love. The people of Israel, I’ve worked with before, but never in this country itself. The vibe of the people here is something very...” He searches for the right word, before opting for “other.”</p> \n<p>It’s a vibe Keitel is familiar with. His wife, Daphna Kastner, was born in Montreal and spent summers visiting her extended family in Haifa. The couple combined the movie shoot in Israel with their 13-year-old son Roman’s bar mitzvah, which the family celebrated at the Western Wall before the shoot.</p> \n<p>“To stand by the Kotel was an experience that I haven’t got the words to describe. The history of it, the image of it,” Keitel reflects. He has warm words for the rabbis who performed the ceremony. “The wonderful religious men I met there gave me a deeper knowledge than I possessed about the meaning of Israel. And I am very grateful to them for that.”</p> \n<p>The rabbis, he says, referred to “Israel as a house of study. What a wonderful way to think of your country.”</p> \n<p>The two Israeli actors who are ostensibly the film’s leads say the triumvirate of Keitel, Shalev and Lungin made the project a no-brainer for each of them.</p> \n<p>Ashkenazi, who plays Esau, has starred in a long list of Israeli films, beginning with 2001’s “Late Marriage,” with more recent turns in “Footnote” (2011) and “Foxtrot” (2017). Keitel isn’t the only Hollywood legend he’s shared the screen with, having recently also co-starred with Richard Gere in Joseph Cedar’s “Norman” (2016).</p> \n<p>Mark Ivanir, who plays Jacob, is a veteran of three Steven Spielberg films and is arguably the hardest-working Israeli actor in Hollywood. A familiar face to fans of “Homeland” and “Transparent,” he is Hollywood’s go-to actor when casting Russian oligarchs and guys called Dmitri, and may end up rivaling Keitel when it comes to playing gangsters.</p> \n<p>Both Ashkenazi and Ivanir are 49, and both remember reading “Esau” when it was first published in 1991. Both have also long admired Keitel and Lungin’s work. “It is a project that reminds you why you became an actor,“ admits Ivanir.</p> \n<p>Art in the corner</p> \n<p>Israel is never a dull place. But as luck would have it, Keitel’s time on the set coincided with two of the most eventful weeks in recent memory: From U.S. President Donald Trump’s nixing of the Iran deal, to cross-border skirmishes between Israel and Syria/Iran, the moving of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and deadly violence on the Gaza border.</p> \n<p>Keitel shrugs off any worry over taking heat for filming in Israel. “Those who would be critical of making a movie here – I’d say these are the kind of people we are making the movie for,” he says.</p> \n<p>For Shalev, separating art from politics is a regular habit. He devotes one day each week to the newspaper column he writes about politics for leading Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth, and devotes himself to fiction every other day.</p> \n<p>“I don’t like to read political novels and I don’t like to write them,” he says. “I’m political when I write my column or argue with my friends. But I feel like even in Israel, in a politics-infested country, I have the right to do my art in my corner, away from the daily reality.”</p> \n<p>For Lungin, though, keeping the political reality out of his art has never been an option: He came of age as an artist in the then-Soviet Union, making films as his country was undergoing tremendous upheaval. Nowadays, he must maneuver in President Vladimir Putin’s Russia. He prefers not to elaborate on the current era, saying only that “even to breathe in Russia has become more difficult,” but does note that “perhaps a little bit of difficulty makes an artist stronger.”</p> \n<p>Like Keitel and Shalev, he’s much more comfortable when the conversation moves away from politics and back onto culture.</p> \n<p>Asked how he gets into character as an actor, the method-trained Keitel describes it – and filmmaking – as a mysterious and transformative process. “It’s an elixir,” he says. “Like when you make straw into gold. What’s the word for it? Alchemy.” Referring to his character’s vocation, he smiles: “It’s like baking bread.”</p> \n<p>Across the table, Lungin has another idea – and once more raises his cup in Keitel and Shalev’s direction. The transformative magic of filmmaking, he ventures, is like good quality Arak. “You take liquid – and it turns into happiness.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s happening right now. The governor of the empire, Jared Kushner, and his assistant, Jason Greenblatt, have come to the region to do what the central Zionist stream has dreamed of doing for many years: Crush the Palestinian people&nbsp; – and not just its national movement, as Saeb Erekat believes.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The first blow was in 1948, when the Palestinian people were broken into four parts: those inside Israel, in the West Bank, in Gaza; and in refugee camps around the world. Now the mission is not just to smash them, but to grind the Palestinian people up finely, grain by grain, each individual separated from his brethren – the West Bank separately, Gaza separately, and then within the West Bank, Ramallah separately and Jenin separately, while abroad the Palestinians in Jordan will be separated from the Palestinians in Lebanon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And this whole project is being labeled “the ultimate deal.” I suggest we change the name to more suitably reflect the reality. How about “the ultimate crime” or “the ultimate destruction,” or maybe both of them together? There’s no doubt: the disgrace here is not just limited to those who are working to implement the “deal,” whatever it’s called, but belongs to the entire world, which remains silent.</p> \n<p>In the past there were those who thought that it was possible to establish two entities here based on principles of justice, at least partial ones, and others who believed that it would be impossible not to have at least pinch of fairness here and a handful of good intentions to mitigate the evil decree. But reality proved the opposite to be true. For each stone built into a wall of an Israeli house, a stone was removed from an Arab house; for every Jewish community built, a Palestinian village was destroyed. Now the village of Khan al-Ahmar is next in line to be uprooted. Let’s congratulate the leaders of the mainstream Zionist enterprise for their tremendous achievement.</p> \n<p>Forgive me for using the term “Zionism” even though there are Zionists who believe in a different path, the one of peace and reconciliation between peoples. But the painful truth is that more than 90 percent of the Zionist parties, whether in silence or with enthusiastic encouragement, watch the crushing of the Palestinians sympathetically and applaud everything the empire’s representatives do.</p> \n<p>Indeed, once again the Israeli leadership is choosing the dark side, turning its back on the peoples of the region. In 1956 David Ben-Gurion hooked up with the dying empires of France and Britain against the Egyptians, whose leader dared to announce&nbsp; the nationalization of the Suez Canal. Later Israel upheld the Shah of Iran’s reign of terror against the Iranian people, a regime that led, because of its brutality, to an even more brutal regime.</p> \n<p>Now Israel is an ally of Saudi Arabia, that vanguard of defense of human rights; of Egypt’s military dictatorship, and of everything that seems benighted in the Arab world. Israel is so absorbed in this role that it has adopted the extreme Wahhabist movement – the&nbsp; ideological basis of fanatic Islamic groups whose only message is hatred and violence.&nbsp; In a video, Maj. Gen. Avihai Edrei, head of the Arab media department at the IDF Spokesperson’s Office, called on the residents of Gaza to adhere to Wahhabism against the Shi’ite threat embodied by Iran and its supporters. One can only be dazzled by the gospel of light that the Jewish state brings to the Arab peoples. In a previous video, Edrei asked Gaza’s women to stay at home.</p> \n<p>It seems that the only stumbling blocks on the way to implementing this plan are the Palestinians, this time headed by the Palestinian leadership, and the progressive Arab and Jewish public in Israel, which includes many Zionists whose Zionism is different from that of Yair Lapid and Avi Gabbay. And I promise you that in a few years’ time, the respected Prof. Shlomo Avineri will write that this time the Palestinians also missed an opportunity. The opportunity to be crushed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Italy’s interior minister recommended creating a “registry” of Roma, his remark was merely the latest addition to a long list of anti-Roma statements by senior European leaders.</p> \n<p>In March,&nbsp;Janos Lazar, the right-hand man for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban,&nbsp;said: “Once we let them in, they will take over.”</p> \n<p>In 2010, Traian Basescu, the president of Romania at the time,&nbsp;said&nbsp;at a news conference about the nomadic ethnic group also known as Gypsies that “very few of them want to work” and “traditionally many of them live off stealing.”</p> \n<p>Yet the remark this week by the interior minister, Matteo Salvini, about a Roma database generated a far greater international outcry, especially from several Jewish groups across Europe. Both the Union of Italian Jewish Communities and the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned it as reminiscent of the Nazi policies inspired by Italy’s fascist movement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; When African refugees board boats to Italy, they know they're going to die</p> \n<p>And whereas some Jewish leaders and groups in Italy and beyond rejected the comparison as exaggerated, the reaction nonetheless underlined once more the unofficial partnership that many European Jews feel toward Roma — perhaps the only ethnic minority that was persecuted by the Nazis during the Holocaust with a murderous tenacity that rivals the one they showed the Jews.</p> \n<p>Salvini’s call for a “registry” resembles “the anti-Semitic legislation adopted by Italy’s fascist government on the eve of the Shoah,“ the British Board said in a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;Thursday. In its&nbsp;statement, the Italian Jewish group wrote that the proposal “reawakens memories of the racist measures taken just 80 years ago and, sadly, increasingly forgotten.”</p> \n<p>The uproar in European Jewish circles over Salvini’s suggestion was the most intense since Marton Gyongyosi, a leading lawmaker for the far-right Jobbik party in Hungary,&nbsp;called&nbsp;during a speech in parliament for a list to be drawn up of Jewish politicians and government members who pose a “threat to national security.” (Gyongyosi later said he meant owners of a dual Israeli and Hungarian citizenship.)</p> \n<p>To Adam Schoenberger, the director of the Marom Hungarian Jewish group that&nbsp;does outreach programs&nbsp;with the country’s large Roma minority, these expressions of solidarity by Jews are a testament to the “shared history and the shared fate” that connects Jews and Roma.</p> \n<p>The Nazis murdered at least 200,000 Roma, often along with the Jews, according to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“When a Roma person is targeted, I feel less safe because I know they will come for me next,” Schoenberger said.</p> \n<p>In Italy, the reference by the country’s Jewish umbrella group to “forgetfulness” about the Holocaust may have been tied to the&nbsp;success&nbsp;in the general elections this year by Salvini’s right-wing populist Northern League party and the anti-migration Five Star Movement.</p> \n<p>Fiamma Nirenstein, a conservative former lawmaker who is Jewish, said the connection is unwarranted.</p> \n<p>The elections and Italy’s fascist past form a “context” that resulted in the international outcry over Salvini’s remark, said Nirenstein, who served in parliament for the center-right party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. “If this were a left-wing government, there wouldn’t be so much attention to the issue.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Not to be outdone by Trump, Italy flirts, dangerously, with fascism | Opinion</p> \n<p>In 1992, Margherita Boniver, a Socialist and then the Italian minister in charge of immigration,&nbsp;proposed having a census of all “migratory people” in Italy – a euphemism for Roma residents.</p> \n<p>To Nirenstein, this shows that the desire for a better oversight of Roma in Italy is not rooted in any fascist tendencies, but real social problems connected to Roma populations in Europe today.</p> \n<p>“Like the fear of getting robbed,” she said in reference to the wide-held belief in Europe that some Roma encampments feature illegal activities. And there’s the issue of school enrollment. “Sadly, many Roma send children to beg or steal instead of sending them to school. That is the reality.”</p> \n<p>Europe has about 12 million Gypsies, a colloquial term for members of the Roma and Sinti ethnicity that many reject as derogatory. Many of them are nomadic, although many have jobs and permanent homes. In Spain, where 750,000 Roma live, only 12 percent reside in substandard housing today, compared to 75 percent 40 years ago, according to the Fundaci&oacute; Secretariado Gitano Roma rights advocacy group.</p> \n<p>And yet across the continent, children and women from Roma camps — often a collection of ramshackle huts or a trailer park in the urban outskirts – enter city centers each morning to beg for money. Some beggars pose as deaf. Some also pickpocket or pull street scams.</p> \n<p>In January, one Roma man, Milo Pavlovic,&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;a rare first-person testimony on the NOS public broadcasting channel about how he was forced into begging and petty crime by his parents in the Netherlands. Born in France on the shoulders of a highway, he arrived in the Netherlands at 7 years old and was denied access to education. His mother told him to learn how to steal, he said.&nbsp;Pavlovic also said he experienced discrimination from Dutch society.</p> \n<p>“My mother would kick me out of the house and was only happy if I came back with jewels or gold,” said Pavlovic, 41.</p> \n<p>While the causes for&nbsp;non-enrollment&nbsp;by Roma children in schools are disputed – many Roma attribute it to bureaucratic inflexibility or discrimination – it is widely accepted that in central and southeastern Europe, only about 20 percent of Roma children complete&nbsp;primary school, and fewer still finish high school.</p> \n<p>“There are real issues,” Nirenstein said, “and there’s nothing fascist about wanting to deal with it.”</p> \n<p>Nirenstein, a former journalist who now lives in Israel and makes frequent trips to Italy, said the statements by the Jewish community in Italy were “a mistake.” But Nirenstein also said she found Salvini’s words “not careful enough because they singled out an ethnic minority at a time where there is already growing concern in a country with an immigration problem” from Africa and the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Many of the Roma living in Italy are believed to be foreign and staying without a visa, Nirenstein said. And those who are legal “don’t pay taxes,” she said.</p> \n<p>“I criticize Salvini’s remarks on the grounds of equality. Of course I feel solidarity with the Gypsies, a kinship even, between fellow victims of the Holocaust,” Nirenstein said. “But equality also means equal compliance to legal duties.”</p> \n<p>Michel Thooris, a Jewish senior police officer in&nbsp;France&nbsp;and founder of a Jewish group that supports that country’s far-right National Front party, blasted allusions to the Holocaust as “a serious moral error.”</p> \n<p>The Italian government, Thooris said, “simply wants to apply the Italian law” also “on immigration.”</p> \n<p>Peter Feldmajer, a former leader of the Mazsihisz federation of Hungarian Jewish communities, said he saw “no connection between the Holocaust” and what Salvini said.</p> \n<p>“I oppose what the Italian minister said not because of the Holocaust, or because I’m a Jew and they’re Gypsies, but simply because it goes against the values of human dignity to make lists according to race, color, origin and so on,” Feldmajer said. “In a democracy, that’s impossible.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK — Natalie Portman has long been a vocal advocate of women’s empowerment and political liberalism, but these days she’s piling another cause onto her heap of activism: animal cruelty and factory farming.</p> \n<p>“It obviously can’t go on this way,” the 37-year-old Oscar-winning actress told a New York audience during the weekend premiere of the documentary “Eating Animals,” which Portman produced and narrated.</p> \n<p>Sharing a title with the book it’s based on, a takeout on America’s meat industry by Jonathan Safran Foer, the film explores factory farming in the United States and how it affects local, independent farmers who are up against big corporations and the complete industrialization of the farming industry.</p> \n<p>Portman, a friend of Safran Foer, had read the book in manuscript form before it was released in 2009. “I was completely changed by it,” the Jerusalem-born actress, who had been a vegetarian since she was 9 and became a vegan after reading the book, said during a Q&amp;A session with director Christopher Quinn, who also wrote the narration.</p> \n<p>Facing powerful industry lobbies that control much of the regulation process by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Portman and her co-filmmakers are defying a strong mainstream path. But the star of “Black Swan” and “Jackie” has never shied away from taking a stance.</p> \n<p>While promoting the film, Portman used the stage of the “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” to call her former Harvard classmate and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, a “supervillain.”</p> \n<p>And in April, Portman refused to attend the Genesis Prize Ceremony in Israel so as not to endorse Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu; it was also a stand against violence, corruption and the abuse of power.</p> \n<p>But when it comes to eating animals, Portman promotes a less finger-wagging approach and a more awareness-raising agenda. “From the beginning, we talked about how to make this something people want to see and not just showing cruelty,” she said.</p> \n<p>More relatable data was carefully chosen to appear in the narrated track of the documentary, at one point explaining how genetically enhanced chickens would be the equivalent of a 2-month-old human baby weighing 600 pounds (272 kilograms).</p> \n<p>“The meat industry has done a good job of disconnecting eating meat from killing animals. When you eat meat, an animal has been murdered,” Portman explains in the film.</p> \n<p>Obviously, Portman admits, it’s not sustainable to raise animals in a traditional, humane way and still supply the huge demand for meat. So she’s advocating a reduction of consumption and doesn’t necessarily call on everyone to go vegan.</p> \n<p>“It’s unlikely that people will completely change the way they live or take on a food identity,” she said. “I think if everyone will try to once a day eat a vegan meal or once a week go vegan, that makes a huge difference.”</p> \n<p>But the issue also has much to do with availability. Portman tells the story of screening the movie in Denver schools, where the students say they’re aware of the problem and want to eat different, but in their immediate vicinity the options are almost exclusively fast-food and meat heavy.</p> \n<p>“They were saying ‘we are in food deserts in these cities,’ so there is also this elitism of saying ‘go to your farmers’ market and buy the nice eggs from the farmer.’ Most people are like ‘yeah, that doesn’t exist where I live,’” she said.</p> \n<p>As one of the leaders of the Time’s Up group, which battles sexual harassment in the workplace, Portman is a staunch supporter of mass movements. She believes that the animal-cruelty solution, too, will sprout from a consumer-driven consciousness combined with an industry willing to listen and serve.</p> \n<p>“The education and culture change that is happening needs to be met with supply and availability and accessibility of these foods,” she said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Some 150 Afula residents, including former Mayor Avi Alkabetz, who is running for the position again, and Acting Mayor Shlomo Malihi, demonstrated Wednesday against the sale of a home in the city to an Arab family. “The residents of Afula don’t want a mixed city, but rather a Jewish city, and it’s their right,” explained Elkabetz, adding, “That’s not racism.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>If that isn’t racism, then what is? In Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel, which translated the Zionist vision of a national home for the Jewish people into an ultranationalist project of Jewish supremacy, it is easy to get confused. Racism and ethnic superiority have acquired legitimacy, and Netanyahu and his fellow cabinet members promote racist laws whose sole purpose is to give this superiority the force of law. Theoretically, if we’re talking about the kind of Jewish state the right talks about, why resist Afula’s desire to be a Jewish city?</p> \n<p>As long as such racist behavior gets by without provoking determined opposition, public condemnation and vocal criticism, it will increase and become legitimate and transparent. The opposition to the right-wing government has an important role to play here. It must draw red lines and mold the public discussion&nbsp; in accordance with its worldview. Why weren’t Zionist Union Chairman Avi Gabbay, Meretz Chairwoman Tamar Zandberg and even Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid in Afula leading an anti-racism counterdemonstration? Why didn’t they express support for the sale of the home to an Arab family?</p> \n<p>This is a critical ethical question with far-reaching political implications. The right, as it is reflected in the most ultranationalist government in Israel’s history, draws its power in part from a blatantly racist, anti-Arab base. Netanyahu himself appealed to his potential voters in the last election by warning that “Arabs are coming to the polls in droves.”</p> \n<p>The left must recognize that its main purpose is to erase racism and represent a sane, enlightened alternative to the moral darkness into which Netanyahu is leading Israel. Otherwise the left will never be reawakened and it will be wiped off the political map.</p> \n<p>Israel expects foreign governments to take expressions of anti-Semitism within their borders seriously and to publicly denounce it. In Israel, in contrast, expressions of hatred for Arabs are met with total indifference at best or encouragement at worst. To our great shame, we cannot expect the government to denounce such ugly behavior, since the right itself spreads hatred and racism and benefits from them in elections. But if the protest in Afula failed to bring opposition leaders, who claim to champion equality and human dignity, to the streets, then who needs them?</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s very easy, and totally appropriate, to be appalled by the reports of demonstrations in Afula against the sale of a house there to an Arab family. How could anyone not be horrified by such overt racism, by statements like “As soon as one comes, they’ll spring up like mushrooms after the rain,” as one resident put it? Unpleasant analogies come immediately to mind.</p> \n<p>At the same time, one must ask: What’s so special about the racist protesters in Afula? Isn’t the entire country strewn with places — kibbutzim, cooperative communities and the like — that practice the very same discrimination and refuse to open their doors to Arabs (among others)?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'They told me I couldn't enter': Israeli public pool separates Bedouin from Jews</p> \n<p>Sure, they do this much more elegantly than the Afula protesters. They don’t stand in the streets shouting “enemies of Israel!” Instead, they establish admission committees, which meet in air-conditioned rooms and, presumably very politely, choose (we won’t call it “selektzia,” why get in trouble?) who is appropriate and who is not, who is “one of us” and who should stay with his own kind.</p> \n<p>Do those who are justifiably outraged over the Afula protests and the racism they expressed cry out and write impassioned op-eds when another Arab, or Mizrahi Jew, or gay couple, or head of a single-parent household is rejected by some admission committee (assuming they were optimistic enough to apply in the first place)? Do they protest with the same intensity against the government’s biased land allocation policies, which put Palestinian citizens at the very bottom of the ladder and many Mizrahim just a little bit higher?</p> \n<p>For example, you probably won’t see residents of Kfar Vradim congregating in the street and brandishing racist signs. Nonetheless, when it became known in March that half of the winning bidders in a sale of building lots in the northern Israeli community were Arabs, the local council suspended the sale in order to preserve the town’s “secular-Jewish-Zionist character.” Arabs aren’t the only ones who aren’t wanted there. Ultra-Orthodox Jews were turned away previously.</p> \n<p>And does anyone still think the High Court of Justice, which authorizes many of the injustices of the occupation, will stem the racist tide? Don’t forget that in 2014, the court rejected petitions against the “admission committee law,” which permits the use of criteria such as “incompatibility with the community’s sociocultural fabric” to deny admission to cooperative communities.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israelis who like Arabs, but not as neighbors&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>It isn’t only small communities that are specifying the groups that are undesirable: In Zichron Yaakov, much fuss is being made over a planned halfway house for people in recovery from drug abuse. Some residents who vehemently oppose the plan are holding protests.</p> \n<p>Granted, the hypocritical pseudo-left isn’t the biggest problem in Israel today. But why is it so annoying? And why is it so important to give it a shake and expose the lie at the basis of its self-perception? First, because of its excessive pretension. Second, and more important: As long as the false and arbitrary separation persists in many people’s minds between the good, clean and just (and white) left on one hand, and the ugly and racist (and brown) right on the other, nothing will change.</p> \n<p>Those who ask themselves why it is that so many Israelis continue to hate, and to hate “the left” all the more, even though the right has been in power for decades, may find at least a partial answer here.</p>",

        "text":["<p>ANTALYA, Turkey – Tourists in this resort city were surprised last week when they googled for “vacant rooms” in the area: The top-sponsored result wasn’t for a glamorous new hotel, but rather a campaign ad from an opposition party promising there will be plenty of rooms available if President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is booted from office.</p> \n<p>The tongue-in-cheek ad by the Good Party (iYi Party) – which is running against Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) in presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday June 24 – was referencing the lavish 1,100-room Ak Saray (“White Palace”) that the Turkish president built for himself in Ankara, at a cost of some $650 million, in 2014.</p> \n<p>The online ad was just one example of how opposition parties in Turkey are creatively using online marketing strategies and social media to try to get around Erdogan’s tight grip on mainstream media, which critics say has grown even stronger ahead of the snap elections this month.</p> \n<p>A search for “VPN” – the system many Turks use to get around the government’s internet restrictions – was met with another message from the Good Party: “Don’t waste your money, wait until we are in power to enjoy internet freedom.”</p> \n<p>With over 175,000 websites already banned in Turkey (including Wikipedia) and some 800 Twitter accounts blocked, Erdogan recently moved to secure greater control of the internet with a new law that would require many media outlets to seek a license to broadcast online.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Selahattin Demirtas, the imprisoned presidential candidate for the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), decided to use the biweekly phone call he is allowed with his wife to deliver a campaign speech instead. Demirtas has been detained since November 2016, on terrorism charges largely based on claims that he was involved in the activities of the PKK – the militant Kurdish group involved in a long-standing struggle with the Turkish army.</p> \n<p>The 45-year-old human rights lawyer, who denies all charges, had been the main hope for anti-Erdogan progressives in Turkey in the last few years. However, he was jailed alongside a dozen MPs from his party amid a crackdown on the opposition following the attempted coup of July 2016.</p> \n<p>“Every day while my hands are tied, the government officials, without pause, continue the smear campaigns against me in the newspapers and on TV. While I can’t even use my right to respond, they continue their political ruse by making all kinds of fabricated allegations,” Demirtas said in the video recording of his phone call, which was then distributed on social media by the HDP.</p> \n<p>Last week, Demirtas also held an online news conference of sorts. Questions were sent to him via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, with hashtags such as #AskDemirtas and posed to him by his lawyers, who then shared his responses on social media.</p> \n<p>Erdogan’s main challenger is ex-physics teacher Muharrem Ince, who is the presidential candidate for the Republican People’s Party (CHP) – the party created by Mustafa Kemal Atat&uuml;rk, the founder of modern Turkey.</p> \n<p>Ince is also struggling with limited access to coverage in the country’s largely pro-Erdogan media, though to a slightly lesser degree than other opposition candidates. This is reflected, among other things, in his frantic campaign schedule, which often includes two or three rallies in different cities in a single day.</p> \n<p>Ince was also quick to pick up on a Twitter campaign against Erdogan in May that started spontaneously on social media after the president declared he would step aside if he was to lose the elections. “If one day our nation says ‘enough,’ then we will step aside,” he said, using the Turkish word “tamam,” which can translate as “OK” or “enough.”</p> \n<p>When the hashtag #tamam went viral in opposition circles online, with millions suggesting they had indeed had “enough,” Ince and his party took up the slogan in an attempt to reach voters.</p> \n<p>Ince slammed Turkey’s “pathetic” television industry in an interview with the Financial Times (“Erdogan opponent warns of Turkey’s ‘society of fear’”), complaining that TV stations often cut short his rallies but give full coverage to Erdogan’s events, thus making his on-the-ground campaigning less effective.</p> \n<p>Jane Louise Kandur, a columnist for the pro-government Daily Sabah and former head of the AKP’s women’s branch in Istanbul, dismissed such complaints as groundless.</p> \n<p>“There is a perception that Erdogan is given more airtime – which is backed up by the fact that Erdogan is president, so he is more likely to be in the news. But statistics show the distribution of airtime allocated to the campaigns is actually fair,” she told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>At a conference held by the European Parliament last month to mark World Press Freedom Day, Turkish journalists warned that with the recent sale of the Dogan Media Group – one of the largest media conglomerates in the country – around 92 percent of the entire media landscape is now under direct control of the government.</p> \n<p>Dogan was considered the last part of Turkey’s mainstream media to have a degree of autonomy from the government. However, it was bought by Erdogan Demir&ouml;ren, an entrepreneur close to Erdogan, for $1.2 billion at the end of March and renamed Demir&ouml;ren Media Group. A few weeks later, the president revealed his decision to call snap elections. This is seen as an attempt to head off a looming economic crisis and to secure the presidency until 2023, when Turkey celebrates 100 years from Atat&uuml;rk’s establishment of the Republic.</p> \n<p>Demir&ouml;ren died last Friday and the media group is now being controlled by his son, Yildirim Demir&ouml;ren, who previously held the position of vice chairman in the organization. The conglomerate owns the prominent newspapers H&uuml;rriyet and Posta (Turkey’s first- and fourth-biggest circulation dailies), the Dogan News Agency, as well as the TV entertainment and news channels Kanal D and CNN T&uuml;rk, and other smaller outlets.</p> \n<p>In 2009, a $2.5 billion fine for unpaid taxes (later lowered to $700 million on appeal) had already forced the secular-leaning previous owner, Aydin Dogan, to soften the group’s editorial line on Erdogan’s party in order to stay afloat – according to observers who saw the penalty as politically motivated. In 2013, CNN T&uuml;rk famously aired a documentary on penguins as the Gezi Park protests against Erdogan were taking place, drawing widespread criticism from the opposition.</p> \n<p>Yavuz Baydar, a Turkish journalist who lives in exile from Turkey, said at the Brussels conference that “90 percent of the Turkish public gets its news from TV” and that, after the sale of Dogan Media, “there is only one noteworthy opposition channel left: Halk TV.”</p> \n<p>This means that journalists who are critical of the government can reach urban youth through news websites, but have “little hope” of reaching the majority of voters, he added.</p> \n<p>At the same conference, the Istanbul-based Turkish correspondent of The Economist, Piotr Zalewski, pointed out how the lack of media freedom is a long-standing issue for Turkey, since well before Erdogan came to power.</p> \n<p>“What needs to happen down the line is a change in the media culture that has flourished under Erdogan and the AKP, but predates them by decades. It a culture that allows no room for investigative journalism; a culture where dissidents and opponents of one group or another are tried and convicted in newspapers before they are tried in courts, where columnists act as brokers of political influence,” he said.</p> \n<p>With an economic downturn threatening Erdogan’s popularity ahead of the early election, the president is relying heavily on positive media coverage to de-emphasize his government’s faults. The currency crisis, which has seen the Turkish lira plummet in the last few months to record lows against the dollar, is attributed by pro-government outlets to a vaguely defined “high interest rate lobby” – whom Erdogan has even accused of being guilty of treason.</p> \n<p>These reports never refer to the fall of the lira, but rather to the “hike” of the dollar against it. They also ignore the insights of many analysts who warn that Erdogan’s obsession with low interest rates as a way of boosting the economy has led to unwise choices by the central bank.</p> \n<p>If Erdogan wins on June 24, he will also enjoy greater powers following a referendum on the presidential system in April 2017. Yet while many joke that the lira is the only real opposition to Erdogan left in Turkey, his opponents have been making some inroads.</p> \n<p>According to a poll reported by Reuters last week, Erdogan may be forced to face a second round in the presidential election (he would need to secure over 50 percent of the vote in the first round to avoid a runoff). The poll also suggests his party could lose its overall parliamentary majority. The poll figures also suggest HDP leader Demirtas may secure enough votes to enter parliament, even though he will still be stuck behind bars.</p>",

However, after a mix-up at the Egypt-Israel border, the band ends up in Bet Hatikva, a one-horse town in the middle of the desert – a place where what passes for life centers around the caf&eacute; owned by Dina (Katrina Lenk).</p> \n<p>Here’s what you need to know about the hit musical...</p> \n<p>1 Contrary to some reports, the original movie – which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 – is not based on a true story.</p> \n<p>The film’s writer-director, Eran Kolirin, told Indiewire in 2008 that he was reading a travel book in which the author related how he came to Israel by car for the first time and, becoming stressed and disoriented, ended up in the small city of Netanya instead of Tel Aviv. “Because of this mistake, he describes the conversation he has with a girl at the information desk at the hotel. That’s what inspired the movie,” Kolirin explained.</p> \n<p>Kolirin also told the Washington Post that the story developed out of a vision he had of a man in a police uniform who sings.</p> \n<p>Although the film won a top award at Cannes and eight Israeli Oscars (including best film and best music, for Habib Shadah’s lovely score), it was denied the chance to compete at the 2008 Academy Awards in the best foreign language film category – it was deemed to have too much dialogue in English.</p> \n<p>The original comedy-drama (known as “Bikur Hatizmoret” in Hebrew) starred Ronit Elkabetz as Dina and Sasson Gabai as Egyptian band leader Lt. Col. Tawfiq Zacharya. Tragically, Elkabetz died from cancer at age 51 in April 2016. But in a lovely touch that brings things full circle, Gabai is to reprise his film role on Broadway later this month. The 70-year-old, Iraq-born actor will replace Tony Shalhoub, starting June 26.</p> \n<p>2 When producer Orin Wolf saw Kolirin’s movie at the Other Israel Film Festival in New York in 2007, he turned to his wife when the end credits rolled and said “This has gotta be staged,” according to Broadway News.</p> \n<p>The first public reading of “The Band’s Visit” took place in Hartford, Connecticut, in 2010 – though this was basically just a read through of the film’s screenplay. It would be five years before book writer Itamar Moses and composer David Yazbek came on board. (Theater legend Hal Prince was originally set to direct the show, but had to drop out due to a scheduling conflict.)</p> \n<p>3 Yazbek, 57, grew up on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with a Maronite Arab father from Lebanon and a half-Jewish, half-Italian mother. Able to play several Arab instruments – including the darbuka (a goblet-shaped drum) and the pear-shaped oud – he told the New York Times last November he was also perfectly qualified to translate “the sound of Israeli sarcasm.”</p> \n<p>Yazbek’s previous Broadway hits include the musical adaptations of several other films, including “The Full Monty” and “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels” (another adaptation, “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” was less successful).</p> \n<p>Berkeley-born Moses, 41 this year, is a Jewish-American playwright whose parents moved to California from Israel. He is best-known for the 2011 play “Completeness” and an alleged literary feud with novelist Jonathan Safran Foer that was said to be the source of Moses’ 2007 play “The Four of Us.”</p> \n<p>Moses may be as apt a name as possible for a story about people coming from Egypt and getting stranded in the Israeli desert, but the writer was initially reluctant to work on &quot;Visit,&quot; as it would be his third musical in a row. The reason he offered to Theater Mania for his reluctance can now been be seen in an ironic light. &quot;Musicals are so hard and the ecosystem is such that you end up feeling that if it didn't move to Broadway and win everything, you failed,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Yazbek and Moses have both been at pains to explain that their show, like the film, is not about the tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors. “This could be about any two groups, even Democrats and Republicans,” Yazbek told NPR last year.</p> \n<p>4 With its Middle Eastern-inspired sounds, the musical is unusual by Broadway standards – especially as it lacks the big showstopper tunes commonly associated with the Great White Way.</p> \n<p>Yazbek has explained that he used Arabic instruments from the very beginning. “If you’re writing for an oud, then there are certain things that are gonna happen — it’s a fretless instrument, so those chord progressions might be something you’d hear a contemporary Israeli or Arabic songwriter using,” he has said.</p> \n<p>It is not only the music that’s drawn from the region. Sound designer Kai Harada (also a Tony Award winner Sunday night) told Backstage he did a “fair amount of research” to ensure that the background noises were also right for the Israeli desert – which meant studying the sound of the wind and the chirping of crickets.</p> \n<p>5 No matter how charming the storyline, all musicals live or die on the strength of their music – and “The Band’s Visit” has wowed critics with songs that successfully balance heartfelt emotion and sharp humor.</p> \n<p>The score includes “Welcome to Nowhere” (“Stick a pin in a map of the desert. / Build a road to the middle of the desert. / Pour concrete on the spot in the desert. / That’s Bet Hatikva”), “Haled’s Song About Love,” “Answer Me” and the closest thing the musical has to an actual “showstopper,” “Omar Sharif.”</p> \n<p>Yet that song – in which caf&eacute; owner Dina (played by Katrina Lenk) sings of an Israeli childhood spent watching Egyptian movies on a Friday evening, falling under the spell of the actor Omar Sharif and legendary Egyptian singer-actor Umm Kulthum – was actually dropped from the musical for a spell during the development stage.</p> \n<p>Yazbek told New York magazine the song was cut for at least six months as they were working on the musical, much to his discomfort (“I was thinking this might be one of the best songs I’ve ever written”). Luckily for him and audiences, when David Cromer came onboard as director, he wanted to hear all of the songs that had been cut – giving the composer a chance to argue for the reintroduction of the “cafeteria song.”</p> \n<p>6 Critics took “The Band’s Visit” to their hearts immediately. The initial Off Broadway show at the Atlantic Theatre won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award for best musical in 2016, and the same prize from the Outer Critics Circle Awards.</p> \n<p>The New York Times called the Broadway production “a rarity seldom found these days outside of the canon of Stephen Sondheim: an honest-to-God musical for grown-ups,” while the Chicago Tribune labeled it “remarkable and boundlessly compassionate.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, Jewish magazine Tablet called it “terrific.”</p> \n<p>7 The cast includes many actors of Middle Eastern origin. Shalhoub is of Lebanese descent, while his replacement when he was filming season two of “The Amazing Mrs. Maisel” recently, Dariush Kashani, was born in Tehran. George Abud (Camal) is Lebanese-American, while Ari’el Stachel (Haled) is of Yemenite descent. Sharone Sayegh (Anna) is of Iraqi-Israeli descent, while Adam Kantor went from playing Motel Kamzoil in “Fiddler on the Roof” to Telephone Guy in “The Band’s Visit.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, Stachel provided the Tony Awards ceremony with one of its most memorable moments in his acceptance speech, in which he echoed recent comments he made in Time magazine about how “The Band’s Visit” had allowed him to come to terms with being Middle Eastern.</p> \n<p>On Sunday night, in a teary speech, he said: “I am part of a cast of actors who never believed they would be able to portray their own races, and we are doing that. And not only that, we are getting messages from kids all over the Middle East thanking us and telling us how transformative our representation is for them.”</p> \n<p>As yet, there are no confirmed plans for an Israeli version of the musical. Still, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, perhaps they should avoid holding the premiere in Petah Tikva.</p>",

Traditionally, those observing the Sabbath do not travel in cars... but that would have meant they would not be able to attend any of Friday's balls or the events on the following day -- which for a couple who wanted to be part of everything, was not an option. Walking was out of the question; their detail told them it was not safe, given the vitriol and the protests.

Christie himself had not totally put it behind him, particularly months later, long after Jared had a hand in firing him from his role, and reports of Jared’s meetings with Russian officials and involvement in the firing of FBI Director James Comey caught the attention of investigations in the Robert Mueller probe. Good thing I saved his father’s prison number, Christie would joke with friends.”  CHAPTER 7 IS TITLED 'BASHERT' --&nbsp;“It's Bashert.&quot; &quot;They’re bashert.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;Bashert.&quot;&nbsp;Their friends and colleagues and associates separately repeated the same Hebrew word when asked why Ivanka and Jared Kushner settle into one another. The world roughly translated into something being preordained, fated, inevitable, and in the case of a romantic match, a soul mate... They are blindly loyal to their families and hell-bent on expanding their empires.”  THE CONVERSION --&nbsp;“Ivanka agreed to convert, though she claimed that she didn’t have that far to go: “I’m a New Yorker. I’m in real estate. I’m as close to Jewish with an ‘i-s-h’ naturally as anyone can start off.” [Page 223]  VIEW FROM THE YESHIVA LEAGUE --&nbsp;“Some people in the Trump-Kushners’ community -- KJ members, Ramaz parents, people who went to the modern Orthodox yeshiva school that Jared attended in Paramus, New Jersey - thought it was a BFD to have one of their own become a BFD. On Saturday mornings throughout the campaign, as the rabbis spoke or cantors chanted, congregants would whisper that it was somewhat of a comfort to have him in the candidate’s ear Many agreed, however, that if they had their druthers, and it was up to them to choose a guy in their community who would be the one so close to and advising a U.S. presidential candidate, Jared would not have ranked high on their list.”  “In terms of his relationship with Jewish community leaders beyond his own New York, New Jersey bubble,&nbsp;many influential members corresponded with Kushner often, voicing their concerns and urging him to push certain policy positions...&nbsp;Jewish organizations could tell that Kushner was overwhelmed and overworked... so Jared frequently relied on feedback and input from these organizations, though it was clear he barely had time to do so. &quot;He'd reply to emails with letters instead of words, always very short, almost like he was running around on a Blackberry with one hand tied,&quot; one Zionist organization leader recalled.&quot; [Page 53]&nbsp;  ADAM ENTOUS' LATEST&nbsp;-- How Trump and Three Other U.S. Presidents Protected Israel’s Worst-Kept Secret: Its Nuclear Arsenal:&nbsp;&quot;When&nbsp;a delegation of senior Israeli officials visited the Trump White House on February 13, 2017, they wanted to discuss... a secret letter concerning a subject the Israelis had promised the Americans never to discuss publicly—Israel’s undeclared nuclear arsenal... Only a select group of senior American officials, in three previous Administrations, knew of the letters and how Israeli leaders interpreted them as effectively an American pledge not to press the Jewish state to give up its nuclear weapons so long as it continued to face existential threats in the region. (American officials say the letters weren’t that explicit and fell short of constituting a binding commitment.)&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;When Trump’s aides moved into the White House, they didn’t find any copies of the previous letters left behind by their predecessors. The documents had been sent to the archives. The Israelis, however, had copies...&nbsp;So when Ambassador [Ron] Dermer came to the White House to talk to Michael Flynn about arranging for Trump to sign the letter, Trump’s aides were confused and, initially, said that they needed more time. U.S. officials said that the Israelis wanted to limit who could take part in discussions of the letter, citing the need for secrecy. The Americans pushed back. Afterward, senior White House officials huddled together and complained to each other that Dermer had acted as though he owned the White House...&quot;&nbsp;[NewYorker]  DRIVING THE CONVO -- Attorney General&nbsp;Jeff&nbsp;Sessions responds to Nazi comparisons:&nbsp;&quot;Sessions&nbsp;on Monday&nbsp;defended the Trump administration’s practice of separating parents and children who cross the border illegally from comparisons to the concentration camps of Nazi Germany...&nbsp;“Well, it’s a real exaggeration. Of course in Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country,” Sessions said.&quot;&nbsp;[TheHill;&nbsp;HuffPost]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- CNN host Wolf Blitzer&nbsp;challenged&nbsp;former CIA Director Michael&nbsp;Hayden for&nbsp;comparing&nbsp;the Trump administration's practice of separating children from their families at the border&nbsp;to the Holocaust on CNN's Situation Room:&nbsp;“You understand the controversy that any comparison to the Holocaust, yes, the kids were brought on the trains, to Birkenau which was at Auschwitz. I speak with some authority on this. My grandparents were murdered at Auschwitz. My dad survived, but two of his brothers and two of his sisters were killed. They were separated. They weren’t separated to go to some other facility. They were separated to die. They were killed. When you make the comparison to Auschwitz, that’s a powerful image.”  Hayden:&nbsp;“I fully understand, and if I offended anyone they have my deepest and most sincere apologies. But what&nbsp;I was trying to describe was that these things that we take for granted shouldn't be taken for granted... I knew it would be controversial, but I felt a warning flare was necessary.&quot;&nbsp;[Video]&nbsp;  Harvard Law professor&nbsp;Alan Dershowitz writes...&nbsp;&quot;The image of a child being taken out of the arms of its mother cannot help but generate an emotional reaction... Some opponents of the policy compare it to the Holocaust, equating detention centers with concentration and death camps.&nbsp;Though well-intentioned, this comparison is a form of Holocaust denial, because it makes it seem that the Jews suffered no fate worse than those currently suffered by the children being temporarily removed from their parents.&quot;&nbsp;[FoxNews]&nbsp;  Dershowitz made a direct appeal to Trump on&nbsp;Fox &amp; Friends: ‘I Implore You to Stop’ Migrant Policy Now&nbsp;[Mediaite]  John Podhoretz&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Stop already with the Nazi and Hitler analogies. Really. Stop.

As a conservative teen growing up in Santa Monica, he wrote op-eds comparing his liberal classmates to terrorists and musing that Osama bin Laden would fit in at his high school. In college, he coordinated an “Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week.” These efforts were not calibrated for persuasion; they were designed to agitate. And now that he’s in the White House, he is deploying similar tactics.&quot;[TheAtlantic]  TODAY ON THE HILL -- House Democrats Are Unveiling a Bill to Keep Immigrant Families Together -- by Alana Abramson: “Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is introducing the Keep Families Together Act on Tuesday, the lower chamber’s companion to a bill Democratic Sen.

It is taking advantage of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s head being wrapped up in the FIFA World Cup, with Russia playing host, and therefore wanting peace and quiet, which is what Israel and Trump’s administration are closely coordinating In the background are persistent reports about a scheme involving Washington, Moscow and Israel. Accordingly, Trump demanded that the Europeans readmit Russia to the G-7 forum of highly industrialized nations, because the Russians had agreed in general to Israel’s request to distance Iran from its borders.”&nbsp;[Al-Monitor]&nbsp;  Jacob Nagel, a former&nbsp;National Security Advisor for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, writes...&nbsp;&quot;Iran, Syria, and Israel’s Red Line:&nbsp;It is highly unlikely that the rumors are true that Israel and Russia (with Syria and even maybe U.S. assistance) agreed on a deal to move Iranian forces farther from Israel’s northern border in return for Israeli acceptance of Assad’s Syrian forces returning to the border. Israel’s firm and non-negotiable request is that Iranian forces will be entirely out of Syria, and for good.&quot;[RealClearDefense]&nbsp;  Dov Zakheim writes “Trump's Perilous Path:&nbsp;Trump’s unstinting support for Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and policies... represents another potential flashpoint for more trouble in the Middle East. The president’s clear signal that his administration is not interested in entertaining Palestinian grievances may have few consequences in the short term, despite the ongoing weekly Gaza protests. Over time, however, it could prompt another far bloodier uprising by increasingly frustrated and desperate Palestinians that could force the Gulf Arabs to back away from their covert cooperation with Israel against a common Iranian threat.”&nbsp;[NationalInterest]&nbsp;  IN THE SPOTLIGHT:&nbsp;Qatar pushes back against Trump fundraiser's hacking allegations -- by&nbsp;Jenna McLaughlin:&nbsp;&quot;In two new court filings in the Central District of California, attorneys for Qatar and its lobbyist Nicolas Muzin argue that [Eliot] Broidy is on a &quot;fishing expedition&quot; for information about sensitive government business to embarrass Qatar. The attorneys argue that Broidy hasn't demonstrated sufficient evidence that Qatar orchestrated the hack and say that Qatar and its registered agents may not be subject to the California court's jurisdiction... Attorneys for Muzin and his company Stonington Strategies... said on Monday in a second filing that Broidy is engaging in a &quot;public relations stunt&quot; with the aim of damaging Muzin's reputation.

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here</p> \n<p>REPORT:&nbsp;Mike Huckabee Praised Qatar Without Revealing He Was Paid $50,000 by Qatar -- by Dan Friedman:&nbsp;&quot;On Friday,&nbsp;Joseph Allaham, a former owner of kosher steakhouses in New York, retroactively registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for Qatar. In the paperwork... Allaham noted that he had paid $50,000 on November 23, 2017, to Blue Diamond Horizons, a Florida corporation&nbsp;run&nbsp;by [Mike] Huckabee... Huckabee was an expensive get for Qatar. His trip cost more than the $50,000 payment he received from Allaham.&quot;  &quot;Dr. Joseph Frager, a&nbsp;gastroenterologist&nbsp;and pro-Israel activist who supported Huckabee’s 2016 presidential bid, last month also registered as a foreign agent for Qatar, and he reported that he was&nbsp;paid $50,000 by Muzin’s firm for Qatar-related work. Frager told&nbsp;Mother Jones&nbsp;that the fee was in part for helping facilitate Huckabee’s January visit...&nbsp;And for its $50,000, the Qatari government got a positive tweet out of him.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Allaham reported that his work for Qatar including making a $100,000 donation in October to Our Soldiers Speak, a New York-based charity that organizes trips by officers in the Israeli Defense Forces and the Israeli National Police to speak on college campuses in other countries... The contribution came on October 30, a few days before the group’s&nbsp;annual gala, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at the time the CIA director, was the keynote speaker.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Allaham also made two $50,000 contributions to [Mort] Klein’s group, the Zionist Organization of America. The first was on November 2, shortly before the group’s annual dinner. The second came on January 23, a few weeks after Klein visited Doha.&quot; [MotherJones]</p> \n<p>-- Flashback to&nbsp;Feb 26, 2018:&nbsp;&quot;ZOA and Morton Klein have no potential financial motive or ulterior purpose here. ZOA and Mr. Klein’s preparation time and effort, and the time Mr. Klein spent on his exhausting 13 hour trip each way to and from Qatar, cost us staff money.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mort Klein told us by phone&nbsp;this morning “We are now looking into it thoroughly. In the next 24 to 48 hours, if we determine that this money clearly came from Qatar, we will return the money immediately. Any money that the ZOA has received for the past 25 years has come from private individuals, never from any country. To this minute, my complete understanding was that it came from a private individual. If I thought that any money came from Qatar, I would never have accepted it.&quot;  &quot;I assumed this was a wealthy businessman (Joseph Allaham) who was giving ZOA a check. I’ve had many wealthy business people who have given me 100k&nbsp;and plus. That happens all the time. And I knew that Allaham brought&nbsp;Malcolm Hoenlein, Alan Dershowitz and Mike Huckabee to Qatar. In my eyes this made him look like a legitimate individual. To me, them going, koshered the trip. I never did a thing for Qatar. Whatever money I got -- whether it is from Qatar or not -- I never did anything for them. I never wrote an article praising them, I never lobbied for them.”  &quot;My whole trip was wall-to-wall meetings with officials from Qatar. Al Jazeera was going to release a four&nbsp;part series called The Israel Lobby, which would have increased anti-Semitism in America and hatred towards Israel. That was a horrible documentary, and I urged them to kill this. And because of my work it never aired. This was a big achievement of my going to Qatar. It’s not like I went there and went to the beach...&nbsp;Qatar asked me a month ago to come back. They wanted to set up meetings with top officials at Al Jazeera, but I rejected this because too many people thought that I shouldn't have gone to Qatar in the first place.&quot;  HEADLINE DEPT: &quot;Saudi Moves Forward With Plan to Turn Qatar Into Island&quot; [Bloomberg]  DRIVING THE CONVO --&nbsp;As was previously&nbsp;anticipated, the&nbsp;U.S. announced&nbsp;its withdrawal yesterday&nbsp;from the U.N. Human Rights Council.&nbsp;&quot;For too long, the Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias,&quot; Ambassador to the UN, Nikki&nbsp;Haley said in a joint appearance&nbsp;with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the State Department on Tuesday.&nbsp;&quot;The council’s continued and well-documented bias against Israel is unconscionable. Since its creation, the council has adopted more resolutions condemning Israel than against the rest of the world combined,&quot; Pompeo added.  Israel's&nbsp;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the U.S. move as a&nbsp;“courageous decision against the hypocrisy and the lies” of “a biased, hostile, anti-Israel organization that has betrayed its mission of protecting human rights.”  REACTION --&nbsp;Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized the move&nbsp;in a statement: &quot;By withdrawing from the council, we lose our leverage and allow the council's bad actors to follow their worst impulses unchecked — including running roughshod over Israel.&quot;&nbsp;  Elliott Abrams, a former Republican diplomat and now a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the Human Rights Council’s bias against Israel was too much to ignore. “There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,” Mr. Abrams said. “But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.” [NYTimes]  Dore Gold, former Director General of Israel's Foreign Ministry, emails us...&nbsp;&quot;The UN Human Rights Council was founded on the basis of noble ideals but in recent decades it evolved into a body that violated the most important legal principle for any legal body: equality before the law. It discriminated against the State of Israel and avoided criticism of states engaging in crimes against humanity. America had no veto power there to halt this deterioration.&nbsp;I will never forget its sponsorship of the Goldstone Report alleging that the IDF deliberately killed Palestinian civilians. Goldstone, whom I debated, later renounced this modern blood libel, but it undoubtedly contributed to new anti-Semitic outbursts in the world community.&quot;&nbsp;  HOW IT PLAYED:&nbsp;&quot;The announcement comes just a day after the U.N.'s top human rights official, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, criticized the Trump administration's &quot;zero tolerance&quot; immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents at the border.&quot; [NBC; Bloomberg]  WHAT'S NEXT?&nbsp;“The council is scheduled to discuss Israel and the Palestinian territories on July 2, according to its agenda.” [Bloomberg]&nbsp;  MEANWHILE --&nbsp;Dozens of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel, which quickly retaliates -- by Noga Tarnopolsky: &quot;Sirens rang out throughout the night in southern Israel early Wednesday as 45 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip, Israeli authorities said.&nbsp;In response, the Israeli military struck the strip, aiming at 25 targets it said were associated with Hamas, the militia that governs the Palestinian territory.&quot; [LATimes]  &quot;Democratic Megadonor Haim Saban Attacks Senators for Urging Humanitarian Aid to Gaza Strip&quot; -- by Alex Emmons: “Saban emailed the senators, some at their personal addresses, to directly express his displeasure with a letter organized last month by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt calling for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “act urgently in order to help relieve the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.”... “Senators, for you to listen to Senator Sanders and accuse Israel of being the main culprit is outrageous, misinformed, offensive and shows a lack of understanding of the region’s basic fundamentals,” Saban wrote. “Do your homework, unless you have chosen to blindly follow Senator Sanders' ill advised, misinformed, simplistic, and ignorant lead.” [TheIntercept]  TALK OF THE MIDDLE EAST --&nbsp;Jordan's king tells Kushner: Mideast peace requires two state solution -- by Barak Ravid:&nbsp;&quot;According to a statement from the Jordanian royal court,&nbsp;King Abdullah told [Jared] Kushner and [Jason] Greenblatt... the peace talks must be re-launched between Israel and the Palestinians on the basis of the 2 state solution and the Arab peace initiative.&quot; [Axios]  Former Ambassador Daniel Shapiro tells us...&nbsp;&quot;Kushner and Greenblatt's visits to the Arab states could be largely about drumming up support for a major initiative to address the humanitarian disaster in Gaza while maintaining pressure on Hamas.&nbsp;That would make sense.&nbsp;But if they were to lay the groundwork for the release of a peace plan intended to bring the parties to the table, that faces much steeper odds.&quot;  &quot;With the United States unable to engage directly with the Palestinians after the Jerusalem decision, and with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders facing domestic political constraints that rule out compromise, any U.S. plan is likely to be dead on arrival with one or both sides.&nbsp;The idea that the Arab states could rescue a plan presented in such unfavorable circumstances, or would stick their necks out to try if it looks unacceptable to the Palestinians, seems far-fetched.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>PLO Executive Committee member Jibril Rajoub to i24News:&nbsp;“[Kushner] can come and leave, but believe me nothing will change on the ground. Kushner, Mushner has to recharge the batteries and recognize the reality that we are under occupation.” [Video]&nbsp;  THE TRUMP EFFECT -- Settler housing construction drops to six-year low under Trump -- by Tovah Lazaroff:&nbsp;“From January to March of this year, ground was broken on only 250 settler housing starts, according to data released Tuesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics. It’s the lowest recorded number in any single quarter since 2012” [JPost]&nbsp;  Religious Leaders Condemn Family Separations—but Not Necessarily Trump -- by Emma Green:&nbsp;&quot;Many of the groups that have been most vocal against the border policy are already outspoken Trump skeptics. Among the ranks of Trump’s closest allies... the condemnation has been more tempered...&nbsp;For some groups, the choice to speak out is a major shift: The Orthodox Union, which represents many Modern Orthodox Jewish congregations in the U.S., honored Sessions as the keynote speaker at its annual conference last week.

        "text":["<p>When a public commission decided back in 1987 that moderate physical pressure should be able to be used as a last resort in interrogating terrorism suspects, it apparently never expected that the techniques might be used against Jews. It turns out that these exceptional measures – which are considered legitimate, legally and socially, because they are aimed at the “other,” the enemy – are also being used, albeit to a very limited extent, against Jews.</p> \n<p>The widespread view that there is no problem sacrificing other people’s bodily integrity, freedom and dignity for the sake of our lives and security has proven to be somwhat simplistic. The distinction between us and others isn’t dichotomous. What we allow to be done to others in our names and for our sake is liable to backfire on us.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the 1987 report from the Landau Commission, a three-person panel headed by former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau, permissible exceptional means cannot involve cruel, humiliating or inhumane treatment. The exceptional means should therefore not lead to confessions made after they are resorted to being excluded as evidence in court. In a landmark High Court of Justice case about torture in 1999, the state even had the gall to argue that these exceptional means do not cause pain and suffering to the suspect under interrogation.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, the Central District Court’s ruling on Tuesday against the admissibility of the defendants’ confessions in the Duma murder case is an important step towards truth and justice. In their ruling, the judges called the use of physical pressure “a serious violation of defendants’ fundamental right to maintain the integrity of body and soul,” and of their dignity. This violation is so severe, the court said, that it is not necessary to investigate the degree to which these tactics actually influenced the suspects’ free will. Their confessions must be inadmissible as evidence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The district court’s approach bolsters human rights organizations’ grievances against prosecutors and the Supreme Court for failing to be moved in cases in which interrogators admit to using such tactics out of “necessity.” The police rarely look into such cases. But there ought to at least be inquiries into what exactly was done and what the justification was for using physical pressure. That would provide a basis for deciding what the consequences should be, for both the suspect and the interrogator, as a result of what happened during the interrogation.</p> \n<p>The Central District Court ruling also concludes that excluding confessions extracted under pressure as evidence isn’t the end of the story. If additional confessions were subsequently obtained under conditions in which the suspect did exercise free will, they are admissible. That was the case when it comes to Amiram Ben-Uliel, one of three defendants in the case of the Duma murders&nbsp;in which three members of the Palestinian Dawabsheh family were killed in a 2015 arson attack.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, if the additional confessions are obtained in a way that links them to the previous confessions – for instance, if they were given right after one another or to the same interrogators – they will be disqualified. That was true when it comes to a juvenile defendant in the Duma case. For interrogators, the knowledge that they could obtain later confessions that would be admissible even if the original confessions are disqualified would be an incentive to use unacceptable tactics.</p> \n<p>The court ruling reveals that video footage of the interrogation of Ben-Uliel helped the prosecution secure the use&nbsp;&nbsp;of his&nbsp; additional confessions as evidence in court, while the lack of such footage hurt the prosecution's case with regard to the juvenile defendant's additional admissions. This raises questions about the wisdom of the Shin Bet security service’s vehement opposition to videotaping interrogations, even after former Shin Bet chief Yuval Diskin consented to the practice in his appearance before another public commission, the Turkel Commission, which looked into the circumstances of the Israel Navy's confrontation wtih a Turkish flotilla in 2010.</p> \n<p>The High Court has ruled on torture and unequivocally forbidden its use, and that of cruel, inhumane or humiliating treatment during interrogation. Nevertheless, the court said that an interrogator who uses unacceptable methods in a situation in which he believes it is necessary can raise the argument in his own defense. If the defense is accepted by a court, the exceptional circumstances will absolve the interrogator of criminal responsibility for his actions, the High Court ruled.</p> \n<p>One hopes that at least some of the justices who issued that 1999 ruling never dreamed that the narrow opening they left would lead to the institutionalization of these unacceptable methods, including acts committed on orders from on high. The degree of institutionalization is so great that the &quot;necessity&quot; defense effectively functions as a license.</p> \n<p>This is a blatant violation of international law, a violation to which senior Shin Bet officials, the attorney general, his aides and the Supreme Court are all party.</p>",

But it is time to challenge the national myth that the British were the good guys through and through.</p> \n<p>We fought the Nazis and won – but did we help the Jews? No, not really, is the answer.</p> \n<p>Challenging that myth requires us to re-evaluate, as well, the mostly forgotten years of the British Mandate in Palestine, and the Labour Party’s attitude towards Holocaust survivors. The dark years of 1945-47 are rarely discussed in Britain. Those who lived through those years are now dying one by one. Their testimonies are now being overwritten by other narratives pushing indiscriminately hostile accounts of Israel’s founding.</p> \n<p>My Catholic grandfather fought in the British Army in Palestine in the First World War and was with General Allenby when he entered the Old City of Jerusalem in 1917. He trained some of the first battalions of the Jewish Legion who fought with the British.</p> \n<p>But my left-leaning mother’s initial sympathy towards Israel turned into a passionate hatred, one fueled by much of the U.K.’s left-wing media. Even though I am married to a Jew, I shrugged her prejudices off; I tried to ignore the questions they threw up about British society as a whole, and specifically about Labour’s post-war attitude to Jews.</p> \n<p>But two years ago, I stumbled across the story of how thousands of Holocaust survivors fled Europe after the war on clandestine immigrant ships. Many had returned to their homes in Eastern Europe only, once again, to be threatened by their neighbors; they were fleeing their destroyed communities in fear of their lives. With strict immigration quotas in force in the U.S. and Britain, they felt their only hope of a future lay in Palestine. The British government thought otherwise.</p> \n<p>This wasn’t the first time Britain failed Europe’s Jews.</p> \n<p>In 1939, just when Europe’s Jews desperately needed sanctuary, Whitehall severely curtailed immigration into Palestine. While in opposition, Labour had promised to remove the restrictions, but when they won the 1945 general elections, they did not keep their word.</p> \n<p>As a result, when the survivors of the camps and ghettos tried to break through the Royal Navy blockade, they found themselves interned in detention camps, surrounded by eerily familiar watchtowers and barbed wire.</p> \n<p>Few of my friends and acquaintances in the UK had heard the story before. Why has this episode been &quot;lost&quot; from the history of the British left?</p> \n<p>According to Dave Rich, a leading expert on anti-Semitism in the U.K., the left as a whole is incapable of dealing with the Jewish experience and the memory of genocide. &quot;If you look at the standard left-wing narrative, it sees Jews before the Second World War as anti-fascists; during the war they are the victims of the worst of fascism, but after the war they are seen as fascist oppressors.&quot;</p> \n<p>Holocaust education, which has intensified in recent decades, has increased public knowledge and debate – but on the hard left that has led, ironically, to a proliferation of unsavory comparisons between Israel’s actions and those of Nazi Germany. Rich says this takes the form of “lament[ing] the failure of the Jews to learn the lessons of their own genocide.”</p> \n<p>But now it’s clear this period should become part of Britain's national discussion, and not left to those who seek to hijack history for political ends.</p> \n<p>Overlooking how successive British governments failed to respond ethically to the suffering of Jews before the Holocaust, and to its desperate survivors, has allowed the growth of distorted histories: around the idea that Israel was &quot;born in sin,&quot; that the U.K. was an exemplary sanctuary for Jewish refugees, and that Britain’s left has always exerted itself on behalf of the victims of racism and genocide.</p> \n<p>Rosie Whitehouse is a freelance journalist and is currently writing a book about Holocaust survivors’ experiences in the years immediately after the Second World War.

As the latest tumult subsides we have an opportunity to reflect on the issues that underlie these controversies. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>One lesson of the last two weeks is that people who swear they are militant opponents of anti-Semitism &quot;in all its forms&quot; too often turn out to have friends – real friends, comrades, Facebook friends&nbsp; – who are happy to spread anti-Jewish slurs or imagine the basic facts of the Holocaust are up for debate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For this reason when Labour Party leaders insist there will be no place for anti-Semites in the Party, their words don’t measure up to the problem. Too many believe they face a handful of anti-Semites, a bunch of interlopers.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;How the U.K. Labour Party's 'Zionist Problem' Started | Opinion |&nbsp;The Crisis Between Jeremy Corbyn and British Jews Has Reached Boiling Point&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;|&nbsp;Britain's pro-Palestinian Left Hasn't Solved Its Jew-baiting Problem&nbsp;| Opinion</p> \n<p>Others acknowledge the problem is more widespread but then trot out evasive phrases about &quot;unconscious anti-Semitism,&quot; or vaguely suggest we educate people to recognise anti-Semitic tropes.</p> \n<p>The problems go deeper than Labour leaders have been willing to admit. Even though we conventionally associate anti-Semitism with the right and fascism especially, the political culture of the Left has long been a source of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>A more recent development is that some avowed anti-racists are seemingly unable to recognise anti-Semitism when it stares them in the face. They dismiss it instead as a smear perpetrated by &quot;Blairites&quot; and Zionists.</p> \n<p>While the disciplinary reforms recommended by Shami Chakrabarti may help overcome these problems, the Labour Party requires more than denunciations and expulsions. It also needs reflection, education and above all leadership.</p> \n<p>A helpful place to start is the important distinction between &quot;anti-Semites&quot; and &quot;anti-Semitism.&quot;</p> \n<p>We find it at the heart of George Orwell’s writing on the subject. In October 1948 Orwell wrote to his publisher, &quot;I think [Jean-Paul] Sartre is a bag of wind and I’m going to give him a big boot.&quot; It was Sartre’s Portrait of the Anti-Semite (better known in English as Anti-Semite and Jew) which had provoked Orwell.</p> \n<p>Sartre’s book was organised around the idea that the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; was an identifiable type: bourgeois, reactionary, uncomfortable in the modern world.&nbsp; Orwell, by contrast, in his essay on &quot;Antisemitism in Britain&quot;, published in April 1945, presents a very different view.</p> \n<p>Anti-Semitism (not the anti-Semite), he insists, is present across all classes and is pervasive in British literary culture from Chaucer to Shakespeare to T.S Eliot and Aldous Huxley. Anti-Semitism, Orwell proposed, is a shared problem, not a pathology confined to a particular type.</p> \n<p>He drew a striking conclusion from this insight: &quot;The starting point for any investigation of anti-Semitism should not be ‘why does this obviously irrational belief appeal to other people?' But 'why does anti-Semitism appeal to me?'&quot;</p> \n<p>Labour politicians would do well to emulate Orwell’s honest introspection and contemplate the movement to which they have given their lives. Doing so means coming to terms not only with Jews and anti-Semitism but also capitalism and race.</p> \n<p>Anti-Semitism has been recurrent feature of radical and socialist politics in Britain from the 19th century's William Cobbett to the present day. We find it in the Chartist movement in the 1840s and in the pages of Keir Hardie’s Labour Leader, which in 1891 proclaimed that imperialist wars were being planned to suit the interests of &quot;hook-nosed Rothschilds.&quot;</p> \n<p>Jews were good when outcast, a long way away and suffering from Tsarist oppression. But many of the same socialists and radicals who protested against pogroms were first in line to pronounce the Boer War an expression of Jewish conspiracy.</p> \n<p>In failing to acknowledge this inheritance, Labour leaders disavow a painful and dishonorable aspect of the movement’s past. And as events in recent weeks have shown, these problems have not died away.</p> \n<p>Across the political spectrum protagonists continue to categorise Jews as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;. The habit is clearly visible on the Left. Here, too often, Jews find that having the &quot;correct&quot; view on Israel/Palestine and Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership is a precondition for getting a hearing on anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>A key feature of modern anti-Semitism has been the racialized projection of &quot;the Jew&quot;, an archetype which stands above and in conflict with the working class. Throughout the history of the left, certain anti-capitalist visions generated by socialists have overlapped and combined with this strain of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>What makes anti-Semitism particularly attractive and dangerous for the left is that it can appear oppositional. It provides an easy personification of oppression in the face of less tangible, global forms of domination.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;&nbsp;Why Are Corbyn's Labour and the Trump Administration Such Fertile Ground for anti-Semites?&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Labour Party Must Decide if It's a Political Home for anti-Semites or for British Jews&nbsp;| Opinion |&nbsp;British Jews Bravely Stood Up to Labour's anti-Semitism.

Yet for all the attention it received, one thing seems to have eluded almost all commentators: the mural not only depicts Jews and Jewishness, but places them in opposition to the pain and suffering of black and brown bodies.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The mural controversy illustrates the ambiguous position Jews occupy within contemporary anti-racist politics.</p> \n<p>If the left limits itself to a conception of racism which focuses solely on white privilege, it will continue to find it difficult to recognise Jews as its victims. Similarly, if European racism is understood only as a consequence of colonialism, we ignore the history of racialized exclusions within Europe itself.</p> \n<p>We need to place colonial racisms alongside anti-Semitism, and recognise how the two intersect and sometimes diverge.</p> \n<p>American scholar and Pan-Africanist W.E.B. Du Bois did just this when he came face-to-face with the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto shortly after the war. It was “particularly hard for me to learn”, said Du Bois of the rubble in Warsaw, that this &quot;was not even solely a matter of color.&quot; These reflections by Du Bois remind us today that color-coded definitions of racism cannot account for the history of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>This difficulty is deepened by the success of Jewish integration in contemporary Britain. Overwhelmingly a middle-class community, disproportionately represented in 'top professions,' lauded by the political elite and with a growing tendency to vote Conservative, British Jews are poorly positioned to evoke sympathy from those anti-racists who imagine that poverty, exclusion and racism always line up neatly together.</p> \n<p>And then there is the question of Israel/Palestine, which has poisoned the Labour Party debate on anti-Semitism in recent years and continues to do so today. The great majority of British Jews feel an attachment to Israel, constituted as Jewish state. This, of course, creates a further problem for those parts of the Left invested in a distinction between Jewish identity and Zionism as a political ideology.</p> \n<p>Attempts to fold Zionism into the history of European imperialism and settler-colonialism bring into sharp view the ongoing racism and injustice endured by Palestinians. At the same time, however, they obscure the fact that Zionism was in part a response to murderous racism experienced by Jews inside Europe.</p> \n<p>This tragic dynamic was captured powerfully by Hannah Arendt: &quot;The solution to the Jewish question merely produced a new category of refugees, the Arabs, thereby increasing the number of stateless and rightless by another 700,000 to 800,000 people.&quot;</p> \n<p>Israel today is a complex entity: while some focus solely on its democratic credentials, others point to its history of dispossession and occupation. It advertises its promotion of LGBTQI rights but remains a bastion of state-sponsored ethnic and religious privilege.</p> \n<p>Jewish statehood has generated a complicated history that sometimes makes it difficult for the left to even recognise anti-Semitism in Britain, let alone combat it.</p> \n<p>Labour needs to learn and reflect on how racisms of different sorts have figured in its own past and continues to shape the present. It should be possible to decry global inequality and support justice for the Palestinians without likening Israelis to Nazis, invoking the Jews’ special conspiratorial power or holding diaspora Jews directly responsible for the actions of the Israeli state.</p> \n<p>The challenge for the Labour Party’s leadership is to oppose racism unconditionally and without exception, including when its targets are Jews, most of whom do not support the party and who do identify with the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>There is also a challenge for the Jewish community, especially its leaders. Their alertness to anti-Semitism in Britain should lead them to support anti-racist campaigns more generally. It might also allow them, even as they identify with Israel, to recognize and censure the racialized inequalities within and beyond its recognised boundaries.</p> \n<p>In their different spheres, both the Labour Party and the leaders of the Jewish community should understand that anti-racism is not divisible.</p> \n<p>David Feldman is Director of the Pears Institute for the study of Antisemitism at Birkbeck, University of London where he is also a Professor of History.

        "text":["<p>A year ago, on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Levie Kanes of Kfar Haroeh, north of Tel Aviv, received a surprising email with a question that took the 75-year-old lawyer back to his infancy: “Are you baby Jantje de Ridder, who was taken off a train in mid-journey that departed The Hague on April 23, 1943?”</p> \n<p>Kanes couldn’t believe his eyes. Jan de Ridder was the name he was given when he was hidden from the Nazis with a Dutch family that had adopted him. Jantje was his nickname. Choking back tears, Kanes called the phone number listed in the email. His call was answered by Nina Gilead-Roelofs of Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael, a half-hour’s drive north of his home. The information that she provided required him to make some changes to what he had thought he had gone through during his childhood.</p> \n<p>He had lived his life with the mistaken belief that he had been saved from the Nazis by an unidentified Dutch Christian nurse who had snatched him at the last moment from a Nazi deportation train and then turned him over to the Dutch underground. Now 75 years later, the woman who actually saved him had a name, a biography of her own and a picture. She wasn’t a nurse, wasn’t Christian and was no longer anonymous.</p> \n<p>It turns out she was a Jewish physician named Nelly Roelofs and she was the mother of Nina Gilead-Roelofs of Kibbutz Ma’agan Michael. “I was in shock – a nice kind of shock,” Kanes recounted last week.</p> \n<p>Kanes’ prospects of survival during the Holocaust were slim. The Jewish child, born at a hospital in The Hague in January 1943, was destined for extermination from the beginning. His parents, Solomon and Caroline Kanes, were deported to the Westerbork transit camp in the Netherlands and then to Auschwitz, leaving Kanes alone in the hospital at first.</p> \n<p>On April 23, 1943, when he was three months old, Levie Kanes himself was put on a transport train headed for Westerbork. It’s at that point that Kanes’ life and that of the amazing physician Nelly Roelefs intersected.</p> \n<p>Born in Vienna, Roelofs immigrated to Holland in 1938 to pursue the love of her life. A short time earlier, on a tourist visit to Paris, she’d fallen in love with a painter named Giele Roelofs, who had been born into a famous family of artists that had provided art lessons to the Dutch royal family. Nelly and Giele, the Viennese Jewish woman and Dutch Christian man, were married in the Netherlands and started a family. In Nelly’s case, the fact she was married to Roelofs spared her the fate of most of the Jews of Holland, who were deported to their deaths. Nelly’s parents, who remained in Vienna under Nazi rule, were also saved thanks to their Dutch connection. Through the intervention of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, they were allowed to cross into Holland, then they hid in Amsterdam not far from Anne Frank’s hiding place.</p> \n<p>When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands in 1940, Nelly and Giele Roelofs joined an underground cell organized around a female artist named Henrica Ru Par&eacute;, later recognized by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center as one of Righteous Among the Nations, non-Jews who, at great personal risk, helped saved Jews during the Holocaust. She provided a hiding place to 50 Jews. On April 23, 1943, Nelly Roelofs set out to accompany a train from The Hague to Westerbork.</p> \n<p>A Dutch policeman on the train spotted the infant, Levie Kanes, alone on the train and spared his life. “He approached my mother and asked if she could find a hiding place for him,” Nina Gilead-Roelofs recounted last week. “They got off the train together at a stop along the way with my mother holding the baby in her arms,” Gilead added.</p> \n<p>‘I grew up under Nazis’ noses’</p> \n<p>Over the following two weeks, Dr. Roelofs cared for Kanes at her home in The Hague and even nursed him, which was possible because she was nursing a baby of her own at the time. She later turned him over to the underground leader, Henrica Ru Par&eacute;, who found him a home with a Catholic family in the south of the Netherlands with the help of a priest.</p> \n<p>“They raised me as a Christian. Every Sunday, I went to church,” Kanes said. The family that adopted Kanes ran a hotel called the Gold Lion, where among the guests were Nazi officers. “I grew up there, under [the noses of] the Nazis, who came there every day to drink beer,” Kanes recounted.</p> \n<p>Kanes’ father was murdered at Auschwitz, as were hundreds of others from the Kanes family, whose roots in Holland go back to the 15th century. Levie Kanes’ mother, Caroline, withstood the cruel medical experiments of Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz and survived the war. After the war, Kanes’ mother returned to The Hague, where she began to put her life back together. At first she worked as a prison warden at a jail for women who had collaborated with the Nazis. Later she married a Holocaust survivor who had also lost his family and they had a daughter.</p> \n<p>She ultimately also located her son, Levie, with the help of the Jewish community. “I didn’t want to go with them. I was very angry. I kicked and screamed: ‘You’re not my mother. I don’t want to go,’” Kanes recounted last week. “I pointed to my adoptive parents and said that they were my Mommy and Daddy,” Kanes said.</p> \n<p>It later became apparent that underground leader Henrica Ru Par&eacute; had seen to it after the war that all of the children whom she had helped save were provided for. She accompanied the 14 of them who remained orphans to Kibbutz Givat Brenner, south of Tel Aviv, where they were given a home.</p> \n<p>In Kanes’ case, after he was reunited with his mother, at first they lived in The Hague and then moved to Canada. Kanes was also to live in Costa Rica before immigrating to Israel in 1975. He started a family in Kfar Haroeh, a religious moshav.</p> \n<p>Story passed through generations</p> \n<p>Nelly Roelofs, the doctor, didn’t attempt to relocate Kanes after the war even though for a time both lived in The Hague, where Roelofs practiced medicine until her untimely death in 1976. “I’m sorry that I didn’t have the chance to meet her after the war and that she is not alive today,” Kanes lamented.</p> \n<p>Dr. Roelofs had five children, one of whom was killed in an accident. Nina is the only one of the children who moved to Israel. The story of how Nelly Roelofs saved the baby was passed on in the family from generation to generation. Nelly Roelofs told it to her daughter Nina, who in turn has recounted it to the succeeding two generations.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the family attempted to locate “the baby,” although they only knew the name he had been given by the Dutch underground, Jan de Ridder. Their efforts through Dutch immigrant groups failed to turn him up.</p> \n<p>“I ultimately became discouraged from looking for him and was sure that we would never meet,” Nina Gilead-Roelofs admitted. But a year ago, when her own granddaughters were asked to tell the story of their family’s rescue effort, a final attempt was made to find Kanes. Nina Gilead-Roelofs’ daughter Idit discovered that a Dutch historian was researching the children who had been saved by the Dutch underground, including Kanes.</p> \n<p>From that point, it became relatively easy to track down “the baby,” who is now 75. “It’s funny. It turns out that the little baby who I imagined has become a big man,” Nina said with a smile, looking at Kanes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the current #MeToo era, Israeli reality-show producer Assaf Gil came up with a brilliant idea: the senior producer of many local hit shows has developed a new reality format for the international market, called “The Silence Breaker,” which will be putting cases of sexual harassment in the workplace on display through footage from a hidden camera. The format will feature a confrontation at the end of each episode between the harassed women and their harassers.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel’s new #MeToo scandal highlights a dark corner of Startup Nation &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Gil also claimed that, unlike the high-profile cases that have been reported up to now and that have involved famous actresses, his program will expose the sexual harassment of &quot;regular&quot; women.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Well, I hope his TV format won't find buyers. The entry of a market force as virulent as reality TV into a field as sensitive and explosive as sexual harassment could inflict real harm on real women. Sexual harassment is a phenomenon that interferes with women's advancement, and can act to extort and paralyze us. The mere idea that all of this would be documented in a reality show that inherently seeks to generate as many tears as possible is shocking.</p> \n<p>The emotional well being of reality shows participants was&nbsp;never the&nbsp;editors' and TV executives'&nbsp;main concern. All they can see is dollar signs. And when a format is based on sexual harassment, it can be assumed that the program’s editors will be seeking to create such situations which will be as mortifying as possible – or, as they say in the business, as sexy as possible.</p> \n<p>The most galling aspect of his format is probably the promise that at the end of every episode, the victim of harassment will confront her harasser. The first principle that applies in providing assistance to victims of sexual harassment is that they not be confronted with their harassers. For some of the women, the experience of the harassment brings a wave of trauma of much more serious sexual violence to the surface.</p> \n<p>Nothing good will come of a confrontation that gives the perpetrator an opportunity to harm the victim further through accusations against her. If a woman is interested in confronting her harasser, she is free to do so, but on a program in which such a confrontation is part of the format, it is the victim who will pay the price.</p> \n<p>Sexual harassment pornography</p> \n<p>About three years ago I was one of the founders of a non-profit group called Layla Tov (Good Night) set up to combat sexual harassment in Israel’s night life scene. Many times TV channels asked us, sometimes as a condition to their reporting about our work, to provide a victim of sexual harassment or even assault whom they could interview.</p> \n<p>These requests are prompted by one thing alone: ratings, the obsessive need on the part of the media to supply the goods to the viewer in illustrative detail. It is sexual harassment pornography, and not a single viewer will have a better understanding of the problem from a graphic description of such physical contact.</p> \n<p>That’s because on television in particular, but in our society more generally, sexual violence still attracts advertisers. The new reality show is staking its ratings potential on this and even setting a media standard dictating that if a woman seeks a platform on which to speak about harassment, she must supply her personal story as a kind of merchandise.</p> \n<p>Criticism of the #MeToo movement for forgetting about women who are not in the limelight is frequently justified, and it is ordinary women, those who lack the power of publicity, who need support from social networks, not cynical exploitation for commercial gain.</p> \n<p>We can only hope that the program will remain without a buyer. I would like to believe that at Israeli television stations at least, they will understand that before they take part in a new sin, they need to cleanse their consciences of their sins of the past. After all, Yoram Zak returned to his job. In the best case, soul-searching on the part of Israeli television is just beginning.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Did King David even exist, let alone his fabled son, the wise King Solomon? And if they existed, did they rule over a powerful, united Jewish kingdom with its capital in Jerusalem? The truth is that to this day, no categorical proof of either the kings or the great kingdom has ever been found, leaving aside one suggestive engraving that some believe says &quot;House of David.&quot; Also, the interpretation of archaeological findings from their purported era, the 10th century B.C.E. has been controversial, to put it politely.</p> \n<p>Now the discovery of a second monumental building confidently dated to the Davidic period has been announced, in a Canaanite town that apparently had allied with a powerful Judahite kingdom. The discovery was made with the help of naked mole rats, little burrowing rodents endemic to the region.</p> \n<p>Skeptics claim that no fortifications, public works or signs of statehood have been found in the region of Judah from the Davidic era. Now, claim Bar-Ilan University archaeologists excavating a monumental structure at Tel ‘Eton, near the Hebron hills in the central Israeli lowlands – they have.</p> \n<p>They believe that structures dated to later times, may have actually originated earlier. The Bar-Ilan team argues that they found evidence of that very thing, with the help of a system they developed – mapping by mole rat.</p> \n<p>Their work on rodent-assisted surveying was published in 2016 by the Cambridge University Press.</p> \n<p>Signs of David</p> \n<p>The argument perennially raging over the existence of a United Kingdom under David and Solomon is really about whether the bible and Jewish tradition are historical, have grains of truth, or are folk tales.</p> \n<p>Skeptics say that no monumental constructs have been discovered in Jerusalem or nearby that date to the 10th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>Archaeologist Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University has been postulating for some years that Khirbet Qeiyafa is that very thing - some believe the edifice was even the palace of King David himself. Perched on a hilltop about 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, Qeiyafa was a strategically located town with a military fortress featuring massive fortifications built of gigantic stones that has been connected to the kingdom ruled from Jerusalem. Though its dating is controversial, Garfinkel believes Qeiyafa dates to the early 10th century B.C.E.</p> \n<p>Now the Bar Ilan people say, in their article in Cambridge's journal Carbon, that Tel 'Eton, 20 kilometers south of Qeiyafa, contains another such edifice.</p> \n<p>There is a snag. The vast majority of the findings in the house date to a couple of hundred years later, the 8th century B.C.E. But Prof. Avraham Faust and Yair Sapir of Bar-Ilan University suspect its foundations date from the period of the United Monarchy.</p> \n<p>The big house, which they dubbed the “governor’s residency” (though it could have been something entirely different) may exemplify what they call the &quot;old-house effect&quot;: a building or settlement that existed for generations, but only left significant remains from its final drama.</p> \n<p>What the mole rat says</p> \n<p>Faust has been excavating Tel 'Eton for a decade, and published the mole rat survey paper two years ago. One can dig up the whole tell with the hallmark patience and delicacy required of archaeology. Or one can pick digging locations by first sifting the back-dirt hills piled up by burrowing mole rats, whether the naked mole rat or the Palestine mole rat.</p> \n<p>The naked mole rat is a remarkable animal, not attractive by most standards unless one is into wrinkled pink skin, beady, practically vestigial black eyes and yellow fangs. That isn't acne on their cheeks, it's follicles for their sparse whiskers. Among the extraordinary features of the mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is resistance to pain and cancer, the ability to survive up to 18 minutes without oxygen – a useful trait for underground dwellers.</p> \n<p>Weirdest of all, mole rats have some sort of resistance to aging, a euphemism for living much longer than most rodents of their diminutive size. A mouse in the house won't live more than a few years, three or four if you feed it properly. A mole rat can live 30 years and counting. Unlike every other mammal known, their risk of death doesn't go up as they grow older, scientists marveled just this January. For us, the risk of death doubles roughly every eight years after age 30.</p> \n<p>Anyway, when these marvels of nature burrow, they conveniently toss out earth complete with little artifacts buried up to a meter deep. If the rodent piles contain lots of pottery sherds, the area had been settled. If not, not.</p> \n<p>“The mole rat told us that there is a small settlement in a place where nobody thought a settlement had existed,” Faust explains. And thus, with the inadvertent help of the rats, they found a whole lower city that had existed around the citadel. The rodents could even help mark its boundaries: outside the city limits, no sherds were found in the mole rat hills.</p> \n<p>Mole rat archaeology even helped find what seems to be a metal industry at the site, because the soil in the piles had been colored by slag – the refuse of smelting.</p> \n<p>Eyes fixed on the flames</p> \n<p>Mole rat archaeology may even have helped find where the city at Tel 'Eton came to its end, destroyed by King Sennacherib and the Assyrians as they swept over the land in around 701 B.C.E. The archaeologists noticed another burrow-free strip on the tell's southern slope. Subterranean structures connected with the titanic struggle between the Judahites and Assyrians apparently deterred the subterranean rodent.</p> \n<p>It is clear that the governor's house, the monumental structure atop the hill, had been destroyed by the Assyrians, he says: they found the arrowheads in the courtyard. Based on where they were found, the archaeologists could surmise whence the arrows were shot: precisely the place bereft of mole-rat activity, Faust says – like defense walls.</p> \n<p>A similar rat-free strip on the tell's slope toward the ridge evidently hides the Assyrian siege rampart, built of rocks.</p> \n<p>The city's destruction is unmistakable, from the marks of conflagration in the ruins – and the otherwise inexplicable abandonment of hundreds of serviceable vessels. In the hilltop manse, which is being studied with the help of the National Science Foundation in collaboration with Dr. Chaya Katz, they discovered about 200 intact pottery vessels and hundreds of other artifacts. They also found bones and seeds, and storage rooms with remains of wheat, grapes, lentils and more.</p> \n<p>The sheer richness of findings from the house's fiery demise creates a bizarre problem, Faust explains: as in other places, this wealth of material distracts from earlier stages of the building’s existence and skews the research discussion. Dating original construction becomes harder, and the vestiges from the early stages are sparse at best. Later layers, especially of destruction, soaking up all the attention is one of the reasons for the paucity of findings from the period of the United Monarchy.</p> \n<p>Borrowing a Canaanite practice</p> \n<p>In support of a powerful central kingdom is the fact that the governor’s house atop Tel ‘Eton couldn't have been built by some backwater. It contains ashlar stones, the earliest such use found yet, and was built on deep foundations, using quality building materials. Such investment in construction would be hallmarks of a complex society and a strong political entity.</p> \n<p>The first hint that the structure is far older than its destroyed top layer was the discovery of a deposit in the foundations, probably a protective offering to the gods. In this case, the deposit was a pottery bowl. Foundation deposits were a thing mainly in the Canaanite Bronze Age and early Iron Age.</p> \n<p>Also, a similar foundational offering was recently found in Tel Beit Shemesh dating to the period of the United Monarchy. These foundation deposits could have been made in towns that originated as Canaanite but joined the evolving Judahite kingdom.</p> \n<p>Definitely dated to Davidic era</p> \n<p>Radiocarbon samples from a foundation deposit and olive pits and coal found on the floor indicate that the Tel 'Eton house was first built in the late 11th century B.C.E. or the 10th century. &quot;This has bearings on the date in which social complexity evolved in Judah, on the debate regarding the historicity of the kingdom of David and Solomon,&quot; Faust and Sapir write.</p> \n<p>Over-representation of the final destruction is almost inevitable when a settlement ends in drama – like the Assyrians burning down Tel 'Eton. The transition from the United Monarchy to the Judean Kingdom was not accompanied by destruction, and therefore left few findings.</p> \n<p>Paradoxically, precisely because the Assyrians dramatically crushed most of the Judean Kingdom (with the weird exception of Jerusalem), thanks to this very violence – the Judean is the kingdom stands out in the archaeological record, while the United Monarchy does not. That also explains the paucity of United Monarchy-era structures in Jerusalem, says Faust. The city's continuation without a destruction phase between the United Monarchy and the Judean Kingdom caused evidence of the first kingdom to disappear.</p> \n<p>Archaeological research tends to discover more about the end of things than the beginning, Faust concludes.</p> \n<p>The bottom line: Factoring in the monumental building in Tel ‘Eton and Khirbet Qeiyafa, far from Jerusalem, and the 10th-century B.C.E. fortification of towns like Beit Shemesh, and construction of new towns such as Lachish, Tel Zayit and Tel Burna - Faust thinks the 10th century B.C.E. kingdom in Jerusalem gradually expanded toward the lowlands, a buffer zone between the hilly kingdom and the powerful Philistines on the coastal plain. During that period Canaanite cities and villages joined forces with the Jerusalem kingdom.</p> \n<p>“Qeiyafa was the first Judahite attempt to gain a foothold in the lowlands,&quot; says Faust, speculating that they deliberately chose to build on their fort on a small hill to avoid provoking the Philistines. “During this stage new settlements were established and the older ones became part of the kingdom, and at the same time Philistia became weaker. The Shfela in effect underwent a process of colonization by the kingdom on the hill, and there is mounting evidence that this kingdom had influence over large areas.”</p> \n<p>Skeptics like Prof. Zvi Lederman of Tel Aviv University, who is excavating Tel Beit Shemesh, say you can't date a whole town based on two olive pits from the foundations of a house: the context is insufficient.</p> \n<p>Dr. Ido Koch, also of TAU, accepts the dating but not the link of the site to the kingdom in Jerusalem: “I think that what we see in the Shfela is that the Canaanite culture reached the hills, rather than vice versa. If we have to seek a strong political entity during this period in the Shfela, it’s the Philistine city of Gath, and it’s possible that ‘Eton had an alliance with Gath rather than with Jerusalem. In findings from the 10th century there’s nothing with ‘Jerusalem’ written on it, and as long as no signs of Judean-style administration or writing – connecting 'Eton and Jerusalem is pure speculation.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Talaya Schmid, 34, from Zurich; flying there</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask how you spent your time in Israel?</p> \n<p>I visited friends in Tel Aviv and Haifa.</p> \n<p>Where do you know these friends from?</p> \n<p>I met one of them at a festival, and the other’s a friend of a friend. Four years ago I needed a vacation really badly, and I got here randomly and have been keeping in touch since.</p> \n<p>What do you do?</p> \n<p>I’m the organizer of an independent porn festival called Porny Days.</p> \n<p>Wow, interesting. Tell me about it.</p> \n<p>It’s not mainstream, it’s a fun thing, it’s intelligent. Also educational. It’s porn with a number of layers, in contrast to commercial porn that deals only with instant gratification, without changing anything in the life of the consumer.</p> \n<p>How did you get involved in pornography?</p> \n<p>I was actually an art student. One day a friend brought me a DVD of experimental feminist porn. I invited friends over to my apartment. We watched it, held a discussion over a glass of wine, and reached the conclusion that if there were other films like this we would watch them, too. And then I said I would organize a festival on the subject.</p> \n<p>Great initiative – so what happened?</p> \n<p>It started small and grew from 75 people to 2,500. Now it’s a three-day festival held in Zurich. We also have pop-up events called one-night stands. We did one like that in Israel last year.</p> \n<p>Where?</p> \n<p>At the Anna Loulou Bar in Jaffa, the Tel Aviv Cinematheque and the Kabareet nightclub in Haifa.</p> \n<p>Is the festival meant to be sexually arousing?</p> \n<p>That’s a small part of it. There’s an educational emphasis through panel discussions and workshops. There are documentaries, animation, performances. The sexual-arousal part is minor, but the other aspects are something that stays with you and goes home with you.</p> \n<p>What kind of workshops are there?</p> \n<p>Last year there was a “do-it-yourself vibrator” including the building of a small motor.</p> \n<p>Nice. What’s happening in indie porn?</p> \n<p>For example, there’s a porn site called Pink &amp; White, which isn’t divided into categories based on external appearance but only based on activities. When doing a search you can write what happens in the act, but the results that come up will include people from different genders with different appearances.</p> \n<p>Is this taboo in Western, progressive Switzerland?</p> \n<p>Switzerland is a bit stuck-up, but it can be liberal in the sexual sense. They make problems for us because of the festival’s name, Porny Days, because it includes the word “porn,” a term with a problematic image.</p> \n<p>Which you are reclaiming.</p> \n<p>Yes. There are still prejudices; I feel I need to apologize and explain that it’s not commercial porn. But our effort definitely injects a broader meaning into porn.</p> \n<p>Did your own sexuality change once you launched the festival?</p> \n<p>Yes. It’s the connection of the festival to my ego – I wanted to create a place for myself where I could learn positively, not like the day-to-day talk about women’s sexuality.</p> \n<p>What’s that talk like?</p> \n<p>It takes place in a medical form: hospitals, diseases or making babies. For example, science books say the clitoris can be up to two centimeters long, but it’s actually 10 centimeters [3.9 inches] long, into the body. Imagine if science books made a mistake like that about the size of the kidney. Think how calming the realization is that the clitoris and the G-spot are the same organ.</p> \n<p>But why hold a discussion at all?</p> \n<p>Because no one taught us how to talk about sex. People literally don’t know how to ask and how to say no. Sexuality is always secret, and if there’s a sex party, it’s held in some strange place outside of town. We hold ours in the heart of the city. We hold parties with a special place set aside where you can play. There are condoms, there’s supervision, but you can also not participate, just dance. Last year 800 people showed up. The whole Zurich techno scene was there.</p> \n<p>When’s the next festival?</p> \n<p>November 23 to 25. It’s always at the end of November. Also, in May 2019, we’re having a screening at the Haifa Independent Film Festival.</p> \n<p>What’s next?</p> \n<p>I want to go to the art schools in Switzerland and encourage the students to create their own content, because at the moment most of it comes from abroad.</p> \n<p>Nimrod Ben David, 38, from Ramat Gan, and Karin Tsabarim, 30, from Rehovot; arriving from Sofia</p> \n<p>Hi, can I ask you what you were doing in Bulgaria?</p> \n<p>Karin: It was supposed to be a ski trip, but it was one day of skiing and the rest was a fight with Bulgarians.</p> \n<p>Really? What did you fight about?</p> \n<p>They gave us a faulty snowboard. The plastic bindings that hold the feet were torn and it was unusable.</p> \n<p>Oy, I hope you didn’t fall.</p> \n<p>Obviously I did. Luckily for me I wasn’t going fast.</p> \n<p>And how did it come to a fight?</p> \n<p>Because they were obnoxious when we asked for compensation. The girl at the counter refused to give her name and shouted at us. I took out my phone and she screamed that it’s against Bulgarian law to take pictures. She said she’d call the police.</p> \n<p>And did the police come?</p> \n<p>Yes. We complained to them, but they only made sure we didn’t have photos in the phone and said “Okay, bye.”</p> \n<p>Did the place apologize to you?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: No, the woman from the place just screamed at us “I’ll break your phone” in a Dracula voice.</p> \n<p>Karin: We told them we would tell the press about them, and here you are!</p> \n<p>So you came back disappointed?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: Yes, snowboarding was an old dream of mine.</p> \n<p>So why only now?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: My friends didn’t feel like it. Then I met Karin two months ago and she was also into it. We went for it; we just needed to organize ourselves for dealing with Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Karin, was Shabbat important for you, too?</p> \n<p>Karin: I violate Shabbat actively.</p> \n<p>Nimrod: But she respects it.</p> \n<p>Where did you meet?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: We met in a Facebook group called [in Hebrew] “The Secrets of the Eternal Truth of Trance.” We started talking, clicked and went on.</p> \n<p>“The eternal truth”? What kind of group is it?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: Spiritual messages about awareness, nature. Writing about biblical verses and where they encounter us.</p> \n<p>Karin: But it’s not a religious group. The truth is, ideologically, the group doesn’t really suit me. I’m not especially spiritual and I tend not to use phrases like “the energy of the universe.”</p> \n<p>Then why are you there?</p> \n<p>Karin: Because I feel like I’ve connected with the group’s content and people, thanks to looking positively at things and mutual support. I totally find myself entering there at frustrating or boring moments – and fueling a smile for the rest of the day.</p> \n<p>Nimrod, are you more connected to spirituality?</p> \n<p>I believe that Judaism and Buddhism are two faiths that can intertwine, and the people in the group speak in those two voices. I admit there’s less Judaism, but in contrast to the outside dialogue, which is scornful, in the group there’s acceptance of everyone. People post messages that are right for them, they respond and argue. But mostly they listen.</p> \n<p>Do people sometimes come out of the Facebook group and meet in reality?</p> \n<p>Nimrod: There are meetings and parties – I’ve only been to one party. There was a dating post and there are workshops.</p> \n<p>Have you been to a workshop?</p> \n<p>Yes, a psychodrama workshop given by a girl named Chen Maimon.</p> \n<p>Did they dramatize a story of yours?</p> \n<p>I haven’t had a story of mine dramatized, but it doesn’t matter, because the stories converge. It might be someone who finds it hard to accept “no” in his job or in a relationship, or a girl who has issues with her father. You can find yourself in every story.</p> \n<p>How did it help you?</p> \n<p>It turns the story in your head into something verbalized, game-like and creative. So the pressure drops. An alter ego is created in the workshop, and afterward it can come out in everyday life, too, because it receives a place to express itself.</p> \n<p>So you can say that thanks to the group you met Karin and you finally had someone to go with on the snowboarding trip you dreamed about that lasted half an hour.</p> \n<p>Half an hour is better than nothing.</p> \n<p>Karin (laughing): Really mature.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Yael Medini was 17 when her father (and future prime minister) Moshe Sharett invited her to join him for a hush-hush ceremony in a small auditorium on 16 Rothschild Boulevard, Tel Aviv. Giora Hanoch, a pupil at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium high school, came to the ceremony to assist his uncle, who was recording the event. And Mordechai Rechtman, then 22, was there as a bassoonist in what was to become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.</p> \n<p>Seventy years have passed since these young people found themselves at one of the key moments in Israeli history: the Declaration of Independence by the State of Israel on May 14, 1948 (the fifth of Iyar in the Jewish calendar). Now in their 90s or close to it, they look back nostalgically, admitting that they didn’t grasp the momentousness of the occasion at the time.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t attach much importance to it,” Medini, now 88, tells Haaretz from her home in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. On a wall hangs the front page of The New York Times from May 15, 1948, with the headline “Zionists Proclaim New State of Israel.” The story includes photographs of her father and David Ben-Gurion.</p> \n<p>Alongside the NYT hangs another historical document: The draft declaration her father prepared for the founding of the state, in Yael Medini’s own handwriting.</p> \n<p>“The day before the declaration, my father dictated this document to me from notes he held in his hand,” Medini recalls. “After that, the secretary typed it out and from there it went to Ben-Gurion.” In the end, Ben-Gurion used his own version, which he read out at the ceremony. In Michael Bar-Zohar’s biography of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, he writes that Sharett was offended by Ben-Gurion’s criticisms and the decision to “correct” his draft.</p> \n<p>Through all the corrections and deletions in Medini’s draft, one can still make out the opening sentence as proposed by Sharett for the Declaration of Independence, outlining one of the reasons the Jewish people deserved to establish a state in Israel: “Since the Jewish nation was exiled by force from its land, the Land of Israel, it remained loyal to it throughout its years in exile and in all the countries it was dispersed in,” it states. “In all its wanderings, the Jewish people never found a country to replace it and never ceased praying and hoping to gather its dispersed members and renew its independence in that land.”</p> \n<p>Medini was born in 1930 and grew up in Jerusalem. She is a member of a distinguished family, one that also included Shaul Avigur, who headed the intelligence service that smuggled Jews into British-controlled Palestine; Eliyahu Golomb, head of pre-state underground Jewish militia the Haganah; and Dov Hoz, who carried out numerous diplomatic and defense-related missions.</p> \n<p>On the eve of the ceremony, Medini’s father received two tickets. One was for himself – since he was sitting on the main stage and was one of the 37 signatories to the declaration. He gave the second ticket to his sister, Ada (Golomb’s wife), who shared it with Yael.</p> \n<p>“We sat together on the same chair, me and my aunt,” recounts Medini. Her home features a photograph commemorating the historic event. However, only her forehead is visible in the picture of the crowd, comprised of several hundred people squeezed into a packed auditorium.</p> \n<p>When asked if she was excited to see her father on stage, she answers in the negative. “I didn’t quite get what his position was,” she says. “I knew he was working to establish the soon-to-be state, laboring from dawn until he was exhausted. But I wasn’t involved in those things. I didn’t know any better then,” she says with a smile.</p> \n<p>After the ceremony, a Haaretz correspondent asked her father how he felt during the very first moment of an independent Hebrew state. “I grew older by one minute,” he replied, “and I hope I continue to grow very old in this country.” (He eventually died at age 70 in 1965.)</p> \n<p>From there, Sharett and his daughter went to the Golomb family home on 23 Rothschild Boulevard (now the site of the Haganah Museum). After receiving hugs and kisses, he went out to the balcony. “Outside was a huge crowd, which appeared to be waiting for my father to say something,” Medini recounts. Sharett made do with a short sentence, which as she recalls went, “There is much work ahead. Let everyone go home and fulfill his role.”</p> \n<p>Shortly afterward, Yael joined the just-formed Israel Defense Forces. “I worked in field kitchens, washing enormous pots. It wasn’t easy because there was no hot water,” she says. When asked if she could have had a more meaningful role due to her father’s status, she demurs: “I didn’t feel any lack of dignity doing that job; I saw myself as an essential cog in the war machine.” Later in life she became an author, writing books for children, teenagers and adults.</p> \n<p>When asked her thoughts on the state today, she asks that we stop recording the interview. A hint of what she refused to discuss can be found in an interview she gave in 2012, when she told Haaretz: “I’m not certain that it would have been possible to establish a state today.”</p> \n<p>An urgent request</p> \n<p>Prof. Giora Hanoch, who also witnessed the declaration up close, is not optimistic 70 years on. “I’m very disappointed,” he says, talking to Haaretz at his home in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv. Like Sharett’s daughter, he also got an invitation to the ceremony. However, unlike her, he was there for work.</p> \n<p>Hanoch, who later became an expert in microeconomics and labor economics, was born in British Mandatory Palestine in 1932. His father, Gershon, wrote articles on art and cultural affairs, including for Haaretz.</p> \n<p>On May 14, 1948, when Giora Hanoch was 15, his uncle, Lucien Zaltzman, called and asked for his help. Zaltzman owned a recording company called Tslil – the Palestine Electrical Recording Company.</p> \n<p>“He told me he’d been invited at the last minute to record an important event and asked whether I could help him carry different things,” recalls Hanoch. The previous day, his uncle had received a letter from the Philharmonic Orchestra, asking him to come to their offices “on a very urgent matter.” He was also asked to be prepared to record.</p> \n<p>The young Hanoch was busy at the time in the pre-military Gadna program, which included observation and guard duty, and different missions for the Haganah. But his uncle’s request sounded very important.</p> \n<p>“We bypassed the audience and the crowds that had begun to assemble outside, and entered the auditorium in order to prepare the recording equipment,” Hanoch remembers. “It was very crowded in the hall. Everything there was set up at the last moment, while we were busy installing the recording devices,” he adds. On one of the microphones they placed a white cloth band with the name Tslil. In retrospect, this would be the country’s first “advertisement.”</p> \n<p>As described in historian Mordechai (also written Mordecai) Naor’s book “The Friday that Changed Destiny,” Zaltzman and Hanoch used a vinyl record-engraving machine to capture the 30-minute ceremony; only four minutes could be recorded on each side. Seventy years on, only one of the six records made at the time has survived. Baruch Zaltzman, Lucien’s son, saved it from the Philharmonic archive, where it had been gathering dust over the years.</p> \n<p>This was not the only artifact from the event that was not adequately preserved. The pages from which Ben-Gurion read out the declaration have disappeared without trace. Another draft (aside from the one hanging in Medini’s home) was recently put up for auction, but its fate is currently being decided by the courts.</p> \n<p>Hanoch, who was apparently the youngest person present on the big day, remembers being bored by the wait as the declaration was being signed.</p> \n<p>“The whole process was a bit long and tedious,” he recalls. “They read out all the names of the people in the provisional government – including the people who couldn’t attend because of the Siege of Jerusalem. It took ages for everyone to ascend the stage, sign it and then come down. It was a bit annoying,” he admits.</p> \n<p>Later, when Hanoch compared the recording of Ben-Gurion’s remarks with the text that appeared on the parchment – which was prepared only after the ceremony – he found some differences. For instance, the written declaration says that “the State of Israel will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture.” But Hanoch says that in the live version, the wording was in a different order: “Freedom of religion, conscience, education, culture and language.”</p> \n<p>When the ceremony ended, Hanoch returned to his parents’ home near the Habima Theater, at the top of Rothschild Boulevard. “I told them about it, but I wasn’t very emotional. Neither were they. I didn’t think my presence there was that special,” he recounts.</p> \n<p>Concerns about what lay ahead probably overshadowed the happiness. “There was joy in people’s hearts, but the atmosphere was very tense,” Hanoch says.</p> \n<p>In later decades, he reflects, “the state had great achievements and solved many economic problems. But all the definitions of public morality we dreamed about were violated.”</p> \n<p>A divine inspiration</p> \n<p>Another professor who emerged from the group of youngsters lucky enough to be present at the ceremony is musician Rechtman, who will celebrate his 92nd birthday in May. In contrast to Medini and Hanoch, he is optimistic as he looks back. “I’m not only a proud Jew, I’m a proud Israeli,” he says, reflecting on the last 70 years. “I don’t think there’s a country in the world that doesn’t have negative aspects, but I want to talk about the positive things,” he explains.</p> \n<p>Rechtman was born in Germany in 1926, immigrating to Israel at age 8 after the Nazis came to power. He used to practice the recorder and harmonica on his balcony, where his playing caught the attention of a musician neighbor. The neighbor recommended that he try the bassoon, and from there Rechtman’s progress was meteoric. In 1941, at the age of only 15, he became the first bassoonist in the then-Palestine Opera Orchestra. In 1946, he assumed the same role in the philharmonic orchestra.</p> \n<p>Two years later, he became part of that orchestra’s smaller ensemble, which got to play the national anthem, “Hatikva,” at the declaration ceremony. When asked if his participation had left a mark on him – given the countless international achievements he racked up in later decades as an arranger, conductor and professor at Tel Aviv University – he admits, “No, not a thing.”</p> \n<p>However, he doesn’t deny the national significance of the Declaration of Independence. “It was simply divine. Until then I’d held a British Mandatory Palestine passport, and all of a sudden I was Israeli,” he says. “It was very moving. What could be more moving?”</p> \n<p>He was drafted into the IDF the next morning, where he continued to perform – but this time for the soldiers.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there’s a precedent for a country surrounded by enemies, declaring its independence and continuing to play music during a war,” Rechtman says excitedly. “We played on the Burma Road; we appeared in front of wounded soldiers in hospitals and camps. We played the whole repertoire – Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. The soldiers, who were 18, 19 and 20 years old, kept asking for more.”</p> \n<p>Speaking at his home in Ramat Aviv, a suburb of Tel Aviv, he relates many fascinating stories about 1948 and the decades that followed. But then he stops, noting, “For such stories, not even a phone book will suffice.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>At 9 P.M. on August 26, 2000, team after team of the Duvdevan special operations force left the settlement of Shavei Shomron. Their destination was a house in the village of Asira al-Shamaliya, which lies on the slopes of Mount Eival near Nablus.</p> \n<p>According to their intelligence, a high-priority target was in the house, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, who in the days before the second intifada was considered a top member of Hamas’ armed wing, responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis. Everything was going according to plan until one of the team’s snipers thought he saw armed men on the roof of the house and started shooting.</p> \n<p>But this was a case of mistaken identity. The men taking fire weren’t Palestinians, they were Duvdevan soldiers. Three first sergeants were killed on the spot: Niv Yaacobi, Roy Even-Filsteiner and Liron Sharvit.</p> \n<p>“There was shooting and I was told to go to the roof where Niv and Liron were,” says the team’s medic, Brian (a made-up name like all others in this story). “I got to the roof and saw Niv and Liron lying side by side without moving, wounded in the head and chest. I ran to Niv, he was my closet friend on the team. I knew there was nothing I could do but I sat there and held his head. I couldn’t let go.”</p> \n<p>Brian kept hearing shouts to go see what had happened to Liron. “I ran to him,” Brian recalls, “and we tried to resuscitate him, but there was nothing we could do. They were both dead.”</p> \n<p>Yaacobi, Sharvit and Even-Filstein are three of the 15 Duvdevan soldiers who have been killed since the unit was established in 1986 (two other fatalities were of soldiers attached to the unit from other units). Of course, military units tend to have fatalities, but in this unit, none of the 15 were killed by enemy fire. In most cases it was training accidents or, like on that evening in Asira al-Shimaliya, friendly fire during an operation.</p> \n<p>Operation Symphony of Life was the army’s code name for the capture of Abu Hanoud. That symphony became a trauma that has been with Brian ever since, and now he’s in his late 30s.</p> \n<p>“When I came down from the roof I was led to the street, where I just sat and shivered,” he says. “Today I know that the minute I went on the roof was the minute I was wounded. My post-trauma is a battle wound like any other, like losing an arm or a leg.”</p> \n<p>Brian, who came to Israel on his own and was a lone soldier during his service, took a long time to realize what had happened. “In our team we didn’t talk about the impact of that incident; we wanted to suppress it,” he says. “Asira became a taboo topic – no one talked about it, at least not before demobilization.”</p> \n<p>It took several years after Brian left the demobilization center before he understood the scar that this incident had left on his soul. He isn’t alone. His unit, which often operates with its members dressed undercover as Palestinians, conducts hundreds of missions a year in an attempt to foil terror attacks. In these operations soldiers win many citations and medals, on top of the wounds that don’t bleed and often don’t heal.</p> \n<p>Now, 32 years after it was established and 26 years after it was declassified, its members are launching a campaign for their comrades who have been bearing the impact of combat.</p> \n<p>Such an effort isn’t anything obvious for such a unit. This is a group whose members at any moment must be aggressive and daring while seeking contact with the enemy, a unit where a term like post-traumatic stress disorder is often excluded from the lexicon.&nbsp;Former soldiers in the Duvdevan unit include Lior Raz and Avi Issacharoff, who created the hit TV show &quot;Fauda&quot; based off their experiences.</p> \n<p>But now things are changing. Two and a half years ago former Duvdevan soldiers set up the Scheinberg Foundation, which helps lone soldiers after demobilization. Last year it began to locate and treat veterans with PTSD. The foundation set up support groups, helping these people obtain the support of the Defense Ministry and get medical treatment.</p> \n<p>Off the rails on vacation</p> \n<p>One of the veterans who regularly attends meetings is Or, now in his 30s. He was totally unaware of the emotional damage caused by his service in the Duvdevan. “It hit me on a trip to the Far East. I was in a taxi and the driver’s kid was sitting next to him,” Or says.</p> \n<p>“All of a sudden I thought he wanted to kill me, that he had exposed me and I was in danger. I remember thinking that I had to kill this kid and run away. I started going wild in the taxi, hitting the driver. He stopped and let me out. I found myself begging him to take me anyway and not leave me in the middle of nowhere.”</p> \n<p>Looking back, when Or reconstructs the road he has taken, he thinks back to his time in the Duvdevan. “It was total,” he says. “It got to a point where you didn’t go home on a weekend so that nothing affected your training, so that nothing distracted you. I took myself to the limit.”</p> \n<p>He now realizes it was too extreme. “When I was over there I didn’t ask any questions,” Or says. “I was totally immersed in it, and that’s what I wanted in life. All I wanted was to be worthy in the eyes of my team, that anyone going on a mission with me could trust me.”</p> \n<p>There was some intimation of his problems during his service, he admits. He remembers how a few months before demobilization he went to his commander, put his pistol and kaffiyeh on the table and said he was leaving. He couldn’t take it anymore. He was offered a short leave. He agreed, returned and completed his service.</p> \n<p>“No one knew anything about it; I hid it. My family didn’t know what I was doing, my girlfriend didn’t know either,” Or says. “I hid everything I could and didn’t really have an open relationship with anyone in that delusional situation. I was under emotional stress that I couldn’t put my finger on until one day I broke down in tears at my parents’ house.”</p> \n<p>The real crisis hit on that trip to the Far East. At that moment he couldn’t distinguish between his life and the life of the character he had assumed in the past. “I found myself on that trip taking part in a Muslim purification ritual,” Or says.</p> \n<p>On another occasion he was struck by anxiety when he encountered a Muslim man on the street. “I began to think I’d been exposed,” he says. “At one point I ditched my motorcycle because I believed I had been discovered and that someone had booby-trapped it. The whole trip was like a movie where someone was testing me.”</p> \n<p>Upon returning to Israel, Or realized he had a problem and needed to do something to keep his sanity. The first to help him were the former members of his team.</p> \n<p>“Outwardly, everything seemed irrelevant and meaningless,” he says. “At some point I wished I’d taken a bullet on a mission so I’d be recognized as a wounded fighter. That would have given me legitimization to feel that way.”</p> \n<p>Or’s descriptions sound very familiar to Brian’s. He too went on a long trip after the army, trying to forget his time in the military, escaping from himself. “I traveled everywhere but almost immediately I left each place I had reached,” he says. “I couldn’t stay in one place. I flew to Australia, India, Mexico, Fiji.”</p> \n<p>At some point he landed in Morocco and remembers not feeling well; he had probably caught pneumonia. “I found myself entering a mosque and going to sleep there. I got up in the morning and ran off as if someone were trying to kill me,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Asira was with me the whole time: escapes, noises, it was all there. I traveled around the world with a feeling that I was responsible for Niv and Liron’s deaths, that I should have run to that roof faster and done something that might have saved them. Today I know they died instantly, but the feeling didn’t leave me.”</p> \n<p>In addition to finding a way to contain all these emotions, there’s another difficulty: how to share them. Or says he had great problems making contact with team members after he returned. He says he wasn’t adequately understood.</p> \n<p>“I understand the unit’s work and am aware of its importance, but you have to be a bit crazy to do that work, he says. “We don’t go in crazy; you get that during your service. You’re trained for it. So when you leave they should take responsibility for how you leave for civilian life with that burden.”</p> \n<p>Today he says that if he had received some help in advance, maybe he wouldn’t have had to spend so much of his own money on therapy. “They load your hard disk and even if they don’t know how to unload it when you demobilize they should give us tools for dealing with that load,” he says. “Now I think about it 30 percent of the time, but I’ve learned to live with it.”</p> \n<p>Seeking out the sufferers</p> \n<p>In an event held by the unit, Brian met one of his officers from that night in Asira. The officer, who still serves in the Duvdevan in the reserves, asked Brian how he was. “I don’t know who I am,” Brian replied. “I don’t know what’s with me.”</p> \n<p>After that event the officer decided to contact Or. When the two talked, he realized the gravity of the problem. Those talks, as well as conversations with other fighters who were clamoring for help, changed something in his way of thinking.</p> \n<p>“We realized there were true difficulties for some of these soldiers after demobilization,” the officer says. “We went to Canada, me and a few other members of the unit, to try to build a model of therapy and assistance.”</p> \n<p>It took time but this is how the Scheinberg Foundation’s initiative to help demobilized soldiers began. “The hardest challenge is in finding the fighters,” the officer says. “No one comes on his own initiative asking for help. We have to reach them. We’re now accompanying eight former fighters, but if you ask me where we’ll be in 10 years, I believe it will grow at least tenfold.”</p> \n<p>In addition to helping demobilized soldiers get the help they need, the officer has set another goal: to develop awareness of the problem in the unit and create a system that will accompany soldiers throughout their service.</p> \n<p>“My vision is that this issue will be part of the soldier’s training,” he says. “We have to talk about it every few months, sit down and talk after dramatic incidents, analyze what happened and how it affected everyone.”</p> \n<p>He says that if soldiers learn to identify symptoms of PTSD such as sleeplessness, stress and a lack of appetite, “they’ll be able to recognize it in a teammate on time. Turning to a commander could prevent something more serious in the future.”</p> \n<p>Now, a year after the foundation launched similar efforts, Brian and Or not only get help, they try to find others and help them too. One person they’ve located is Yehuda, now in his 40s, who was only recently diagnosed as suffering from PTSD. He still does his reserve duty in the Duvdevan.</p> \n<p>“Until a year ago I couldn’t understand my serious sleep problems,” Yehuda says. “There were entire days I couldn’t fall asleep, sometimes making my whole body shake.”</p> \n<p>It was suggested to Yehuda that this might be related to his military service. “They always told me to see if it was related and I’d laugh,” he says. “I did all the diagnostic tests for sleep problems, and in the end the doctor diagnosed me as post-traumatic.”</p> \n<p>Yehuda is known by anyone who joined the unit in the ‘90s. For years he was the first face encountered by people arriving there; he took them on marches designed to foster group cohesion. Even now he doesn’t have one bad thing to say about the Duvdevan, but he sees the system, mainly the Defense Ministry, as the obstacle.</p> \n<p>“When a fighter has a problem he faces a ministry official and he’s told that something is wrong with him, that his behavior is strange. But when I accepted him to the unit I saw him as someone suitable. Something happened on the way. He doesn’t have to wage a campaign against the army so that he’s recognized as suffering from post-trauma. Someone needs to take responsibility.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, says the officer, the foundation is there for anyone in need. “We’re trying to reach the snipers who were in Asira. We want to hug them and give them support if they need it. It’s important that people realize that post-trauma can express itself in signs you don’t think are important, but it’s there and it’s best to open up and talk about it,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I had an instance after Operation Symphony of Life when I was at home in front of my refrigerator. There was a cheese called Symphony, and when I opened it I got the smell of the bodies from Asira. Am I post-traumatic? I don’t know.”</p> \n<p>Haaretz correspondent Yaniv Kubovich, a Duvdevan veteran, is now a member of the Duvdevan Association.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Pita is a carbohydrate wonder, with a pocket that appears mysteriously during the baking process and can be filled with almost anything you want. It’s no surprise that pita is the unchallenged ruler of Israeli street food: It has long since stopped being a way to catch a bite in transit, and has become the new and challenging playing field of many chefs. Assembling the pita is a real art: Although it looks like a simple task, finding the ideal proteins and creating the surrounding salads are not. Only the best chefs can figure out how to do it and compete for the loyalty of hungry eaters.</p> \n<p>Whether you favor the beloved crispy falafel with tahini and amba (a mango chutney), or seek adventure in the form of juicy variety meats and upgraded salads, the offerings in Tel Aviv are always surprising. From veteran pita stands to new places that are revolutionizing the genre, this is a world in which “magicians” and “doctors” are doing holy work in the kitchen. We decided to go on a journey in search of the perfect pita.</p> \n<p>Falafel Hakosem (The Magician’s Falafel)</p> \n<p>A man who understands the genius of excellent street food is Ariel Rosenthal, the magician who 17 years ago started a modest falafel stand that has become an empire. The understanding that street food is an experience of flavors, smells and a connection to the busy street has transformed Hakosem from just another food stand to an art of entertaining no less exciting than that of a trendy chef’s restaurant. The fresh ingredients, creative portions and friendly service justify the long lines of hungry customers waiting for a taste of the outstanding pita prepared here.</p> \n<p>What goes in the pita? A spicy and comforting portion of Moroccan fish (48 shekels), the famous Hakosem falafel, which started it all (19 shekels); juicy shwarma (36 shekels) that goes great with the variety of fresh salads, headed by the fine hummus whose quality is the result of the personal import of chickpeas and excellent Al Arz tahini. The portions also come in a platter version, but who needs it?</p> \n<p>Hakosem, Shlomo Hamelech 1, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Bino</p> \n<p>If you’ve been to Rothschild Boulevard in recent months and have come across the legendary cardboard figure of Dr. Shakshuka peering among the bushes, you were probably happy to discover that the most famous shakshuka in Jaffa (eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, chili peppers, and onions) has arrived at the city’s trendiest boulevard. Bino, Dr. Shakshuka’s most recent addition, operates in a younger and simpler format than the original restaurant, and combines the Jaffa classics with new and equally tasty dishes. Bino Gabso, who declares a special relationship with the beloved pocket of dough, retains the desirable title of “doctor” and proves that even at the age of 65 it’s possible to surprise people within the round soft borders of pita.</p> \n<p>What goes in the pita? Bino’s addictive mutton shwarma with spicy chuma pepper, tahini and eggplant salad (38 shekels); a super-shakshuka in pita or in a skillet, which can receive upgrades of merguez (spicy frankfurters) and mushrooms (22-45 shekels). In the new dishes section they are offering the Shaul Evron mix, which includes a variety of spicy internal organs, a dish dedicated to Bino’s dear friend (38 shekels). Vegans will also find consolation here in the guise of egg-free shakshuka with mushrooms (45 shekels) and pita and falafel with cabbage and tahini (19 shekels).</p> \n<p>Bino, Rothschild 73, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Jasmino</p> \n<p>Jasmino, the hottest name in Tel Aviv street food, has earned songs of praise for its juicy, unusual chunks of meat. Its owners decided to waive attractive design, superfluous sophistication and even music, and instead focused on creating a marvelously tasty and affordable assortment of pitas. Along with an excellent strategic location – which at noon serves the passerby from bustling Allenby Street and at night continues with the partygoers at the parallel Har Sinai complex – it’s clear why the place has already become a sensation.</p> \n<p>What goes&nbsp;in the pita? On the menu listed on the ceramic tiles there are only four choices, with everything prepared on site of course: the famous kebab from a mixture of mutton and veal (28 shekels); beef hotdogs with spicy seasoning (29 shekels); chicken breasts (30 shekels); and a cool twist of veal heart in a spicy marinade (28 shekels). Sometimes there are equally amazing specials of lamb tonsils (45 shekels); flank steak or rump steak (45 shekels); and mixed internal organs (28 shekels). All these are arranged with amazing precision inside the pita, along with spicy pepper and onion hot from the grill, a fresh vegetable salad, tahini and a pinch of amba.</p> \n<p>Jasmino, Allenby 97, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Mifgash Haosher (Happiness Joint)</p> \n<p>This small and charming place on King George Street was established over four years ago. Since then it has managed to create a reputation for itself as one of the most fun pita places in town. At Mifgash Haosher, owned by Bentzi Arbel and Omri Kravitz, there is true respect for the concept of street food; they lend the experience a feeling of meticulous preparation and a lot of attention even to the smallest details. The ingredients of every portion are first placed in a stainless steel bowl, so that all the flavors and ingredients can blend in harmony before being placed inside the pita. You can have fun eating at one of the small tables on the street, or you can take the pita and sit on one of the pleasant benches on nearby Masaryk Square.</p> \n<p>What&nbsp;goes&nbsp;in the pita? The on-target menu offers a daily portion of happiness on a plate (but that’s for another article), or hidden in pita, of course. Aside from light-colored and extra crispy falafel balls (18 shekels), you’ll also find an inspired idea in the form of sabich (fried eggplant with hard-boiled egg in pita) with sour cream and sweet potato (22 shekels); cauliflower sabich with a brown egg and vegetables (26 shekels) and a lighter pita with chickpeas and curry, along with a tart labaneh (20 shekels).</p> \n<p>Mifgash Haosher, King George 105, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Miznon</p> \n<p>Eyal Shani’s pita empire is probably responsible for the pita revival on the streets of Tel Aviv. Shani’s genius lies not only in his amazing ability to turn simple ingredients into a culinary addiction (which could in theory be prepared at home), but also in the precise and pioneering analysis of the needs of the average Israeli diner. With three local branches, two in Europe and another two locations in process in Australia and the United States, Shani is providing great public relations for Israeli cuisine and the perfection that pita can contain.</p> \n<p>What&nbsp;goes&nbsp;in the pita? The new inspiration is called a falafel burger; it comes with sour cream, red onions, a pickle and of course roasted tomatoes (27 shekels). Among the old favorites you’ll find minute steak (46 shekels) and the excellent ratatouille made from eggplant, squash, tomatoes and onions that are roasted slowly in the oven and combined with an egg (34 shekels).</p> \n<p>Miznon, King George 30, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Carmel</p> \n<p>Shai and Eyal Kitzis, the owners of the Asian eatery The Bun in the Carmel Market, decided after six years of activity to take on their next culinary challenge. A few months ago the two started a new stand at the entrance to the Carmel Market (a few meters from The Bun), where they grill several great skewers that are not especially sophisticated, and serve them in pita with a selection of additions. It’s worth mentioning that you won’t find tables and spacious seating here, but if you’re already spending a day of wandering around in the market atmosphere - don’t hesitate to eat standing up and let the tahini drip out.</p> \n<p>What&nbsp;goes&nbsp;in the pita? Lovers of the skewer genre can say “eeny, meeny,&nbsp;miny,&nbsp;moe” and end up with a familiar classic that any hungry person would be happy to get: chicken breast, kebab, lamb internal organs, merguez sausages, slow-cooked short ribs and a mixed vegetarian cauliflower pita (30-45 shekels). You’re invited to add to the pocket tahini, sumac onion, amba (of course), greens, tomato salad on the grill and spicy green peppers.</p> \n<p>Carmel, Hillel Hazaken 18, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Frishman Sabich</p> \n<p>Sometimes you don’t have to attack the pita in a roundabout manner. It’s enough to focus on one portion, and simply to make it as good as possible. Frishman Sabich, which is owned by Danny Pe’er and Itzik Sapir, has long been famous for specializing in the romantic triangle formed by the egg, the pita and the eggplant, and does so with great success. The original location on the corner of Dizengoff and Frishman streets has managed to expand to the nearby Frishman Falafel, and to create additional branches throughout the country. We’re the winners.</p> \n<p>What goes&nbsp;in the pita? At Frishman Sabich they understand the uniqueness of every diner and along with the good old sabich (19 shekels) they also offer cheese sabich with feta that replaces the hummus (23 shekels), a healthy version that comes in a whole wheat handmade pita; a vegan sabich without an egg and even portions in gluten-free pita (24 shekels). All the portions are also available on platters (29 shekels)</p> \n<p>Frishman Sabich, Frishman 42, Tel Aviv</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Polish Holocaust Law has aroused outrage because of its refusal to recognize the part Poles played as accessories to the Holocaust. It is true that Poland fought the Germans on the battlefield and as an underground army in German occupied Poland, and yet many Poles assisted the Germans in their persecution of the Jews. </p> \n<p>Motivated by political considerations, the law not only denies this fact, but makes such revelations unlawful. The part played by many of the people of Europe in the destruction of Europe’s Jews is by now well known.</p> \n<p> Denials of such acts of complicity are blatant attempts to fabricate Holocaust history. Hopefully the ongoing contacts between the governments of Poland and Israel will bring about a change in the present formulation of the law. But there is a lesson to be learned: Watch out for politically motivated attempts to rewrite history.</p> \n<p>When you go to the Yad Vashem Museum in Jerusalem you might be surprised to see a politically motivated attempt to rewrite history. The display devoted to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising presents Mordechai Anielewicz as commander of the uprising, and although not ignoring Pawel Frenkel and the fighters of the Jewish Military Union commanded by him, it assigns them no more than a secondary role in the uprising. The fact is that the central battle of the uprising in the ghetto was fought by Pawel Frenkel’s fighters (also known by the group’s Polish acronym the ZZW) at Muranowski Square. There, after raising the Zionist and Polish flag over one of the large buildings along the square, they battled Jurgen Stroop’s SS troops for four days.</p> \n<p>The evidence confirming the central role of Frenkel and his fighters in the uprising has been available for over 72 years. It was presented by the American prosecution in the Nuremberg Trials at the end of 1945, when quotes from one of Stroop’s daily communiqu&eacute;s describing the fighting at Muranowski Square were read before the court. It was widely reported in the international press including the Hebrew press in Palestine at the time, but has been studiously ignored for many years.</p> \n<p> Many quotes from his communiqu&eacute;s appear in my book “Flags over the Warsaw Ghetto,” first published in Hebrew in 2009.</p> \n<p> Instead, the historical evidence was altered, by politicians and historians alike, to present Anielewicz as the commander of the uprising, while assigning to Frenkel and his fighters at most a secondary role. This fabrication of an important event in the history of the Holocaust was clearly motivated by political and ideological considerations: Anielewicz’s group had a socialist outlook, while Frenkel’s group was more Zionist Revisionist. Unfortunately, this distortion of the historical record persists to this day at Yad Vashem. </p> \n<p>An example of the attitude of some of Israel’s Holocaust historians to the narrative of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is Prof. Daniel Blatman’s review of my book published in Haaretz over eight years ago. He writes that everything is already known about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising; therefore, there is no need for additional research. </p> \n<p> He also claims “that the Stroop communiqu&eacute;s have been examined and evaluated with great care by a number of historians who researched the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and its suppression.” Seemingly, there is nothing more to be learned from them. </p> \n<p>Numerous attempts to convince the management of Yad Vashem to revise the display in the museum so as to correctly represent the central role of the Jewish Military Union in the uprising have so far produced no results. Yad Vashem stubbornly clings to its version of the narrative of the uprising. </p> \n<p>It does not come as a surprise that the displays devoted to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw have followed in the footsteps of Yad Vashem, possibly as a result of advice provided by Yad Vashem. </p> \n<p>At the museum in Warsaw Stroop’s battle communiqu&eacute;s in German are actually available for perusal and if the visitor knows German and is so inclined he can leaf through them and learn of the true course of events during the uprising. Attempts to convince the management of these museums to correct their presentation of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising have so far fallen on deaf ears.</p>",

But before removing him from the MIA list, the unit is asking the public for help – maybe someone is still around who actually knew him.</p> \n<p>Katz’s file went to Prof. Yoram Epstein, a physiologist and one of the unit’s longest serving veterans in the reserves. In the army's archives, Epstein discovered that, according to the IDF, Katz was one of the three soldiers killed on May 16, 1948 in an ambush; the Palmach, the pre-independence army’s strike force, had tried to blow up the Hatzbani Bridge in southern Lebanon.</p> \n<p>While the other two soldiers who were killed in the operation, Gad Greenboim and Avigdor Kremersh, have pictures and full biographies including birthdates and names of their parents, Katz’s file is empty. Greenboim and Kremersh were buried at the Kibbutz Kfar Giladi cemetery in the far north near where they were killed, and their bodies were later reinterred at Tel Aviv’s Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery. But Katz can’t be found buried anywhere.</p> \n<p>Epstein managed to locate the company commander who led the force, who said that only two soldiers were killed in the incident, and other Palmach veterans agreed. Epstein later found a document in the archives with Katz listed as killed in action at the Hatzbani Bridge, his serial number next to his name.</p> \n<p>But when Epstein checked the number in the IDF’s databases, it belonged to a different Shlomo Katz, a Haifa resident who served during the War of Independence on the Jerusalem front and was actually still alive. “I’ve examined every possible thing,” Epstein says, referring to what he does before he takes the dramatic step of removing someone from the list of MIAs.</p> \n<p>Another name that has kept Epstein and the rest of Eitan busy is Moshe Ben Tov (Treblinski). During World War II, Ben Tov fled Poland to Russia and later reached British Mandatory Palestine with the so-called Anders Army – Polish forces that formed in the Soviet Union and fought in the Middle East under the British. Ben Tov deserted in British Palestine and joined the Palmach.</p> \n<p>On April 12, 1948, Ben Tov was assigned to be a driver. Six days later he disappeared without a trace. His parents, Holocaust survivors who arrived in Israel a few months later, tried in vain to find him. “Something happened to him, but we don’t know anything,” Epstein says.</p> \n<p>Epstein discovered in army documents that Ben Tov appears as one of the dead during the attack on a large convoy heading to Jerusalem on April 20, 1948. Among the passengers were David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin. But Epstein says he found that no bodies were left behind.</p> \n<p>The question is whether Ben Tov was killed during that incident, and if not, where did he disappear to? “This isn’t an easy case, because we have no real information that he was even there,” Epstein says.</p> \n<p>What makes Ben Tov hard to locate is that he was a driver who was attached to a different unit, so the other soldiers in the convoy didn’t know him well. His parents died long ago. He was an only son and had no children of his own, making it all the harder to find out anything about him.</p> \n<p>Ben Tov is not alone. Yaakov Zrihen, who was born in Casablanca, Morocco, also disappeared as if the earth had swallowed him up. He is also listed by the army as having been killed in the same convoy as Ben Tov, but there is no evidence to back this up.</p> \n<p>Other cases Eitan is working on have been frozen for a number of reasons. One concerns a fighter pilot from Los Angeles, Robert Lester Vickman, a U.S. pilot during World War II who volunteered for the newly founded Israel Air Force during the War of Independence. On July 9, 1948, when he was 27, Vickman’s fighter crashed in or near Gaza on a mission to attack an Egyptian air base in Sinai.</p> \n<p>Even though it’s almost impossible for Israel to investigate the crash for now, Epstein isn’t giving up. “We have a lot of successes, even if they come in drips and drabs,” he says, adding that the IDF’s commitment not to leave any of the dead behind is a very real thing for him – his mission and duty.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A few months ago, when the city of Tiberias decided to construct a memorial site in honor of former minister and IDF general Rehavam Ze’evi, historian and guide Dr. Shimon Gat was incensed. “There are other people whose names are more appropriate to commemorate in Tiberias,” he wrote at the time in an email to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Among the forgotten heroes of Tiberias whom Gat named, the story of Yaakov Fadida stands out. Fadida fell in the War of Independence at age 15 and his remarkable story has never been widely told.</p> \n<p>“This youth is worthy of being commemorated in [Tiberias], but except for his family, no one remembers his deeds,” says Gat. “This young man, who volunteered to fight despite his young age, initiated actions no less noteworthy than the famous stories of heroism from 1948, there was just no one to report to the public of his courage, initiative and deeds,” Gat says.</p> \n<p>Yaakov, who was born in 1932 in Tiberias to Hannah and Machlouf Fadida, joined the ranks of the city's defenders when he served in a youth military training program while he was still in school. Then the war broke out in 1948.</p> \n<p>“Despite his young age, he wandered around among the Arabs in order to gather information, and even performed guard duty,” states the Defense Ministry’s official Yizkor website for commemorating fallen soldiers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“He took advantage of the fact that he spoke fluent Arabic in order to move around the Arab area of the lower city and collect information on the activities of the Arab soldiers there,” says Gat.</p> \n<p>Fadida’s family also tells of a few cases in which he managed to steal pistols from Arabs in Tiberias and hand them over to the Haganah, the pre-state paramilitary underground.&nbsp; “At the time, it was the biggest story in Tiberias,” says the Yizkor website.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Nahum Av, one of the commanders during the battle over Tiberias during the war, later recalled that at the beginning of the war, Fadida, who was only 14 at the time, came to him and asked to become a fighter. “Yaakov, who was short of stature, looked little for his age and so I rejected him immediately,” Av later said.</p> \n<p>“He saw his older brothers taking part in operations to liberate Tiberias and wanted to be part of it,” says Yaakov's niece, Aviya Fadida Myers. “He was a small and skinny child, not one of the giants, and at first everyone told him he shouldn’t be there.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But Fadida didn’t give up. After a day or two, he returned to try again. “He came back to me, pleaded, asked and explained that he was capable and knew how to use weapons like the big [boys],” Av recalls. “He said: ‘Try me, I’ll prove it to you.’” In an attempt to find a way out of letting the determined young man serve, Av told him he didn’t have a gun for him.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The next day Fadida came back with a pistol. “Since I heard you didn’t have enough guns on your hands, I laid an ambush at the entrance to the Arab neighborhood and when an armed Arab came by I surprised him, threatened him with a knife, and took his gun from him,” Fadida told Av. After Av took away his pistol, Fadida once again took a pistol from its Arab owner. “Having no choice, Yaakov was added to the group of fighters,” says Av.</p> \n<p>Av described one of the heroic acts attributed to little Fadida as “saving a number of fighters from certain death.” This happened when an armored bus carrying equipment to a besieged position in the city ran over a landmine. The bus caught fire and Arab fighters began shooting at the occupants.</p> \n<p>Fadida and his comrades were sitting in a nearby position and could see what was happening. The 15-year-old jumped at the chance and volunteered to help, says Av. He collected hand grenades from his fellow soldiers, climbed over the roofs of the nearby houses, approached the Arab positions, and began throwing grenades at them.</p> \n<p>“A panic broke out among the Arabs, the shooting stopped, some of them were wounded and the rest abandoned their positions and fled for their lives,” Av recounts. “When the shooting stopped, Yaakov called on our guys to come out of the burning armored [bus] and directed them . . . The armored vehicle's commander followed the orders of their little savior, and that is how they were saved from certain death.”</p> \n<p>On April 22, 1948, 70 years ago this month, Fadida was killed under circumstances that are still not completely understood during the battles over Tiberias. The Yizkor website says: “He fell under tragic circumstances from a bullet fired by mistake.”</p> \n<p>The family suffered a double tragedy when his cousin, Yehiel Fadida, a solider in the Golani infantry brigade, was killed just a day later. The two cousins were buried side by side in the military cemetery in Tiberias.</p> \n<p>Fadida was one of the youngest soldiers killed during the War of Independence.&nbsp; Younger than Fadida was 10-year-old Nissim Gini, who was killed in Jerusalem while serving as a lookout and courier. Gini entered the history books as the youngest of any soldier killed in Israel’s wars.</p> \n<p>“There were a few other youths who fell in the War of Independence, but without a doubt, Fadida was the ultimate combat soldier, whose deeds are no less [significant] than those who received the Medal of Valor (Israel’s highest military decoration),” says Gat. “But his story was completely forgotten. Who’s heard of Yaakov Fadida?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This week, as on every Memorial Day, the Fadida family will visit Yaakov’s grave and stand at attention and in silence when the nationwide siren is sounded. “Of course we remember him,” says his niece. “He was a young man who never managed to accomplish much in his life.”</p>",

Sad warmongers hijacking our nation.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Congratulations to all the war hawks and pundits and regime change propagandists who encouraged [Trump]. There is still no evidence that the [Syrian] government carried out last week’s alleged attack.&quot;</p> \n<p>Little distinguishes these two tweets' content.</p> \n<p>But the first is from conservative talk-radio host Michael Savage, and the second, from regular RT contributor and pro-Assad leftist Rania Khalek.</p> \n<p>In recent months, the crossover between leftists and the far-right in defense of Syria's tyrant and Russian geopolitics has become increasingly obvious. Its implications are potentially disastrous for the course of the international left and political society in general.</p> \n<p>Most of the stories in the media alleging that the Syrian regime's attacks on civilians are &quot;fake news&quot; have come from the conspiracist and InfoWars founder Alex Jones, and from Breitbart's London outfit, as well as the conspiracy-syncretic and far-right friendly Veterans Today, according to public scholar, Caroline O.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But left-wingers have joined the trend, finding common cause on the hard right with their blanket anti-war stance, leading Cenk Ugyur of The Young Turks to affirm the &quot;interesting agreement&quot; between right and left over Syria.</p> \n<p>Others, like Caitlin Johnstone, have called for the left &quot;to be absolutely shameless about collaborating with people on either side of the ideological divide&quot; on Syria.</p> \n<p>Leftists have found in Rupert Murdoch’s media empire a sanctuary to support Russia’s narratives. Just in terms of the past month, Glenn Greenwald joined Tucker Carlson to agree against intervention on FOX News. The Nation’s Stephen F. Cohen denied evidence in the Skripal case on a Sky News Australia program founded by far-right figure Mark Latham.</p> \n<p>Journalist Max Blumenthal went on the Rupert Murdoch-owned Australian network a week later to suggest that Syrian rebels are the most likely perpetrators of the Douma attacks.</p> \n<p>In this situation of self-parody, it becomes difficult to tell satire apart from reality.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the UK, the Labour Party is experiencing similar left-right controversies.</p> \n<p>Its leader Jeremy Corbyn’s controversial comments on the Skripal case brought widespread condemnations, Labour’s tepid response to the Douma attacks and Corbyn's rejection of any humanitarian grounds for military action led long-time fascist, Nick Griffin, to declare his intention to vote Labour.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now for some facts.</p> \n<p>The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed the UK’s account of the Russian source of the poison used against the Skripals in the UK. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the Assad regime and its allies have butchered some 85% of the more than 500,000 lives taken over the course of the civil war. The regime indisputably uses chemical weapons&nbsp;- only one of their numerous techniques for crimes against humanity. The World Health Organization and France have presented compelling evidence regarding the Douma chemical attack.</p> \n<p>Yet the Kremlin often relies on murky and unreliable sources&nbsp;linked to the &quot;anti-interventionist&quot; movement for far-fetched denials of war crimes - aided by mass trollfare.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such widespread, and politically promiscuous, attempts at denial - of genocide and crimes against humanity - are as mystifying as they are unsettling.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the Douma attacks, extreme-right activist Lyndon LaRouche blamed the UK for staging the chemical attack. Four days later, the Russia Federation’s spokesperson oddly echoed LaRouche’s charges that Britain had helped stage the attack. Regardless of whether LaRouche, who is known for his high-level Russian supporters, influenced or broadcasted the Kremlin’s narrative, the prevalence of such conspiracy theories on the left has an eerie historical resonance.</p> \n<p>For many decades, the &quot;preferred target of such theories was the Jews,&quot; notes Chip Berlet, veteran researcher of the far right, in an email, and there's a nice twist to the Kremlin's Britain-blaming: &quot;Blaming England and Jews goes back to before WWII and conspiracy theories about the Rothschilds.&quot;</p> \n<p>It would help if those contemporary &quot;hoax&quot; spinners on the left would recover even a modest historical perspective to the disastrous consequences of conspiracy thinking, and of embedding with the far right, not least in terms of modern anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Some leftists still claim Bashar al-Assad is a champion of socialism and &quot;national liberation.&quot; They appear to have conveniently forgotten how Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi, both one-time Arab world heroes of the hard left, drew &nbsp;support from the anti-Semitic hoax, the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the embrace of Nazi war criminals by Nasser, Qaddafi, and Assad’s father, Hafez&nbsp;- not to mention the Soviets’ anti-Semitic campaigns and policies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If those horror stories of left-right syncretism are too far removed from the present, some of the same groups aligned with Assad and Putin will probably recall their own defense of Slobodan Milosevic last decade, well before Russian media gave left-wing groups a platform alongside the right to support Putin’s Russia.</p> \n<p>Indeed, it is not merely those reports of alt-right members joining nominally leftist-organized anti-interventionist protests that should cause concern.</p> \n<p>High-profile members of the anti-interventionist movement include infamous conspiracy theorist, Vanessa Beeley, who has described meeting Bashar Assad in Damascus in 2016 as her &quot;proudest moment&quot;, and Navid Nasr, who uses alt-right (((echoes))) to identify Jews and boasted of his &quot;Eurasianist&quot; (read: far-right, pro-Russian hegemony) sympathies to a far-right activist.</p> \n<p>How have hard left and right come to this moment of unison? Look to the appeal of fascism.</p> \n<p>According to Israeli scholar Zeev Sternhell, fascism is composed of a syncretic agreement between the revolutionary left and ultranationalist far right to overthrow the liberal center.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy theories, which are core to both hard right and left Syria and Kremlin apologists, can serve to mystify rational contradictions, making such agreement easier.</p> \n<p>Whether or not one agrees entirely with Sternhell’s thesis, it is impossible to deny that a synthesis of conspiracy mongering amid collaboration between right and left has been showcased in recent months.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, the left seems little more than a propaganda tool in a cynical, &quot;East-versus-West&quot; geopolitical game through which the most serious economic, political, and social contradictions are ignored or obscured. The problems most people face are more complex, and the principle of equality more universal, than is realizable by authoritarian sects or creeds.</p> \n<p>The confluence of hard left authoritarians with what’s left of the alt-right around Syria and ultimately Russian geopolitics echoes a broader turn of Western political culture toward a toxic impasse that precludes the genuine solidarity that the left is supposed to champion, in its DNA.</p> \n<p>The only hope for progress lies in organized efforts to expose and debunk conspiracy theories, while promoting individual freedom and salvaging ethics from the opportunistic delusions of what British Syrian writer and activist Leila al-Shami has quite rightly called, &quot;the anti-imperialism of idiots.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Alexander Reid Ross is a Lecturer in Geography at Portland State University.

        "text":["<p>TIMNA – Around 3,200 years ago, the great empires around the Mediterranean and the Middle East suddenly imploded. The Egyptians retreated from Canaan and the copper mines of Timna in the Negev, skulking back to the banks of the Nile. And in the arid wastes of southern Canaan, a new power arose.</p> \n<p>The Timna mines were taken over by semi-nomadic tribes, which set up a mining operation that dwarfed the previous Egyptian industry.</p> \n<p>This new desert kingdom would leave its mark on the main building at Timna: the Egyptian temple of Hathor, protector of miners. The new masters smashed the effigy of the Egyptian deity – leaving the fragments to be found by archaeologists more than 3,000 years later – and set up over the ruins of the temple a tent sanctuary, judging by the remains of heavy red and yellow fabric found in the 1970s.</p> \n<p>There they worshipped a new god, one that had no apparent name or face.</p> \n<p>That miners' god was none other than the deity known by the four Hebrew letters YHWH, who would become the God of the Jews and, by extension, of Christians and Muslims, claims Nissim Amzallag, a biblical studies researcher at Ben-Gurion University.</p> \n<p>According to Amzallag, long before becoming the deity of the Israelites, Yahweh was a god of metallurgy in the ancient Canaanite pantheon, worshipped by smelters and metalworkers throughout the Levant, not just by the Hebrews. His theory is not exactly widely accepted, but has recently been gaining traction.</p> \n<p>Roughly from the 19th century, biblical scholars began looking at scripture less as records of divine revelations and more as historical and literary documents. This has led, for example, to the so-called “Documentary Hypothesis,” which considers the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, to be a compilation from multiple sources, each produced by different authors with their own beliefs and agendas.</p> \n<p>But mysteries remain: where did the YHWH cult originate? Who were the first people to worship him? And how did he end up being the sole deity of a group called Israel, who, as their very name says (in Hebrew), didn’t even start out as a Yahwistic people, but as followers of El, the main god of the Canaanite pantheon?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fire and brimstone</p> \n<p>Most scholars already believe that the cult of Yahweh first emerged somewhere in the southern Levant, partly based on Egyptian texts from the late second millennium B.C.E. These documents describe groups of Canaanite nomads collectively known as Shasu, including one tribe named Shasu Yhw(h) – perhaps the first recorded Yahweh worshippers in history.</p> \n<p>The Bible itself may contain a memory of this southern origin of Yahweh, as it tells us explicitly that God “came from Teman” (Habbakuk 3:3) or that he “went out of Seir” and “marched out of Edom” (Judges 5:4-5) – all toponyms associated with the area ranging from Sinai to the Negev and northern Arabia.</p> \n<p>“Everybody recognizes these southern origins of Yahweh, but most scholars stop there,” Amzallag says. “This forms the basis of my theory as well, but I take it a step forward.”</p> \n<p>Reading between the lines, the Bible contains clues pointing to an original identity for Yahweh as a metallurgical deity, he says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the Bible, Yahweh’s appearance is usually accompanied by volcanic-like phenomena. When he descends upon Mt. Sinai to reveal the Torah to the Jews, the mountain erupts in fire, spewing lava and billowing clouds accompanied by earthquakes and thunderstorms (Exodus 19:16-19).</p> \n<p>In antiquity, metallurgical deities like the Greek Hephaestus or his eponymous Roman equivalent, Vulcan, were associated with volcanic descriptions - which closely mirror the smoke, fire, black slag and molten red metal produced in the smelting process, Amzallag says.</p> \n<p>Poetic metaphors throughout the Bible describe Yahweh as a fiery deity who makes the mountains smoke (Psalms 144:5) and melts them down (Isaiah 63:19b), just like smelters melt down ore to obtain copper and other metals, the researcher notes. In fact, in Psalm 18:18 Yahweh is depicted as anthropomorphized furnace: “smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire&nbsp;came from his mouth, burning coals&nbsp;blazed out of it.”</p> \n<p>To ancient people, the process of melting down rocks to extract metal would have “appeared completely preternatural and required a divine explanation,” Amzallag told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Yahweh’s metallurgical attributes were also on display in the pillar of fire and smoke by which he guides the Hebrews in the desert (Exodus 13:21) and the cloud that accompanies his visits to the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:9-10), a simpler version of the Tabernacle in which Moses speaks face to face with God.</p> \n<p>The description of this tent bears remarkable similarities to the sanctuary in Timna, further suggesting that 3,000 years ago, this place may have been dedicated to the worship of Yahweh, Amzallag maintains.</p> \n<p>Yahweh, god of the Edomites?</p> \n<p>But wait a minute - the Bible and most archaeologists agree that after the collapse of the Egyptian empire in the 12th century B.C.E., Timna was taken over by the Edomites, not the Israelites. https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium-davidian-era-textiles-found-at-timna-1.5408868</p> \n<p>While the Bible goes to great lengths to describe Israel’s neighbors – such as the Edomites, the Midianites and the Moabites – as dastardly pagans, the text also betrays that Yahweh was worshipped by these nations too, possibly even before the Israelites did so, Amzallag notes. Genesis 36, for example, makes it clear that the Edomites are descendants of Esau, Jacob’s brother, and lists Edomite monarchs who ruled “before any Israelite king reigned” (Genesis 36:31).</p> \n<p>The Ammonites and Moabites are listed as descendants of Lot (Genesis 19:37-38), the nephew of Abraham and pious Yahweh-believer who escaped the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p> \n<p>In other words, the genealogies of the Bible contain the memory of an ancient confederation of Canaanite peoples, who may have considered themselves all descendants of Abraham and who all worshipped Yahweh alongside other gods, Amzallag posits.</p> \n<p>We should trust the Bible on this, he says, because its editors wouldn't have wanted to admit that the cult of Yahweh was not exclusive to Israel. &quot;So, if they reference it, it must be true,” Amzallag concludes.</p> \n<p>Further biblical evidence of this broadened base of worshippers can be found in the Book of Exodus, where a key role is played by Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, who lives near the mountain of God (alternatively called Horeb and Sinai).</p> \n<p>It is Jethro who indirectly leads Moses to his first meeting with Yahweh at the burning bush. And it is he who inaugurates the Tent of Meeting with a sacrifice and proclaims that “Yahweh is greater than all other gods” for having freed the Hebrew slaves from Egypt (Exodus 18:7-12).</p> \n<p>But Moses’ father-in-law is not an Israelite: he is described alternatively as a Midianite priest (Exodus 3:1) and a Kenite (Judges 1:16).</p> \n<p>Now, according to Bible, the Midianites were descendants of Midian, another son of Abraham, which again supports the idea of the existence of an extended family of Yahwistic peoples. The Kenites, on the other hand, are a tribe descended from Cain and described as living among all the peoples of the Levant and specializing in crafts and metalworking, which, according to Amzallag, is further evidence that Yahweh’s first incarnation was as a smelting god.</p> \n<p>Note that the so-called Midianite-Kenite hypothesis goes back to the 19th century, when biblical scholars saw Jethro’s story as evidence that these groups introduced the Israelites to the worship of Yahweh. Amzallag seems to be the first to stress the metallurgical side of this hypothesis and link Yahweh specifically to the rites and cults of ancient miners and smelters.</p> \n<p>Copper mining at Timna and at other remote sites like Faynan, today in southern Jordan, was central to the region’s economy, employing not just miners and smelters, but blacksmiths, traders and other workers in every town and village of Canaan. These people, identifiable as the biblical Kenites, would have been held in high regard and seen as being close to the divine because they possessed knowledge about the secret and mysterious process of copper smelting, Amzallag says.</p> \n<p>Or maybe the god of storms</p> \n<p>“There is no doubt that at least for the Edomites, and possibly for their neighbors, religion had to go hand in hand with what was their most important activity,” says Erez Ben-Yosef, an archaeologist from Tel Aviv University who leads a team excavating at Timna. “They depended on the success of these operations and they definitely would have felt they needed the help of a god in the complex smelting process and in organizing these mining expeditions to distant, arid areas.”</p> \n<p>We have no direct proof that the metallurgical god, worshipped at the Edomite sanctuary in Timna from the 12th to the 10th century B.C.E., was Yahweh: there is no inscription invoking his name. But the kinship described in the Bible between the Israelites and the Edomites, and the metallurgical attributes of Yahweh in the holy text, are “compelling arguments” supporting Amzallag’s theory that this god was worshipped by multiple peoples as a deity connected to metallurgy, Ben-Yosef concludes.</p> \n<p>There are skeptics.</p> \n<p>“The theory is interesting but I don’t think there is enough evidence to say that the first worshippers of Yahweh were metallurgists,” says Thomas Romer, a world-renowned expert in the Hebrew Bible and a professor at the College de France and the University of Lausanne. There is strong evidence connecting the Israelites and the Edomites, and maybe the latter worshipped Yahweh as well, says Romer, author of “The Invention of God,” a book about the history of Yahweh and the biblical text.</p> \n<p>However, Romer disagrees with Amzallag’s interpretation of the supposed volcanic phenomena described in the Bible. He thinks they are more indicative of a god of storms and fertility, similar to the Canaanite god Baal.</p> \n<p>“It is quite common for storm gods in antiquity to make the mountains tremble, but is this really an allusion to volcanism or is it just showing the power of the god?” Romer says.</p> \n<p>Iron trumps bronze</p> \n<p>If, and that’s a big if, Amzallag’s theory is correct, a niggling question remains: how did this smelting god, worshipped by the semi-nomadic peoples all over the southern Levant become the solitary national deity of just one of these nations, the Israelites?</p> \n<p>That may have had to do with the rise of the Iron Age, Amzallag says. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, two relatively rare elements. Iron is much easier to find and just needs to be combined with another common element, carbon, to produce one of the strongest metals known to man: steel.</p> \n<p>By the 9th century B.C.E., copper production at Timna and the rest of the Levant had all but shut down and the process of smelting had lost much of its mystique. In the Iron Age, Mediterranean metal workers lost their elite status and were simply seen as skilled craftsmen rather than quasi-priests or magicians.</p> \n<p>In parallel, their gods either lost their importance in the local pantheon and were forgotten, or were transformed, acquiring different attributes and characteristics, Amzallag says. Meanwhile, the loose coalition of Canaanite nomadic tribes who once saw themselves as descendants of the same patriarch, had morphed into a patchwork of small, centralized kingdoms, each vying for the status of regional power. Conflict became inevitable, and indeed the Bible is filled with stories of wars between the Israelites and their neighbors, who are invariably depicted as evil.</p> \n<p>As each nation attempted to gain political and military supremacy over the other, the Israelites may have also tried to establish their spiritual superiority, depicting themselves as favored children of a powerful god, or, to use a biblical turn of phrase - a Chosen People.</p> \n<p>“To gain primacy and become the chosen people of God, they had to remove the metallurgical origins of Yahwism and disconnect him from the other nations,” says Amzallag. But while weeding out explicit mentions of Yahweh’s roots, the editors of the Bible could not completely ignore the traditions and stories that were already an integral part of the identity of this cult, he suggests.</p> \n<p>Yahweh’s fiery attributes or the stories of a shared Abrahamic origin for the peoples of the Levant are echoes of more ancient beliefs, he says, clues that remind us that “once there was no exclusive connection between God and Israel. Initially, God belonged to all.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The failure of the Assyrian king Sennacherib to capture Jerusalem is one of the more baffling events recorded in the Bible. Even the ancients couldn't explain why the Assyrians, who had rolled over the region and were known for their might and cruelty, did not crush the Judahite capital and kill its king, Hezekiah. What happened 2,700 years ago?</p> \n<p>The only source of information on biblical times, the bible aside, is Assyrian and Egyptian records. On the upside, the extra-biblical records were usually contemporary to the actual events. On the downside, they may have been as colored by propaganda as scripture is by religion. To elucidate what happened when the Assyrians besieged Jerusalem, it's worth cross-checking all these sources.</p> \n<p>All these sources agree that by the time Jerusalem and Hezekiah faced the Assyrian battalions in 701 B.C.E., the Assyrians already controlled much of the Near East, but after some of the local kings had ceased paying their annual tribute, King Sennacherib's forces swept westward to re-assert control and bring them to heel. City after city along the Phoenician coast fell. Frightened kings hastened to submissively send tribute. Recalcitrant cities such as Ashkelon were taken by force. Then the Assyrians reached Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The weird thing is that they accepted tribute, left, and let Hezekiah, no toady of Assyria, live. Almost three millennia later, people are still arguing how that came to pass.</p> \n<p>Sennacherib attacks</p> \n<p>When Sennacherib came to power in 705 B.C.E., he inherited an empire in flames.</p> \n<p>Under his father Sargon II, the Assyrian army had been beaten back by rebels in Tabal, today central Turkey. Following Sargon's II's death that year, civil unrest spread like wildfire inside the empire.</p> \n<p>To consolidate his rule, Sennacherib went campaigning. First he secured his rear, vanquishing unrest. That done, in 701 B.C.E. Sennacherib embarked on what he called his &quot;third campaign.&quot; His first objective in the westward drive was to secure Phoenicia. Most of the coastal cities surrendered at the mere sight of his forces.</p> \n<p>But not all kings surrendered and offered tribute. The rulers of Ekron, Gaza and King Hezekiah of Judah balked.</p> \n<p>The Hebrew sources for what ensued are 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Micah, and Isaiah. We also have the annals of Sennacherib; reliefs found in the Assyrian city of Nineveh (Iraq) and remains of a siege found in Lachish (Israel); Herodotus, the Greek historian who lived in the 5th century B.C.E., and 600 years later, the Jewish-Roman historian Josephus.</p> \n<p>A very badly frightened king</p> \n<p>The Assyrians describe Sennacherib's third campaign in the Annals of Sennacherib and the Rassam Cylinder, a ten-sided artifact 49 centimeters in height found in Nineveh and written in cuneiform, which among other things gloats about plunder taken during the campaign. The Assyrian sources are the oldest and most contemporary historical record of the campaign: the earliest, the Rassam cylinder dates to 700 B.C.E. other versions of Sennacherib's annals dates to 694-689 B.C.E.</p> \n<p>There are some holes in the Assyrian tale. The Assyrians say Jaffa was part of the Ashkelon kingdom, but the two cities were far apart and Ashdod – run by a different king altogether - lay between them. Finally, the Assyrians claimed to have taken 200,150 captives from Judah, which sounds a tad far-fetched.</p> \n<p>Of course, the purpose of ancient record-keeping was not accuracy per se, but to convey a message. In this case: Backed by the god Ashur, the Assyrian king overpowered rebels and subdued Judah (Israel had already become part of the Assyrian provincial system under Sargon in 720 BCE); kings who refused to bow before them were ousted, and replaced with vassal kings. Rebellious leaders were punished horribly. On the Judahite king:</p> \n<p>&quot;[Hezekiah] I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage&quot;&nbsp; (Translated from the annals of Sennacherib by Mordechai Cogan, The Raging Torrent 125, 2nd edition, Jerusalem 2018).</p> \n<p>The Assyrians portrayed King Hezekiah of Jerusalem, a principal enemy, as a coward quailing before the Assyrian might, as toothless as his god Yahweh, who failed to prevent the Assyrians from capturing 46 of his strongholds. Sennacherib sneered that Yahweh would prove to be as impotent as the gods of other lands that had already fallen (2 Kings 18:17-35, Isaiah 36:2-3).</p> \n<p>Among Sennacherib's victories was the powerful Judahic city of Lachish. Apparently cowed by the loss of Lachish, &quot;caged&quot; Hezekiah delivered a vast ransom: 30 talents of gold, worth $2 million today, silver (the Assyrians say 800 talents, the Bible says 300 – which would have been worth around $11 million), luxury items – and his daughters and women.</p> \n<p>In the terms of the time, that meant the gods of Assyria were mightier than the neighbors'. The Judahic version naturally cast the sparing of Jerusalem in a different light, as a proactive deed of the deity: Yahweh sent an angel who struck down 185,000 Assyrians in a single night, and Sennacherib fled (2 Kings 19:35-37. Isaiah 37:33-37. 2 Chronicles 32:21).</p> \n<p>&quot;this is what Jehovah says about the king of Assyria: He will not come into this city, Or shoot an arrow there, Or confront it with a shield, Or cast up a siege rampart against it&quot; – 2 Kings 19:32</p> \n<p>Up against god himself</p> \n<p>After the fall of Lachish, Hezekiah pays the tribute demanded by Sennacherib (2 Kings 18:14-16) Ergo, Sennacherib continued to assail Judah after its king had capitulated (2 Kings 19:8-9). Why would the Assyrian king do that?</p> \n<p>The people of Judah angered Jehovah by worshipping Baal, bringing divine vengeance upon their heads (2 King 17:16-17). Assyria was merely Yahweh's rod to administer that discipline:</p> \n<p>“The Assyrian, the rod to express my anger and the staff in their hand for my denunciation!” – Isaiah 10:5</p> \n<p>And that, dear reader, could explain why Sennacherib, after taking the tribute from Hezekiah, continued to attack Judah. Yahweh made him do it.</p> \n<p>In that light, King Hezekiah's efforts to fight bolster Jerusalem's defenses, to forge military alliances against the Assyrians and finally, to buy them off, were foredoomed: only Yahweh could settle the score with the Assyrians.</p> \n<p>But Yahweh did that very thing too, according to the Bible.</p> \n<p>Angel vs. bacteria</p> \n<p>The Bible also says 185,000 Assyrian soldiers died in one night while besieging Jerusalem. That decidedly beefy number could stem from misinterpretation of the original Hebrew. Or, did Yahweh get involved after all on the Judahic side as well?</p> \n<p>Divine intervention in and of itself is a theme in the Old Testament (Exodus 11:4-12:29, 2 Samuel 24:15-17). The Prophet Samuel describes an angel bringing pestilence against the Israelites. Some scholars think &quot;angel of god&quot; is biblical euphemism for &quot;epidemic&quot;. Others simply dismiss the verse as purely theological, and unhistorical.</p> \n<p>Alan Millard, emeritus professor of Hebrew and Ancient Semitic languages at Liverpool University, thinks that scholars who simply dismiss the account as purely theological, are simply ignorant of the attitudes of ancient people.</p> \n<p>“Assyrian and other royal inscriptions do ascribe the unexpected to divine intervention, even when we might say it was ‘just the weather’. An Egyptian pharaoh said the god Amun overruled the winter weather that might have prevented a princess from the Hittites in Turkey from reaching Egypt. Ashurbanipal, Sennacherib’s grandson, told of fire falling from heaven at the command of the god Assur to destroy an invading army,” he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>By and large the biblical and Assyrian accounts harmonize on many core events. Crucially, both accounts agree that Sennacherib did conquer Lachish, and overran almost all of Judah but not Jerusalem. Leaving gods out of it, there could be other explanations for Jerusalem and Hezekiah's survival. Such as, mice.</p> \n<p>The Jewish historian, Josephus, writing in the 1st century C.E., later connected the dots:</p> \n<p>“When Senacheirimos returned to Jerusalem from his war with Egypt, he found there the force under Rapsakes in danger from a plague, for God had visited a pestilential sickness upon his army, and on the first night of the siege one hundred and eighty-five thousand men had perished with their commanders and officers”&nbsp; - Jospehus, Ja. 10.17.21</p> \n<p>Something terrible happened to the terrible Assyrians as they camped outside the Jerusalem walls, resulting in their defeat.</p> \n<p>Something terrible also happened to the Assyrians in Egypt, according to Herodotus:</p> \n<p>&quot;During the night a horde of field mice gnawed quivers and their bows and the handles of shields, with the result that many were killed, fleeing unarmed the next day&quot; - Herodotus 2.141</p> \n<p>Herodotus, who lived in the 5th&nbsp;century B.C.E., tells that Sennacherib marched to Egypt with a force of Arabians and Assyrians. The Egyptian soldiers were petrified but the god Ptah visited the king and priest, Sethon, in a dream and promised he would prevail. Heartened by the divine vision, Sethon gathered a band of merchants, craftsmen and traders and camped at Pelusium, a city in the Nila Delta, to face Sennacherib. They won, the Assyrians lost.</p> \n<p>That bit about omitting soldiers and bringing along tradespeople could be ancient hyperbole for &quot;look how we weak defeated the strong,&quot; and if anything, supports belief that some battle really did happen.</p> \n<p>It's also plausible that mice could bring down an army. If 185,000 Assyrians suddenly upped and died, mouse-born plague is a possibility. But that was in Jerusalem and Herodotus is describing the Egyptian defeat.</p> \n<p>Possibly two stories of two different Assyrian humiliations – in Jerusalem and Egypt – became confused over the centuries. It seems implausible that the mighty warriors were brought to their knees time and again by loquat-sized rodents.</p> \n<p>Something fishy in the state of Judah</p> \n<p>There is a common thread in the Assyrian, biblical and Herodotus' accounts: divine intervention in the affairs of mortals. Sennacherib's annals talk of &quot;the utter dread&quot; of the weapon wielded by their god Ashur.</p> \n<p>The Assyrians do not specify what kind of weapon Ashur used. Herodotus and the Bible are clearer on this point: Yahweh's weapon was an angel of death.</p> \n<p>To the ancients, the gods ruled the world and settled the affairs of men. The ancient kings and priests mediated with the invisible higher powers on behalf of the people. Thus the personal annals of kings gave credit, or justified their actions, in the name of the gods.</p> \n<p>Theoretically, the Assyrian account should be more reliable on Sennacherib's campaign into Judah, because it is contemporary and should theoretically be more accurate; also Herodotus' and the biblical accounts incorporated diverse material from various ages and origins and are therefore less credible. But though contemporary, the Assyrian account was as god-struck and saturated with propaganda as anybody else's.</p> \n<p>Writers of yore weren't fussed about a story being &quot;true.&quot; A chronicler would say King A conquered a city and King B was defeated. A royal annalist would say that King B offended God and therefore was punished by allowing King A to seize his city.</p> \n<p>Throughout Sennacherib's drive into the Levant, the Assyrians' clear-cut policy was to quash rebellious kings and replace them with loyalists. The Assyrians were infamous through the ancient world for their cruelty. Warrior monarch Ashurnasirpal describes:</p> \n<p>“I built a pillar over against his city gate, and I flayed all the chief men who had revolted, and I covered the pillar with their skins; some I walled up within the pillar, some I impaled upon the pillar on stakes, . . . and I cut off the limbs of the officers, of the royal officers who had rebelled. . . . </p> \n<p>&quot;Many captives from among them I burned with fire, and many I took as living captives. From some I cut off their hands and their fingers, and from others I cut off their noses, their ears, and their fingers(?), of many I put out the eyes. I made one pillar of the living, and another of heads, and I bound their heads to posts (tree trunks) round about the city. Their young men and maidens I burned in the fire . . . Twenty men I captured alive and I immured them in the wall of his palace. . . . The rest of them [their warriors] I consumed with thirst in the desert of the Euphrates.” ––&nbsp;Translated by Daniel .D. Luckenbill, Ancient records of Assyria and Babylonia, Chicago</p> \n<p>No wonder people were terrified of them and resistance would crumble. No wonder the Phoenician coastal cities surrendered without hesitation at the mere sight of the Assyrians; no wonder the Phoenician king fled overseas.</p> \n<p>No wonder Hezekiah instantly paid heavy tribute after Lachish fell.</p> \n<p>Since Assyrians were not famed for having a live-and-let-go policy for their enemies, questions emerge about what on earth happened in the Judah campaign.</p> \n<p>Why did Sennacherib change policy? Why didn't he dethrone the rebellious king Hezekiah and replace him with a loyal subject? Why wasn't Jerusalem captured like the other capital cities?</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, it had to be that murine or other calamity struck the Assyrian camp and the Assyrians had to break off the campaign (Herodotus 2, 2 Kings 19:35-37, Isaiah 37:33-37, 2 Chronicles 32:21). That is the only feasible explanation why the Assyrians didn't conquer Jerusalem. They were simply incapable.</p> \n<p>To deliberately show leniency to rebels would have made Sennacherib look weak, resulting in more uprisings.</p> \n<p>Sins of the father</p> \n<p>However, that Jerusalem rout must have been a hideous embarrassment, which leads us to the seemingly unrelated fact that the Assyrian palace in Nineveh has inscriptions boasting about the victory at Lachish, while the annals omit the whole thing. Now let's connect some dots.</p> \n<p>It was not the custom of the Assyrians to record their defeats on the palace walls of Nineveh. Defeat indicated divine disapproval. Sargon's sudden death in Cappadocia (Turkey) was viewed as a bad omen, a divine punishment, throughout all of the Assyrian Empire, resulting in uprisings.</p> \n<p>Sennacherib knew this and went to great pains to overcome the sins of his father. One measure was to abandon the capital city Sargon built at Khorsabad and commission a new palace at Nineveh.</p> \n<p>The vast palace Sennacherib erected in Nineveh covered an area 450 meters by 210 meters. Among other things it portrayed taking spoils from Lachish:</p> \n<p>Sennacherib, king of the universe, king of Assyria, seated upon a armchair; the spoils of Lachish passed before him”-–&nbsp;Mordechai Cogan, The Raging Torrent 135 (2nd edition, Jerusalem 2018)</p> \n<p>Every foreign or domestic dignitary seeking audience with the king would have seen the relief. Why? Because it showed that the campaign into Judah hadn't been a complete fiasco.</p> \n<p>The Assyrians were not above altering historical records as expedient. Sennacherib's sixth campaign against the Elamites is recorded as victorious, but he omits mentioning that right afterwards the Elamite king struck back, venturing as far as Babylon and capturing the Assyrian viceroy.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the unsuccessful capture of Jerusalem was recorded boastfully, describing the 200,150 prisoners and talents of silver and gold: 300 silver talents would have been worth almost $2 million in today's tender, and 30 gold talents were worth nearly $12 million. One wonders again about veracity: where would Hezekiah have taken huge sums like that, if the Temple was laid bare every time a foreign army drew near (2 Kings 12:18,16:8; 2 Chronicles 16:2,3).</p> \n<p>At the end of the day, all accounts – the Assyrians, the Bible, and Herodotus, interpreted events. They didn't invent them.</p> \n<p>Something unexpected happened to the Assyrian army, which the people of the ancient Near East attributed to divine meddling.</p> \n<p>The ancient kings had to keep their subjects and gods happy and propaganda was the most effective way to distort history and cover up failure. Sennacherib's failure to conquer Jerusalem was embarrassing and was over-compensated by grand reliefs on palace walls and extravagant claims of plunder. The fact that one of the main instigators of the Assyrian rebellion, Hezekiah, remained on the throne, albeit denuded of his wealth and women, may say it all.</p>",

Kandel pointed to the shortage of high-tech professionals and said the industry was too reliant on a small segment of the population for human resources. “The percentage of Arabs in high-tech today is just 1.4%, even though their share of the workforce is 17%,” Kandel said. Aharon Aharon, CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, expressed concern that the percentage of the Israeli labor force in tech has been stuck at 8.3% for the last decade and that this figure can only increase by recruiting women, ultra-Orthodox Jews as well as Israeli Arabs.

They have injured more protestors than Gaza has hospital beds. Medecins Sans Frontieres has noted an alarming pattern among the gunshot wounds, indicating a particularly harmful choice of ammunition. No Israeli has been injured or killed.</p> \n<p>You ask whether a person who observes these facts would like to see &quot;a hundred Jewish bodies strewn across the desert.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No, I would not. I am simply observing a fact. I am not seeking more deaths; I am seeking fewer. I am calling attention to avoidable killing. If I may not note the factual distribution of death, then what am I allowed to say?</p> \n<p>We think in proportions, and International Humanitarian Law is based partly on the pillar of proportionality. During the 2014 onslaught in Gaza, 18,000 Gazans' homes and one Israeli home were severely damaged or destroyed. 550 Gazan children and one Israeli child died.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Why So Many Israelis Won't Condemn the Carnage in Gaza&nbsp;| Opinion |&nbsp;From Jerusalem to Gaza: The Bloodstained First Act of the Trump Intifada&nbsp;| Opinion |&nbsp;Israel’s Gaza Killings: War Crimes or Self-defense?&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Those ratios indicate that terms like &quot;war&quot; poorly describe the nature of the violence that Gazans experience. &quot;War&quot; suggests a reciprocal violence, tempered by mutual mortal risk. In Gaza, the violence, the mortal risk, and the damage are so one-sided that different language is needed to convey it.</p> \n<p>The actual ratios of loss convey that one side holds overwhelming power, and the other side lives with overwhelming threat. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>You suggest that commentators would better understand the appropriateness of these arrangements if they could imagine being a &quot;resident of a town near Gaza.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hmm. Maybe they are imagining being a resident of Gaza.</p> \n<p>From America, you find persistent observations of disproportion &quot;infuriating.&quot; In Gaza, disproportion is death, and that may be what infuriates the commentators.</p> \n<p>You write that the IDF’s &quot;shoot-to-kill [instruction] was...an absolute last resort.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No, Rabbi Yoffie, the Gaza protests are the last resort. After eleven years of blockade, throwing a rock toward lethally-armed soldiers is a last resort.</p> \n<p>On the field of protest, you are confusing Gaza and Hamas. Behind Gaza’s blockade wall, a community of two million people live in conditions you would not accept for yourself. Each time you slip in &quot;Hamas&quot; as a proxy for the community or the crowd of protestors, you militarize the space and excuse Israel’s violent, collective response to the people in that space, aged eight months and older.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I would not expect you to passively submit to the life behind Gaza’s blockade walls, and I know you would not be content to raise your children in Gaza’s conditions. You would protest.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Your column invokes the &quot;prayers of [American] civil rights leaders that their children not be harmed.&quot; Why is it hard for you to see that Gazan parents say the same prayer? This very prayer is driving people to risk being killed for the crime of Walking While Gazan.</p> \n<p>I am mystified than you are unable to see political agency, or human desperation, in these protests.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When I lived in Gaza, I used to imagine two million unarmed Gazans, walking out. This season, I shared those hopes with others who have advocated mass non-violent protest. &nbsp;I skyped with Gazan friends about their hopes – and then I saw the scores of killings alongside the spectacle of Trump’s triumphal Israel.</p> \n<p>As a Jew, this week of Jewish nationalism has left me in despair.</p> \n<p>I have never written in support of Hamas. I have observed that the blockade walls feed the rage that feeds the militants. But Hamas is not Gaza. The existence of Hamas does not give Israel pretext for shooting and killing unarmed demonstrators.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Yoffie, no language can make the blockade of Gaza legal or ethically tolerable. Language cannot not alter the grossly disproportionate suffering, which is caused primarily by Israel’s policy choices. No language can erase the visible fact of Israeli soldiers, drones, an air force and a blockade slowly choking the breath out of a community of two million people.</p> \n<p>Eventually, every Jew will have to ask themselves, &quot;What am I going to believe, this language or the world in front of my eyes?&quot;</p> \n<p>May this week prompt more of us to reject the language that dehumanizes Gaza and its people and butresses the blockade walls.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Marilyn Garson lived and worked in Gaza 2011 – 2015.&nbsp; She writes from New Zealand.

        "text":["<p>On the morning of Tuesday, March 13, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman was at the Home Front Command's situation room, along with military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot and Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, the command's chief. The three were closely following a drill to test how prepared the Home Front is for emergencies.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel - subscribe to Haaretz&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This was already a tense morning, but especially so for the defense minister. There were rumors at the time that Netanyahu was planning to call early elections, and just a night earlier a poll showed that Lieberman's party, Yisrael Beiteinu, would drop to only four seats in the Knesset – even less than the practically non-existent party of Orly Levy-Abekasis, formerly a member of Lieberman's party.</p> \n<p>The threat of elections has since passed, but after two years on the job, Lieberman is finding it hard to claim any achievement that could be translated into votes in the elections to come. Even during the past week, achievements by the defense establishment are being credited to the man who appointed him, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Only two years ago, however, it seemed that things were different. When Lieberman replaced Moshe Ya'alon as defense minister, he had the hawkish image of a politician tough on security matters. He suggested bombing Egypt's Aswan Dam, told former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to &quot;go to hell&quot; and made a vow that still haunts him: to &quot;eliminate&quot; Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh within 48 hours if the bodies of Israeli soldiers held in Gaza would not be returned.</p> \n<p>But as defense minister, Lieberman is showing restraint, accepting almost in full the Israel Defense Forces' moderate approach, and is in no rush to go on military adventures behind enemy lines. Defense and political sources give the downing of an Israeli F-16 by Syrian air defenses in February as an example for a situation in which Lieberman chose the more moderate of the options for response that were presented to him.</p> \n<p>Some say that Lieberman, a veteran politician, is aware that one knows how war starts, but not how it ends. Others say that his lack of military and security experience is so great, he doesn’t have a choice but to agree with the military’s moderate line. However, he still wishes to leave a mark.</p> \n<p>Lieberman, who wants a pet project of his own, seeks to establish a new “missile corps.” His vision, according to a February report in Yedioth Ahronoth, is of a force consisting of mid-range ballistic missiles with a range of up to 300 kilometers that would cost 500 million shekels ($140 million). The new force is slated to become operational in two years.</p> \n<p>But Lieberman’s idea is not really his, and not really new. In 1996, Maj. Gen. Israel Tal introduced the idea to Netanyahu during his first term in office, and it has been brought up a number of times since. But there’s a reason why it wasn’t advanced: The defense establishement opposes it. It’s unclear if Israel would require such a force in case a violent conflict breaks out, and some prefer spending the budget allocated to it on other, more urgent needs.</p> \n<p>“I don’t see a need for the establishment of a missile corps,” army chief Gadi Eisenkot told Haaretz in an interview a few months ago. “The IDF today is in possession of an impressive missile array through the air force, the navy and the ground corps. The IDF has one of the most advanced missile capacities in the world, one that no other military in the region has.”</p> \n<p>Eisenkot addressed the issue after it came up a few times in the media as well as in cabinet meetings, and was resolute in his stance. “No one is talking about setting up a missile corps at this stage,” he said. A discussion on the matter in not off the table, though – quite the opposite in fact. “It’s important and not everyone is opposed to the plan,” says a senior security source who is well versed in the topic. But according to the official, the discussions that Lieberman leads on the subject are superficial. It’s obvious to everyone that he’s trying to leave his post with at least one achievement. He’s looking for something that will be named after him. There is no serious discussion about whether such a corps would change the IDF’s perception of wartime operations.”</p> \n<p>Another source familiar with discussions on the matter told Haaretz that this would be an expansive system that would go unused, and the cost alone of maintaining it would burden the army. “It could be that Lieberman wholeheartedly believes in this project,” he added, “but you can’t ignore his motives and the speed at which he is trying to achieve something so significant.”</p> \n<p>Always late</p> \n<p>This is not the first time that Lieberman faces claims about failing to discuss issues in depth. Political and security sources tend to note that conversations with the defense minister are brief and superficial, and some have called him “lazy.” According to them, he would leave mid-discussion, show up late, appear to be unfamiliar with details and “never as a defense minister does he lead the most sensitive discussions.”</p> \n<p>One senior political source says Lieberman “is almost transparent in the cabinet. Even to an unusual extent.” Another source says that when the defense minister does participate in discussions, “Lieberman often refers to topics such as different military arenas or ammunition, while army personnel stand there embarrassed as they are forced to contradict him or explain what he really means.”</p> \n<p>A source familiar with affairs at the Defense Ministry says that when Lieberman entered his post, his predecessor Ya’alon suggested they put their personal disagreements aside so he could show Lieberman the ropes. “There was one meeting between them that lasted an hour and a half to two hours,” the source recollects. “Nothing much was said in that talk. How much can you learn about the Defense Ministry in an hour and a half, especially when it comes from someone who doesn’t have a background in security.”</p> \n<p>Lieberman’s associates claim that another hour-long meeting took place after that, but the source says that “even if there was another, longer meeting – and I doubt that there was – it would still be less than the time invested in training a waitress for the job.”</p> \n<p>The upcoming war</p> \n<p>All this did not hold Lieberman back from stating in the cabinet in an almost methodical manner – even on his first days on the job – that he can see war breaking out within the upcoming year. He did it “without any intelligence assessment attesting to that,” a senior political source says. “It’s clear to everyone that this is the first tip he got when he started the job in order to prepare him for an investigative committee should he ever have to face one. Lieberman knows that it’s always good to have protocols that show he sounded a warning.”</p> \n<p>In one cabinet meeting, Eisenkot was requested to comment on such assessments by the defense minister. “The army is always preparing for a situation when a war could break out, this is the IDF’s working assumption at any given moment,” the chief of staff said, but added: “We don’t see that any of our enemies are particularly interested in setting out on a war.”</p> \n<p>Asides from the embarrassment members of the security establishment seem to feel when Lieberman speaks at cabinet discussions, the defense minister also causes embarrassment with his public statements. Such was the case last month after Palestinian journalist Yaser Murtaja was shot to death in Gaza. Lieberman accused Murtaja at the time of operating a drone, but according to the army, no such aircraft was activated on that day. The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit chose to refrain from commenting on the subject.</p> \n<p>Six months earlier a different incident took place; the defense minister claimed that the Israeli side of the Golan Heights was fired at following the instruction of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nassrallah and was not a result of errant fire spilling into Israeli territory from the fighting in Syria. The security establishment, however, struggled to corroborate this statement.</p> \n<p>But it doesn’t stop there. There was also Lieberman’s attempt to prevent Palestinians from participating in a joint Israeli-Palestinian memorial day ceremony over the reasoning that they are actually terrorists;&nbsp;Lieberman’s decision to recommend to grant Hebron shooter Elor Azaria clemency – in opposition to the positions of the chief of staff and the military prosecution – and the ban on Israeli poet and singer Yehonatan Geffen to go on Army Radio over the artist’s political statements and other statements he made that embarrassed the security establishment.</p> \n<p>One of the most famous examples of Lieberman’s controversial statements was given last February, when it was published that Eisenkot warned of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza that could draw Israel into a confrontation with the Palestinians. Here, too, Lieberman made sure to present his side and claimed to the media the next morning that “the situation in Gaza is difficult, but there’s no humanitarian crisis.” Figures in the security establishment claim that the defense minister also forbade the military to use the term “humanitarian crisis” when referring to Gaza in interviews and in statements to the press.</p> \n<p>Not the adult in charge</p> \n<p>The division between Lieberman and the security establishment runs still deeper than that. Security and political sources who partake in sensitive forums claim that when it comes to delicate issues, the person perceived as the adult in charge is the prime minister and not the defense minister. “Bibi leads the discussions even on topics that Lieberman is responsible for and Bibi is also the one to claim the responsibility,” a senior political source claims.</p> \n<p>Such was the case when a fighter jet was downed in March. A seemingly unusual image was detected at the situation room in the IDF headquarters: Netanyahu, the commander of the air force and the army chief were all seen sitting at the front of the table, and the defense minister was situated all the way over at the back. He was a minor partner in the management and decision making surrounding the affair. “He was sitting quietly most of the time,” a person familiar with the details revealed.</p> \n<p>A former senior defense official says that it is not necessarily unusual for the prime minister to claim the responsibility in such cases. “But in [Ehud] Barak or [Moshe] Ya’alon’s case it was hard not to hear them making their assessment, their case was heard. In Lieberman’s case, you can’t ignore the fact that Bibi is also the de facto defense minister.”</p> \n<p>Further proof of that was given in the beginning of May when Netanyahu revealed materials Israel had gathered on Iran’s nuclear program. Lieberman returned from a tour in the U.S. that day, and when he disembarked from the plane at Ben-Gurion International Airport he rushed to his home – not to the cabinet or discussions with heads of the security establishment. In the security establishment, however, it is said that talks assessing the situation at the time were held over the phone, and only later did they happen face to face.</p> \n<p>One way or another, it seems that even if Lieberman is trying to convey that it’s business as usual, he is aware of the problematic situation he is. “He understands well that votes aren’t going to come from decisions he made while functioning as the defense minister,” a political source says. “Netanyahu won’t let him take the credit.”</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, Lieberman is still trying to make the most of the senior job he wanted so badly. He also tends to consult with former senior officers, among them major generals. One such adviser told Haaretz that despite Lieberman’s lack of previous knowledge, he succeeds in bringing an added value to the security establishment. “He learns quickly and he has this line that he leads,” the ex-officer explains. “Don’t forget that Lieberman understands the Russians. This is an immense advantage that is being used; he knows how to talk to Putin, he gets the environment.”</p> \n<p>But even on this topic, things are more complicated than they seem. Despite the fact that Lieberman confers with the Russian defense minister and other officials, he isn’t perceived by Netanyahu as the senior authority representing the country in Moscow. His official point of contact for such needs is Environmental Protection Minister Ze'ev Elkin. Elkin joined almost all of Netanyahu’s trips to Russia for meetings with Vladimir Putin and was present during phone calls between Jerusalem and Moscow.</p> \n<p>The defense minister’s office responded: “We are distressed by this political, tendentious and desperate attempt to create a misrepresentation that has no bearing in reality. The results speak for themselves, day after day and hour by hour, primarily as a result of the cooperation between the defense minister, the chief of staff and the IDF’s top brass. Israel’s defense policy continues to be strong, determined and responsible, even if it does not fit in with the political viewpoint of one person or another.”</p> \n<p>The IDF Spokesperson’s Unit stated that “among senior members of the IDF there is a professional and open relationship that enables the army to carry out the multiple tasks that the security establishment is facing, in the best way possible. Actions, results and plans that are being carried out one after the other, that is the most important thing. We suggest not to let half-statements by people with interests replace practicality with gossip. The results in all fields of work speak for themselves.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>New evidence from four Israeli hospitals indicates that maternity wards place Jewish and Arab women in separate rooms on their own initiative, not only at the expectant mothers’ request.</p> \n<p>“We generally arrange this automatically,” a representative of Haemek Hospital in Afula told a pregnant woman who inquired about the hospital’s policy in a conversation that she recorded.</p> \n<p>“We try to arrange separate rooms because the culture and visiting times are really different,” said a nurse in the hospital. “You feel very intensely that there’s one person and there’s a clan. We try, we can’t say 100 percent, but on days that there’s no pressure, we arrange separate accommodations [for people speaking] different languages.”</p> \n<p>This and other recordings are part of the testimonies of four Arab women who gave birth and were roomed separately from Jewish women at Hadassah University Hospital, Mt. Scopus in Jerusalem; Haemek in Afula; Nahariya’s Western Galilee Hospital in and Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva. The women filed a class action Wednesday against the long-standing practice, which they call discriminatory.</p> \n<p>More than a decade after the practice was exposed in a number of investigative reports, causing a public storm, Arab women say it has not ended and that the Health Ministry continues to turn a blind eye. In the class-action, filed by lawyers Nadav Miara and Gil Ron of Gil Ron Kenan &amp; Co., in cooperation with the Class Action Clinic of the Tel Aviv University law school, the four are demanding that hospitals prohibit such segregation and pay significant compensation to anyone offended by the policy, in the hope that hitting hospitals in their pockets will finally lead to change.</p> \n<p>“The subject of segregation in maternity wards has been in the headlines for a long time; it was in the Knesset, it was in the press, it’s not something new,” said Prof. Alon Klement, Israel’s most prominent class-action attorney and the clinic’s academic supervisor.</p> \n<p>“The Class Action Clinic spoke with dozens of women to determination the extent of this segregation. Our research showed that things haven’t changed sufficiently, and there is still blatant segregation in the hospitals. We spoke to women who were made to feel terrible by the experience. The four plaintiffs signed on the suit were willing to stand up and represent an entire group because it is so important to them,” Klement said.</p> \n<p>He estimates that thousands of Arab women have been segregated from Jewish ones in this fashion over the past seven years (earlier cases are subject to a statute of limitations).</p> \n<p>Rana (a pseudonym), a social worker who lives in Jerusalem, had her three children at Hadassah on Mount Scopus. She became aware of the separation policy in 2009, when she gave birth to her second daughter.</p> \n<p>“After the birth I was transferred to the maternity ward and was hospitalized in a room with two other Arab mothers,” she recalls in her affidavit. “When one of my roommates was discharged, an Arab woman replaced her, which aroused my suspicions. As I looked through the rooms on the ward, I saw the segregation — Arab mothers were placed separately, not with Jewish mothers.”</p> \n<p>When Rana wrote a complaint letter, a nurse came to her room and explained that the separation was done out of “social sensitivity” and was also in the best interests of the Arab women. “I was not convinced,” wrote Rana. “I felt that this was an excuse for racial segregation.”</p> \n<p>In the winter of 2017, Rana returned to Hadassah to give birth to her third child. “This time I was also in a room with only Arab women,” she wrote. Each Arab woman who was discharged was replaced by another Arab woman. “I felt humiliated, I was offended,” she concluded.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, an investigative report by Israel Radio brought testimonies of segregation at Hadassah and other hospitals. That was when MK Bezalel Smotrich raised a storm when he commented, “My wife is really no racist, but after giving birth she wants rest and not the mass feasts that are common among Arab mothers who give birth.” He added fuel to the fire later when he tweeted, “It’s only natural my wife would not want to lie next to someone who just gave birth to a baby that might murder her baby in another 20 years.”</p> \n<p>That this segregation continues as a matter policy was made clear in the research done for the class action, in which women phoned various hospitals and asked about the separation of Arabs and Jews in calls that were recorded. Women also asked these questions during tours of the hospitals. All the hospitals responded that the separation was arranged without anyone needing to ask.</p> \n<p>Testimony to this policy at Soroka came not just from Arab women who gave birth there and researchers who inquired, but from Naomi, a Jewish teacher from an area kibbutz who had her three children there. When she gave birth there last month, she was put in a room with another Jewish woman. When that mother was discharged the following morning, she was replaced by an Arab woman.</p> \n<p>“Shortly afterward a nurse came over and apologized,” Naomi wrote in her affidavit. “I didn’t understand what the apology was for. The nurse, who was careful to whisper, answered that it was because they’d put ‘her,’ the Arab woman, in the room. She said the department staff did not usually do that and that I had the right to ask to move to another room. The nurse added that the department staff always tried not to put Arab and Jewish women in the same room, but this time there was no choice because this was last available bed in the ward.</p> \n<p>“I was shocked and embarrassed. The whole conversation took place with my roommate lying next to me with only a curtain separating us. I knew she spoke Hebrew and I explained to the nurse that there was no reason for the Arab woman to disturb me. We are all brothers and we are all equal.”</p> \n<p>When Hana (a pseudonym) had her fourth child at Haemek Hospital in the summer of 2016, she was put in an Arab-only room, as had been the case after the three previous births. This time she asked if she could be moved to a larger room. “My request was accepted, apparently because I’d had a difficult birth,” she wrote in her affidavit. “I got to the room with my husband during the night. The Jewish mother who was in the room heard us speaking Arabic and ran out of the room, demanding in a loud voice not to be in a room with an Arab mother. Unfortunately, this request was accepted. Within a short time, The Jewish woman was moved to a different room. After that only Arab mothers were put in my room. I felt humiliated and offended even more than the other times. I felt like they were treating me like a person from an inferior race.”</p> \n<p>Of the four hospitals being sued, only Western Galilee Hospital, in Nahariya, is government-owned. Dunya (a pseudonym) gave birth there hospital in 2011 and in 2014, and both times had to remain in the hospital for more than a week after the delivery. “Both times, throughout my hospitalization, not one Jewish mother was put in the room with me. Women came and went, but all of them were Arabs,” she said.</p> \n<p>Nothing has changed since then. Women who called the hospital and recorded the conversations were told the segregation policy was still in effect. “How do you divide the rooms?” asked one woman inquiring about giving birth in the hospital. “Well if you’re asking, there is separation,” said the hospital representative. “If you mean Jewish-Arab, then we don’t put [them] together.”</p> \n<p>Then-Health Ministry Director General Roni Gamzu refused to issue written instructions barring such segregation. “I do not intend to issue a circular on this issue. It will be disgraceful and probably do more harm than good,” he wrote to Physicians for Human Rights in 2013. A State comptroller’s report issued last year criticized the Health Ministry for not investigating the issue. In its response to the comptroller, the ministry said that since there hadn’t been any official complaints, “As far as we’re concerned it’s not a phenomenon.”</p> \n<p>In 2016, Health Ministry Director General Moshe Bar Siman Tov summoned hospital directors to a meeting on this issue. The hospital directors denied there was an official policy on segregating by religion or nationality. They claimed that if it was happening, it was done at the mothers’ requests out of a desire to please them. They explained that the hospitals compete fiercely for births because they get 13,000 shekels (around $3,600) from the National Insurance institute for each birth and thus seek to satisfy the mothers.</p> \n<p>For this report the Health Ministry responded, “The suit has not yet been received, and when it is received it will be studied and we will respond in court, as is customary.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>GAZIANTEP, Turkey – For most of the Muslim world, Ramadan is a month of fasting, prayer and piety. For Syrian refugees in Turkey, it is one of the few opportunities they have left to visit their home country without fear of being unable to return to the place where they have found sanctuary.</p> \n<p>That’s because, since 2015, Turkey has progressively put an end to its open door policy that allowed Syrians to come and go as they wished: Now, except during the last days of Ramadan, refugees who spend a few days back home are not allowed to return.</p> \n<p>“We wait for the holiday with great excitement throughout the year,” says Mohammed Noor, a Syrian refugee who spent many years in this Turkish border city before moving to Germany in March.</p> \n<p>“People yearn for a visit back home all year round. But at the same time, they want to make sure they preserve their livelihoods in Turkey,” he says.</p> \n<p>The revised border policy reflects a broader harshening of attitudes in Turkey toward Syrian refugees, which is also playing an important role in the political campaign ahead of elections in the country on June 24.</p> \n<p>“The vibe has changed: authorities now want as many Syrians as possible to return for good,” Noor says.</p> \n<p>Turkey has made impressive efforts to alleviate the suffering for millions of Syrians who have left their homes since the beginning of the civil war in 2011. The country has let in nearly 3.6 million Syrians, built refugee camps that are internationally recognized as being the best in the world (though they only host some 220,000 refugees) and the Turkish government has worked hard to integrate the refugees into local society.</p> \n<p>Erdogan’s wall</p> \n<p>The government’s actions were not just out of goodwill but necessity. In the war’s early years, the porous 900-kilometer (560-mile) border with Syria meant Ankara could do little to stop the flow of refugees even if it wanted to. But in early 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan struck a deal with the European Union to receive 6 billion euros ($7.1 billion) in financial support, in exchange for Turkey tightening its borders and keeping refugees in the country.</p> \n<p>Today, though, the chances of Syrians migrating to Turkey look bleak, with the proportion of displaced persons in the war-torn country nearing 70 percent (12.3 million people, according to UN data). Turkey has built a 781-kilometer-long wall sealing off most of the border, and even family reunification cases are routinely denied entry. In the first months of 2018, more than 85,000 refugees were apprehended by Turkish forces and returned to Syria as they tried to cross the border, according to data from Turkish authorities. Some 400,000 were caught last year.</p> \n<p>With the conflict showing no signs of abating, public opinion is growing increasingly intolerant of the Syrian refugees who have found themselves in Turkey.</p> \n<p>At the end of January, a report by the International Crisis Group – an NGO that conducts research on violent conflicts – warned of “rising host community hostility toward the newcomers” and a “threefold increase in intercommunal violence.” It added that “many think Syrians receive preferential access to public services and assistance.”</p> \n<p>Racism against Syrians is on the rise, according to the Hrant Dink Foundation, which has a unit dedicated to monitoring hate speech in the Turkish media. “Our monitoring work showed that since the beginning of 2014, Syrian refugees have been increasingly targeted in Turkey. And in 2017, Syrians were the second most targeted group by hate speech in print media [after Jews],” says the Armenian foundation’s project coordinator, Gamze Tosun. “Also, we know from our research that during elections, the nationalist discourse targeting and discriminating [against] certain groups increases, and these are reproduced and legitimized by media in Turkey,” Tosun adds.</p> \n<p>Anti-Syrian propaganda</p> \n<p>After Erdogan’s surprise decision to call a snap election (ahead of the scheduled date of November 2019), some Syrians in Gaziantep fear politicians may use anti-Syrian rhetoric to win votes.</p> \n<p>Catching up over a glass of chai in a local shisha caf&eacute; popular with Syrian youngsters are Youssouf, Firaz and Mohammed. (They asked that their surnames not be published to protect their safety.) All three are concerned that the opposition will exploit the Syrian question in an effort to gain votes at Erdogan’s expense. Syrian refugees are overwhelmingly supportive of Erdogan, and his conservative, Sunni, Justice and Development Party (AKP) is their natural political home. Some even see the Turkish president as their savior.</p> \n<p>The main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party (CHP), “is already producing anti-Syrian propaganda on social media, saying that we have sent rents skyrocketing, that we steal jobs and are a security threat,” says Firaz, an engineer who hails from Aleppo (like most Syrians in Gaziantep).</p> \n<p>CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, quoted in the country’s largest newspaper, Hurriyet, said there are “some places, like hospitals in Turkey, where Turks are treated as second-class citizens because priority is given to Syrian refugees.” He added that “a Syrian is able to open a shop and be treated as a first-class citizen, but our citizens open a shop and pay taxes.”</p> \n<p>“Everyone is realizing that we are here to stay,” says Youssouf, 29, also from Aleppo. “When I first came to Turkey a few years ago, I didn’t take Turkish classes. But now I’m studying really hard,” he adds.</p> \n<p>In a bid to defuse social tensions, the government is also pushing Syrian children to study in Turkish rather than Arabic. Many Syrian children who grew up in Turkey know of their hometowns only from the nostalgic stories they hear from their parents and grandparents. Youssouf, who is old enough to remember, has pictures of the hospital where he used to work as a nurse. It is mostly destroyed, and his onetime office is now covered in bloodstains. “If politicians misuse the Syrian rhetoric, there will be fights on the street in Turkey,” he warns.</p> \n<p>Hostility crossing party lines</p> \n<p>Research financed by the German Marshall Fund and carried out by researchers at Istanbul Bilgi University suggests the risk of incitement against Syrians during the upcoming campaign is a real possibility. The report, titled “Dimensions of Polarization in Turkey” and published in February, shows that voters of parties across the spectrum have overwhelmingly negative views on Syrian refugees. All party divides disappear when supporters are asked about whether Syrians should return to their own country, the report concludes.</p> \n<p>According to a poll reported by Reuters, Erdogan’s party and its allies are tipped to win 54 percent of the votes in the parliamentary election, defeating the opposition in the first round. Other polls are less favorable, but still see Erdogan at an advantage against the coalition of opposition parties.</p> \n<p>Erdogan and his party are aware of voters’ concerns and have themselves recently called for the return of Syrian refugees to Syria. With the negative attitude toward Syrian refugees becoming a rare consensus point among Turks – and with people increasingly seeing the issue as a personal problem rather than a social catastrophe – for once public opinion has affected government rhetoric, rather than the other way around.</p> \n<p>“We want our refugee brothers and sisters to return to their land, to their homes. We are not in the position to hide 3.5 million here forever,” Hurriyet quoted Erdogan as saying in February. His wife, Emine Erdogan, said the same month that Turkey hopes that at least 500,000 refugees will return to the northwestern Syrian district of Afrin following the Turkish military’s anti-Kurdish operation earlier this year. Many officials have made similar remarks in recent months.</p> \n<p>According to the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Authority, some 150,000 Syrians have returned home from Turkey in the last 18 months. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is busy interviewing returnees to make sure they go back voluntarily, as forcing them to leave violates international law.</p> \n<p>Crucially, data seen by Haaretz shows that, in the first half of 2018, the number of people saying they returned because of “living conditions” in Turkey has doubled compared to the last period of 2017 – though the majority still quote family reunification as the main reason for going back to Syria.</p> \n<p>Gaziantep Province is one of the areas in Turkey most affected by the influx of Syrian refugees, with over 500,000 Syrians having settled in the city of Gaziantep alone – almost as many as in the entire metropolis of Istanbul.</p> \n<p>The head of the municipality’s health and social services office, Abdullah Aksoy, says he hopes 80 percent of Syrian refugees will return home in the long-term.</p> \n<p>“After Operation Euphrates Shield, which liberated large swaths of Northern Syria from the Islamic State, Turkey took it upon itself to guarantee security and spearhead reconstruction in the liberated areas, enabling 70, 000 to return to Jarabulus,” he says.</p> \n<p>As far as the elections go, Aksoy fears the main opposition parties may turn the Syrians into a political football, “as they have previously done in local and regional elections.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, the left-wing, pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) has long claimed that Erdogan wants to settle Syrian refugees in southeastern Turkey to upset the demographic balance in areas where Kurds are the majority. Erdogan announced last July he would grant Turkish citizenship to Syrian refugees. And while this policy remains ad hoc, targeting individual Syrians, rumors in Gaziantep suggest an increasing number are getting it.</p> \n<p>Building camps in Syria</p> \n<p>The head of the German Marshall Fund in Turkey, Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, strikes a more optimistic note. He says that while Turkish voters are mostly hostile to Syrians, “they do not consider the migrants as a high priority ahead of the elections.</p> \n<p>“I only fear Syrians could be turned into scapegoats if the economic downturn worsens and the people associate that with the migrants,” he tells Haaretz. He sees the calls for “return” as “mere rhetoric to rally support for the military operations in Syria,” while “the government is not able to promote repatriations actively – though in the future it could give incentives to send people back to areas in Syria controlled by Turkey.”</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, UN and NGO workers in Ankara and across Turkey say they are concerned by reports that the authorities are increasingly deporting Syrians back to their homeland illegally. In the bordertown of Kilis, where the number of Syrians has long since overtaken the number of Turkish citizens, three Syrians were caught walking the street by police without residency permits on them. According to a UN employee in Ankara, who asked not to be named, “The police didn’t even give the father of the woman and her two kids the time to come from home to the police station with the documents: they just kicked them out to Syria – which of course is illegal under international law, since it is a war zone.”</p> \n<p>A number of Syrians have also been deported to Sudan – a country that until recently did not require visas, says Yakzan Shishakly from the Maram Foundation for Relief and Development, which helps Syrian refugees.</p> \n<p>“The problem is that even the people deported ‘back home’ by Turkey do not end up where they came from, but only to the areas under Turkish control. It’s a crime,” says Rami Jarrah, a prominent Syrian political activist who grew up in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>“The Turks are already building refugee camps in Afrin,” says another UN employee in Gaziantep, who also asked not to be named. “It is obvious they aim to remove parts of the Syrian population from Turkey and resettle them there.” He believes that “the military operations in Syria were partly intended to do this and to resettle formerly Kurdish areas in Syria.</p> \n<p>“The honeymoon between Syrians and Turks is over,” he concludes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>More than two months after an undecided election left Italy with a hung parliament, the scenario that terrified many moderates and EU supporters has materialized. For the first time in post-war history, a major western European democracy will be led by a majority of Eurosceptic populists and far-right politicians. Following weeks of negotiations, Rome is now poised to fall to the coalition formed by the far-right anti-immigrant League party and the grassroots anti-establishment 5 Star Movement.</p> \n<p>The two parties have signed a broad coalition agreement and are now finalizing the government team, after their respective leaders – the firebrand Matteo Salvini for the League and the fresh-faced Luigi di Maio for the 5 Stars – agreed to set aside their personal ambitions and leave the premiership to a more moderate and technocratic figure. The job is widely expected to go to Giuseppe Conte, a little-known law professor with no political experience.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Vladimir Putin just won Italy's election</p> \n<p>The 5 Stars and the League emerged as the top parties in the March 4 elections, capturing 32 and 17 percent of the vote respectively, meaning it would have been impossible to form a majority in parliament without at least one of these forces. Early scrutiny of the unprecedented yellow-green alliance, named after the colors of the 5 Stars and League respectively, has focused on the “contract” the two forces signed to outline how they intend to govern.</p> \n<p>The agreement is a mix of ultra-liberalist policies and socially-minded populist moves, from introducing a flat tax rate to lowering the retirement age and granting citizen stipends. The deal does not reference plans to take Italy out of the Euro zone or write off public debt held by the European Central Bank – policies the parties had supported during the election campaign. Still, the mere promise of crowd-pleasing but costly reforms, which Italy’s debt-laden balance sheet can hardly afford, has been enough to rattle Italian markets and prompt warnings from European allies calling on the new government to respect EU budget rules and not endanger the stability of the Euro zone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Beyond the coalition’s economic platform, little attention has been paid to its foreign policy plan and what it could mean for Rome’s positioning both in the EU and in the various crisis zones of the Middle East.</p> \n<p>While section nine of the coalition agreement is titled “Foreign Policy,” it deals overwhelmingly with prospective policy toward a single country: Russia.</p> \n<p>The contract pledges to keep Italy in NATO and preserve the alliance with the United States, while “reaching out to Russia, which should not be perceived as a threat but as an economic and commercial partner.” The joint platform goes on to call for an “immediate” end to all western sanctions on Russia and for the “rehabilitation” of Moscow as a “strategic counterpart” to solve a host of regional conflicts in Syria, Libya and Yemen. The text concludes that “since Russia is not a military threat,” NATO and the EU should focus on other issues in the Mediterranean, such as Islamic extremism and the “uncontrolled” flow of migrants.</p> \n<p>This single-minded dedication to improving ties with Moscow as a panacea for all that ails the world is in line with the close links both parties are known to have cultivated with the Kremlin.</p> \n<p>The 5 Star Movement, which, over the last decade, has pioneered the use of social media in Italy to channel voter outrage at the country’s corrupt political establishment, routinely hosts propaganda material and fake news sourced from Kremlin-linked outlets such as Sputnik and Russia Today on its vast online network.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ahead of the elections, Italian officials sounded the alarm over how Russian interference and social media influencing campaigns could favor the populist parties.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both the 5 Stars and the League have praised Russian President Vladimir Putin’s policies, defended Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, panned the EU sanctions that followed it and forged official ties with the ruling United Russia party.</p> \n<p>The League’s leader Salvini once summed up his international political links by tweeting: “Viva Trump, viva Putin, viva Le Pen,” referring to Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Front, a key ally for the League in the European Parliament.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While the new government’s proximity to Moscow is easy to predict, it is harder at this point to foresee how this historical shift in Italian politics will play out in Rome’s relations with Israel.</p> \n<p>Salvini has displayed similar affection for Israel as other far-right populists in Europe, who see the Jewish state as a bulwark against Islamic extremists and terrorism. He has declared himself a “friend and brother of Israel” and visited the country in 2016, meeting Knesset members and condemning Hamas for “holding hostage” millions of Israelis and Palestinians.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Salvini has not shied away from conspiracy theories with an age-old anti-Semitic flavor, such as accusing Jewish-American magnate George Soros of supporting illegal immigration into Italy.</p> \n<p>The 5 Star Movement’s record on Israel and Jews is even spottier. The movement has long flirted with many of the conspiracy theories peddled by its founder, comedian Beppe Grillo, such as the idea that a secret cabal of bankers and financiers runs the world or that the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States were an inside job.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Grillo has written on his popular blog that Israel is “frightening” and “irresponsible” and could start a Third World War, and his followers in parliament have displayed a strong anti-Israeli bent, accusing the Jewish state of genocide during the 2014 Gaza War and calling on the government to cut diplomatic ties.</p> \n<p>But which of these ideological streams will control and direct Rome’s Middle East policy?</p> \n<p>Italian media report that the foreign minister post is expected to go to Gampiero Massolo, a respected diplomat and former head of the body that coordinates Italy’s secret services.</p> \n<p>The fact that technocrats are slated to be tapped as prime minister and foreign minister suggests that, to placate EU allies, the coalition is happy to have moderates be the government’s face abroad, while Salvini takes the Interior Ministry to focus on his anti-immigrant agenda (he has promised to “cleanse” the country “street by street, piazza by piazza”) and the 5 Star leader Di Maio shepherds through economic reforms.</p> \n<p>But will these technocrats wield any power, or will they just be puppets in the hands of their populist masters? If so, it remains to be seen whether policy toward Israel will be determined by the League or the 5 Stars, or whether it will also be influenced by the ups and downs of the complex and delicate relationship between Jerusalem and Rome’s new great friend, Russia.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israel Water Authority is asking the public to shorten shower time by two minutes as part of a new campaign to save water.</p> \n<p>The campaign was unveiled on Tuesday to address the shortage caused by five years of drought in Israel. The authority hopes that the effort will save some 50 million cubic meters of water a year – about half the annual output of a large water desalination plant.</p> \n<p>Other water-saving measures outlined in the authority's plan call for more efficient use of water for gardening and landscaping purposes by local governments.</p> \n<p>Household water consumption has risen significantly in recent years, according to a strategic plan for dealing with the shortage that has been prepared by the National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Ministry, and is due to be presented for cabinet approval soon.</p> \n<p>Specifically, the ministry and the Water Authority say such consumption has risen by over 40 million cubic meters during the past two years – a 10-percent increase in total household water usage. This surge has been attributed to the fact that previous campaigns to encourage Israelis to save water have lapsed and lost their effect.</p> \n<p>Moreover, after five years of below-average rainfall, the level of water in Lake Kinneret, the Sea of Galilee,&nbsp;is a 38 centimeters below the bottom red line (213 meters below sea level). The amount of water flowing in the Dan springs in the north, the largest natural springs in the Middle East, are at an all-time low.</p> \n<p>The water-saving schemes, prompted by the dire situation of the last few years, are also meant to address future droughts, through 2030. They suggest means to increase the production of drinking water using seawater-desalination facilities, along with a strategy to revive the once-successful public relations water-saving campaigns.</p> \n<p>One such effort included not only advertisements and commercials but also provision of water-saving devices for the home, such as flow regulators for taps and showers, and devices that reduce the amount of water used when flushing toilets. That campaign led to a 10-percent reduction in household water use.</p> \n<p>The Infrastructure Ministry says the recent rise in water consumption cannot be explained solely by Israel's rapid population increase. It also stems from the public being less careful about using water, based in part on the misconception that today’s large-scale desalination efforts render such efforts unnecessary. In addition, the relevant authorities believe that the effect of steep increases in the price of water in 2010, which led to a large drop in household consumption, has worn off. Combined with the relatively modest reduction in that price last year, there is no real incentive for people to be more efficient when it comes to consuming water.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Do you wage an all-out war against invaders — or do you treat them with compassion?</p> \n<p>The question is a burning one — at least among environmentalists, scientists and government agencies in Israel trying to develop a strategy for handling invasive species. Until recently the approach was clear: War. The means employed include shooting to kill invasive animals and using herbicides to destroy invasive plants.</p> \n<p>In a similar spirit, the Society for Protection of Nature in Israel filed a petition last month demanding that the state present a plan to fight invasive species (after the Environmental Protection Ministry pledged to do so). While the Supreme Court rejected the petition Justice Noam Sohlberg called invasive species “a threat to nature, water sources and humans,” and said that “no one disputes that invasive species that have made inroads in nature do indeed cause damage to habitats and natural assets, including protected natural assets.”</p> \n<p>According to scientists and nature protection groups, these species push out local species, spread disease and broadly change ecosystems. In their petition to the Supreme Court, the SPNI wrote that in 54 percent of endangered species of flora and fauna worldwide, invasive species are the main threat.</p> \n<p>But there are scientists who say that these creatures actually enrich the ecosystem to which they migrated. These critical voices have been calling for a re-evaluation of the role of these animal and plant migrants and even urge compassion toward these invaders. They are behind a new school of research called “compassionate nature conservation,” which now has its Israeli defenders as well. They are centered at Tel Aviv University, where a research group in this field has been established, led by Dr. Dror Ben-Ami.</p> \n<p>A recent issue of the Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution, edited by Ben-Ami and devoted to compassionate nature conservation, included an article by Dr. Arian Wallach of the University of Technology Sydney, dealing with migrant plants and animals in Israel. These are the species that came here not necessarily “on purpose.” Some were animals raised as pets and released to the wild by their owners and multiplied. Nutrias, which were brought to Israel to be raised for their fur, escaped their fate and reproduced in nature.</p> \n<p>Other species, mainly plants, came with cargo aboard ship. Some were brought intentionally, like the acacia, planted to stabilize sand dunes but over-proliferated.</p> \n<p>All of these species are discussed in the article by Wallach, an Israeli scientist who has been in Australia for some years and monitors policy on invasive species there. Wallach has found 122 migrating species in Israel, two thirds of which are plants and invertebrates.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the migrants have increased Israel’s biodiversity by 104 species (after subtracting now extinct species). To date, there has been no evidence of any migrating species causing the extinction of local species, Wallach states in her article.</p> \n<p>Wallach writes that one concern of the field of “invasive biology” was that migrant species endanger local species because they had not evolved together. But observations show that native species adapt to the newcomers. For example an invasive plant in Australia initially went wild because no local species fed on it, but gradually, local bacteria developed the ability to reach the roots of the plant and consume it.</p> \n<p>The illusion of back to the past</p> \n<p>Wallach agrees that in some cases local populations are negatively impacted by migrant species, but says that killing off the migrants is not the only answer, and in many cases is impractical. One way to deal with the problem is to make sure there are natural spaces where a wide variety of species can exist. According to Wallach the desire to get rid of migrant species is the illusion that nature can be returned to some stage in the past.</p> \n<p>However, “In contrast to invasion biology that was adopted relatively late, compassionate conservation established in Israel almost immediately.” This, Wallach says in the article, “provides an opportunity for reflection before entrenching policies that are harmful, divisive and difficult to reverse.”</p> \n<p>The concept Wallach represents is centered on ethical considerations. Two of the main principles of compassionate conservation are that all wildlife has value and animals should be treated as individuals that can experience pain. Another principle is “do no harm” which is also a basic precept of medicine. For example, sometimes it’s best to do nothing rather than interfere in the functioning of an ecosystem.</p> \n<p>These principles hold, according to Wallach, even in cases of species considered problematic by nature protection authorities, such as biting fire ants, which came to Israel from South America, or white sallow, a species of acacia from Australia that has taken over wide swaths of dunes and changed the ecosystem.</p> \n<p>“Humans have acted violently toward different organisms throughout history, from ants to elephants,” Wallach told Haaretz. Wallach says that species like the white sallow “contradict opinions about the way nature should look. These opinions are based on an arbitrary and half-religious definition of nature as maintaining certain conditions in a narrow time frame. But from the perspective of compassionate nature conservation, ecosystems with or without the white sallow have an intrinsic value.”</p> \n<p>Such arguments will not persuade those who see nature in Israel changing due to migrant species, for example, the myna, which came from East Asia and often pushes out other birds, or ambrosia, from the United States, which has taken over natural and cultivated areas.</p> \n<p>“We don’t need to reach the point of complete extinction to know that action must be taken against invasive species,” counters Dr. Yehoshua Shkedy, science chief at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. “These species do push out local speciesthere’s enough experience in the world to see this. It’s happened with us where there are acacias, and eucalyptus as well,” he says, warning that if action is not taken “we’ll lose biodiversity throughout the world.”</p>",

We always remember that.</p> \n<p>&quot;And because of this, you have not only the support of our government but the profound gratitude of the people of Israel. We remember our friends. We have no better friends than you,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>At the event, Netanyahu also said &quot;Paraguay helped Jews escape Nazi Germany. We will never forget this.&quot; Paraguay, however, was also known as a safe haven for Nazi fugitives - including Josef Mengele.</p> \n<p>Cartes responded by saying, &quot;From the depth of my heart, I appreciate this country that courageously defends its right to live in peace and it is building a praiseworthy economically prosperous state that ensures its future and that of its children.&quot;</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin met with Cartes before the ceremony and said he was &quot;happy and proud&quot; to host him. &quot;Paraguay is thousands of miles from here, but our hearts are close.&quot;</p> \n<p>Cartes thanked him and said, &quot;Many ask me why we decided to move the embassy to Jerusalem and I can say that we decided to put things in their right place. We don't owe you anything and you don't owe us anything. This is just the right thing to do.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;After Paraguay, Abbas urges Latin American leaders: Don't move embassies to Jerusalem</p> \n<p>In Paraguayan circles, Cartes is considered controversial: a billionaire from banking and trading in cigars and drink, his name has been associated with money-laundering and drug-smuggling.</p> \n<p>He also served as president of a soccer club and was elected leader of the right-wing Colorado party that had formerly served as the political power base of the tyrant Alfredo Stroessner, a military general who led Paraguay as president from 1954 to 1989. Cartes is also a self-avowed homophobe, known for comparing the LGBT community to “monkeys.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu met with Cartes in September 2017, in Buenos Aires, saying “You are a great friend and I think that there is a lot of potential in the cooperation that we have for the betterment of both our peoples and to help, to the extent that Israel can offer its experience in technology, agriculture, water, and security.”</p> \n<p>Cartes answered that they work well together, though in his opinion, much remains to be done. “Relations are like a muscle, you have to exercise every day,” Cartes said, adding, “But I want you to know that we like you very much.”</p> \n<p>In March 2017 Walla reported on the relationship between Cartes and Netanyahu’s former bureau chief, Ari Harow, who has since turned state’s witness. The strategy consultancy H3 Global, whose name arose in the context of the Harow case, claims on its website to have advised Cartes before and after his election in 2013. It also writes that Israel reopening its embassy in Paraguay’s was against the expert opinion of the Foreign Ministry. Harow’s lawyer said at the time that upon Harow’s appointment as chief of staff, he recused himself from handling issues related to Paraguay.</p> \n<p>Local media in Paraguay reported that the decision to move the relocate the embassy to Jerusalem has drawn criticism in the country, and the decision will be reevaluated under the administration of the incoming president, Mario Abdo Benitez.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At the heart of the High Court of Justice’s denial of a petition against the Israeli army’s rules of engagement covering the use of live fire on the Gaza border, during recent demonstrations by Gazan protesters, is an assumption by Justice Hanan Melcer.</p> \n<p>He believes that the large number of dead and wounded Gazans up to now – and the fact that, according to the petitioners, “many were wounded in the upper parts of their bodies, some of them in the back” – will lead to lessons being learned and the examination of alternate methods being used, nonlethal wherever possible, as well as a thorough investigation of what happened in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>However, it is hard to believe this assumption has a basis in fact. It’s not enough to deny a petition while spouting such words in order to bring about the use of less lethal methods. As for conducting a more thorough investigation, experience shows that even investigations of serious cases of Palestinian civilian deaths at the hands of the Israel Defense Forces went nowhere.</p> \n<p>The court’s words express conflicting messages: On the one hand, the petition is rejected based on the assumption that the IDF conducts itself according to Israeli law and the rules of international humanitarian law, while respecting the laws of war. On the other hand, the assumption that the high number of casualties will result in lessons being drawn regarding the use of alternative methods leads to a serious concern that the IDF is not fulfilling its obligations.</p> \n<p>This duality finds further expression: The main legal issue presented to the High Court was whether the IDF’s rules of engagement are consistent with international law. During armed conflict, international law allows to target only combatants. It is also possible to target civilians who directly participate in hostilities, but only while they actually participate in the hostilities. In other situations, which fall under the law enforcement paradigm (rather than the armed conflict paradigm), international law allows the shooting of someone only if he poses a clear and imminent threat to the life (or body) of others.</p> \n<p>The IDF has recently claimed that it is permissible to shoot at “key inciters.” This is a dangerous policy that creates a new category of persons whose blood it is acceptable to shed. These are neither combatants nor civilians who are directly participating in hostilities, nor civilians posing an imminent danger to anyone’s life.</p> \n<p>The High Court ruling illustrates that the IDF policy is indeed that it is permissible to shoot “key inciters” and even “key demonstrators” – although the directives here are to shoot at the legs, and only as a last resort. The court’s president, Esther Hayut, noted in her ruling (which was joined by Justice Neal Hendel) that the category of “key inciter” or “key demonstrator” is not anchored in international law. She added that the place to resolve the question of who belongs in these categories is in “operational and other investigations.”</p> \n<p>One can accept the court’s ruling that it is hard for it to intervene in such cases, when it is asked to discuss the implementation of the rules of engagement in the absence of more concrete information. It is more difficult to accept the gap between Melcer’s concern regarding the high number of casualties hit in their upper bodies and backs, as well as the discomfort of Hayut regarding the creation of a new category of key “inciters and demonstrators” that are legitimate targets, with the bottom line: The lack of intervention by the court, while leaving the investigation of the factual questions – and in practice also of the legal ones – to be done retrospectively. Such an investigation will be conducted too late for those wounded and killed by IDF fire, and will be buried along with the victims.</p> \n<p>Aeyal Gross is a board member of the Association of Civil Rights in Israel, which was one of the petitioners in the case.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The melodies he composed have captivated worshippers for years. Perhaps because of the joy that characterizes most of them, the thirst in synagogues for new and original tunes, or because of the distinctive path of the “singing rabbi,” who did not always follow the commandments to the letter and preferred feelings instead.</p> \n<p>The start of the controversy surrounding him recalled the struggle between Hasidim and Mitnagdim, which almost led to a split in Judaism 200 years ago, because the former group believed that the worship of God is expressed through clinging to righteousness and upholding the precepts through joy, whereas the approach of the latter held that faith is manifested through rigorous Torah study.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach was actually born into the world of the scholarly Lithuanian yeshivas, and despite his success in that world, he left it as an adult. But his activity was also frowned on in the Chabad sect, which he joined at first – to the point where Carlebach (1925-1994) almost founded a Hasidic sect of his own. His way, which focused on lessons that carried an emotional moral message, accompanied by music and with the acceptance of every person as such, easily gathered momentum in the Woodstock years. At the same time, though, there was increasingly acute criticism of what was liable to lead people to abandon Orthodox Judaism.</p> \n<p>However, this wasn’t the reason that Jonathan Howard, 28, a Jerusalemite who does research in the field of Jewish studies at Tel Aviv University, decided to boycott Carlebach's liturgical melodies. It became a situation in which, for him, prayer is blasphemy and leaving the synagogue is the precept, even the sanctification of God’s name.</p> \n<p>Howard had heard of rumors about Carlebach’s improper behavior toward women for years, but when he learned about the rabbi’s assaults on underage girls, he felt that a red line had been crossed. “His public profile,” Howard explains in an interview with Haaretz, “served as an engine to harm people. I don’t feel right about using his music. Even if he used it for sacred ends, it is not something with which it’s possible to sanctify the name of God. Even if the atmosphere in the 1960s was different, doing harm to minors is absolutely beyond the pale, it’s sanctification of the Holy Name by the filthiest means.”</p> \n<p>The result is that on Friday evening, for example, Howard will either leave the synagogue and return after Kabbalat Shabbat – the ceremony ushering in the Sabbath – or, if he is serving as the cantor, he will choose the melodies himself. The problem is that there is hardly any liberal Orthodox Ashkenazi minyan (prayer quorum of at least 10 adults) that doesn’t use Carlebach’s melodies. Of late, the first possibility is causing Howard such mental anguish that he prefers to join minyans that he or his friends organize, or he arrives late for the service. He says he and his wife Lior Shapira usually worship with the egalitarian Orthodox Shabbat Baboker minyan.</p> \n<p>Musicality is not the only reason that synagogues opt for Carlebach’s melodies. “He has almost holy status, both in terms of his public activity and also regarding the number of people he attracted to religion,” says Howard. “People react by saying, ‘It’s inconceivable, no way, he’s a total saint,’ like they do when they year about other rabbis who are caught doing similar acts. There is also the idea that ‘niggun is not susceptible to ritual impurity’ – in other words, we can accept someone’s artistry even if we object to things he did.”</p> \n<p>In this sense, Howard compares the attitude many still maintain toward Carlebach to that of rock fans who ignore a performer’s sexual violence, and wonders how much of a difference there actually is between lovers of different types of music. Still, admiring singers in performance or through listening to their music is not the same as introducing their melodies into prayers.</p> \n<p>Howard believes that it’s legitimate to distinguish between the creative artist and his creation, although he himself does not make that distinction. For him, walking out of the prayer service is a passive protest, and he doesn’t intend that it be a provocative act: When he leaves, he keeps a low profile. After Kabbalat Shabbat, which generally includes Psalms that have been set to music and often Carlebach melodies, he returns to his place, and even if not everyone is pleased with what he has done no one protests vehemently.</p> \n<p>When Howard and Lior, 26, were married not long ago, they embarked on that they call a “musicological investigation,” to come up with melodies that had not been composed by Carlebach. That’s easier said than done, since nearly everything that’s related to “sasson vesimha” – joy and happiness – has some sort of connection to the late rabbi’s music.</p> \n<p>Shapira says she feels a “kvetch in the stomach” when her husband leaves the service, and she doesn’t leave with him. She makes do with trying to persuade others not to sing Carlebach songs. As she sees it, this does not mean she is more forgiving – possibly even the opposite.</p> \n<p>“The music is wonderful, but why are minors the red line? Where does the line run? As a woman, I am unfortunately completely used [to such behavior], and I have zero expectations of men who hold key positions in the religious establishment, when it comes to their attitude toward women. If I were to boycott every man in a key post whose opinions about women I don’t like, or whose remarks about women I don’t like – I would not be religiously observant,” Shapira explains.</p> \n<p>Though her views may seem extreme, there are some people who don’t stop with rabbis or others from the present generation. “In every generation, many of the great creative artists would not pass the contemporary test of sexual harassment,” says Dvir Haddad, 22, from Ramat Gan, who is working on his master’s in Hebrew Bible studies at Bar-Ilan University. “I am convinced that not a few of the Jewish sages of antiquity and not a few of the great poskim” – legal scholars who decide on issues of halakha (traditional Jewish law) – “were very problematic individuals in regard to their attitude toward the women around them or toward younger people, and I don’t know whether because of that we should stop studying or singing their works.”</p> \n<p>Haddad experiences this tension in his lessons at Bar-Ilan, and notes that if he were to forgo Carlebach he’d have to forgo also the Bible and the Talmud. But if he doesn’t forgo him, “then it’s akin to ‘the occupation corrupts’ and to allowing evil to reside within me, because that work was created by a soul that in my eyes is accursed.”</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Haddad has found a compromise: For the past year he’s been praying in a Sephardi synagogue where Carlebach is not sung. In other minyans, he either leaves or doesn’t sing the relevant portions of the liturgy, and also refuses to study matters relating to wedlock and relationships between couples as expounded by Carlebach.</p> \n<p>Haddad: “I once attended a lesson by Rabbi [Yaakov] Medan about the Book of Genesis, and he said that we must not look to that book to learn how to be a good family, because that’s not present there. The same can be said of Carlebach. All the romanticism that he tries to create, and the connection between the male and female who are beloved of one another, is not something I would care to learn from a person who comported himself as he did. If we learn from him about charity, I am ambivalent but try to extract the good with a heavy heart.”</p> \n<p>Haddad’s awareness of Carlebach developed early on. As a group leader in the national-religious Bnei Akiva youth movement, he led an activity about Carlebach in the hope that those in the group would also express opposition.</p> \n<p>Dylan and darkness</p> \n<p>Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach started out as a student at a famous Lithuanian – that is, non-Hasidic – yeshiva in Lakewood, New Jersey (which later became one of the world’s largest yeshivas), and went on to receive his ordination at the ultra-Orthodox Rav Chaim Berlin Yeshiva in Brooklyn, in 1954. Though he distinguished himself in his studies, Carlebach did not find what he was looking for in the Lithuanian world and was drawn into the world of Lubavitch Chabad. There, he was tapped by the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, to serve as an emissary for the movement, spreading the word on college campuses. However, he left Chabad in the wake of disagreements with the Rebbe. The background to the falling-out between the two was saliently feminist: Carlebach wanted to have women attend his lessons and allowed them to sing. The Lubavitcher Rebbe dissociated himself from such acts, ruling that they were contrary to the halakha.</p> \n<p>Carlebach began playing the guitar as an adult, and soon started composing melodies for texts based on biblical verses. He had a style all his own and became known as the “singing rabbi” and sometimes the “dancing rabbi,” for his habit of jumping up and down during his performances; he was also known for hobnobbing with other musicians of the period, including Bob Dylan. Carlebach founded the House of Love and Prayer in San Francisco, a learning center that was open to all and gained him publicity for his openness and avant-garde approach.</p> \n<p>In 1998, some four years after his death, the Jewish women’s magazine Lilith published an article by Sarah Blustain about “Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach’s Shadow Side.” It contained a host of testimonies alleging that the had sexually assaulted women and girls. In some of the cases the same pattern was repeated: Rabbi Carlebach would embrace his victim for a long time, and what began as an innocent hug continued until he achieved sexual release.</p> \n<p>According to the article, his spiritual approach sprang up at a time “when social boundaries were being broken” – among other things in the opposition to the separation of men and women in Orthodox Judaism. Today, almost all feminist movements, including those with a religious character, would not readily accept such a suggestion. Indeed, there is a common perception among religious circles that says that it is precisely women’s presence in the public domain that has led to their being harassed.</p> \n<p>In one case, an attempt to confront the rabbi with accusations about his behavior was reportedly made at a public gathering, but it was unsuccessful. Carlebach apparently heard about the intention behind the event, and the women who attended relented and declined to back the allegations made by one of those present. It is said in general that the rabbi knew there were complaints about his behavior and also realized that people knew what he had done. Moreover, in private, sources say, Carlebach did not completely deny what was imputed to him and even reportedly admitted, “Oy, this needs such a fixing.” And there were even female members of his own family who say they avoided any contact with him.</p> \n<p>There is widespread awareness of Carlebach’s darker side among American Jews, and if anything, the subject has won even greater prominence recently, thanks to the “#metoo” movement.</p> \n<p>For David A.M. Wilensky, the online editor of the San Francisco-based J: The Jewish News of Northern California, the subject is not only close to his heart but also physically proximate: He lives in the city where Carlebach launched his independent activities, and it’s possible that some of the women who were hurt are members of his community.</p> \n<p>“The #metoo movement has heightened awareness of the subject, as you can see from the attitude toward Bill Cosby, even though his actions took place years ago, and it has also impacted on synagogues,” Wilensky explains, in a phone interview. “But whereas it’s very easy to avoid Cosby on television, it’s almost impossible to enter an Orthodox or Reform synagogue in the United States without hearing Carlebach’s melodies. And because he composed so many songs, there’s a good chance you’ll hear his music without knowing that he is the creative artist behind it.”</p> \n<p>The Facebook group Wilensky and rabbinical student Lauren Tuchman established, “Anything but Carlebach,” has one basic rule: talking about Carlebach or anything to do with him is forbidden within the group. The virtual setting, Wilensky explains, is intended to provide a substitute for the songs. The motivation of the participants is opposition to Carlebach’s acts, revulsion at his songs and a desire to preserve pre-Carlebach cantorial music.</p> \n<p>In Israel, however, many of those who worship in the Carlebach style are still unaware of the allegations against him. When Jonathan Howard published a post on the subject on the popular Hebrew-language Facebook page “I Am a Religious Feminist – and I Don’t Have a Sense of Humor, Either,” in which he drew a comparison between the attitude of this public toward popular Israeli singer Eyal Golan, who was accused of sexual improprieties, and the attitude toward Carlebach – he got multiple responses expressing surprise to hear about the rabbi in this context.</p> \n<p>“The attitude of the religious feminist public is one of very clear solidarity with those who were hurt by Golan,” Howard wrote in the post. “In addition to the struggles not to grant Golan the right to perform, there are also responses of discomfort whenever he’s played on the radio even after his actions were made public, and a lack of desire to see his presence in public On the other hand, public discourse has passed over Carlebach as though there were nothing. He’s still the star in feminist minyans and there is still a whole literature, written and oral, of ‘praises of Carlebach,’ and his moral image is held up as a role model in the spirit of Jewish values concerning love of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>There were some who supported Howard and wrote that they look only for synagogues where Carlebach’s melodies are not sung, and others who stressed that the rabbi is no longer alive. It was also noted that there’s a tendency to forgive Carlebach, because he is “one of ours,” being Ashkenazi, while it’s easy to get angry at Golan, a Mizrahi, who is “one of theirs” – evidence of what many believe is an unjust double standard.</p> \n<p>According to Emuna Klein Barnoy, a religiously observant feminist – who maintains that as long as there are women around who were hurt by Carlebach, his teachings and music should be completely boycotted – the reason for the limited awareness of him is no different than any other attempt to deny the victimization of women and girls by people with power. “There are mechanisms of silencing, and if people don’t find it relevant, it doesn’t especially interest them,” she explains. “For people for whom this is not a sensitive point, Carlebach died long ago and he is not assaulting anyone, so there is no need to preserve awareness in order to safeguard women from him.”</p> \n<p>People who walk out of services when his melodies are sung are still considered weird, Barnoy notes: “It’s very difficult for people to fight against something they get enjoyment from. It’s hard for them to believe that a person they love engaged in sexual assault. People are very fond of his prayers, and many, as adolescents, heard opposition to him because he was considered spiritual. It was thought he was spoiling the young generation. Carlebach was depicted by educators as not being serious, and young people fought to adopt a posture of Hasidism in the face of a rigid conception of scholarship. So, people who fought to see Carlebach as a spiritual model are now finding it difficult to oppose him, and it’s self-evident that in every synagogue in which Carlebach is sung, it’s hard to accept that he was not without blemish, and it’s convenient to ignore what he did.”</p> \n<p>‘He was all love’</p> \n<p>Many of Carlebach’s admirers are indeed reluctant to accept the allegations against him. Hezkiya Sofer, 33, from Jerusalem, always attends Carlebach-style services and doesn’t understand the whole issue.</p> \n<p>“My focus is on the good and the desirable,” he says, “and what others think is not my affair. I don’t see myself as a critic; let everyone follow his heart. I love Reb Shlomo deeply. He brought a new spirit to Judaism in the last generation. The singing and the melodies are the better known sides, but also the ones that less deep. Shlomo said that a rabbi once told him, ‘Your melodies are very un-Jewish.’ He replied that he’s right and that with his permission he would play for him an ancient melody composed by the Ba’al Shem Tov [18-century founder of Hasidic Judaism]. Reb Shlomo played the rabbi one of his own tunes, and the rabbi said it was ‘heavenly.’ In other words, deep down, even the opponents don’t know.”</p> \n<p>Adds Sofer: “He entered the deepest place in the soul of every person, his innermost being. His love for everyone, Jew and non-Jew, was unprecedented. He performed around the world. A person who was all love. He couldn’t hurt a fly, and even when he had nothing, he gave to charity.”</p> \n<p>As for those who claim that Rabbi Carlebach hurt more than a fly, Sofer says that if that happened, it should be completely condemned. However, “It’s not fair to describe a situation 20 years after someone dies and he can’t defend himself.” In Sofer’s view, “There were girls he met who were in a terrible psychological condition, and he helped them as much as he could and saved them from the lower depths, and gave them a hug and a kiss. Looking back, when they’re standing on their own two feet thanks to him, they interpret his embrace and kiss negatively.”</p> \n<p>One of the admirers of the dancing rabbi is his daughter, Neshama Carlebach, who launched her own musical career immediately after his death, when she was 20.</p> \n<p>In a heartrending blog entry the singer published last January on the Times of Israel website, titled, “My sisters, I hear you,” she addressed the charges made against her father and wrote that according to tradition, silence is consent and therefore she cannot remain silent. She wrote that she identifies with the women and the girls who were hurt by her father and says she will always stand with them “until that day when the world commits to healing and wholeness for all, for the countless women who have suffered the evils of sexual harassment and assault.”</p> \n<p>Her solidarity with victims of sexual assault is based, in part, on her own experience: When Carlebach was 9 years old, a friend of her father’s, who was also a rabbi, molested her in her bedroom. Since then, she writes, she has “walked through life in fear,” and feels that it’s necessary to support organizations such as #metoo.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, she points out that people are complex beings and that this complexity stood out in her father, “who saw sisters and brothers cut down by the Nazis, who jumped straight from the insular yeshiva world of his childhood into the boundary-less, free-love world of Berkeley in the late ‘60s, who revolutionized Jewish music forever and embraced every human being – was complicated too.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Carlebach was one of the first to support the struggle led by Jerusalem activist Anat Hoffman, who heads the Women of the Wall group, which supports egalitarian access to worship at the Western Wall. He also fought more intensively than perhaps anyone else in the Orthodox rabbinate at the time to allow women to be ordained as rabbis. “That he did not live to see all that would come from these acts of radical love brings me great sadness,” Neshama Carlebach writes, in the same blog post.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Fifty years ago, the American left shattered into countless fragments, and it has yet to recover. Blacks, anti-Vietnam protesters, white union members, Mexican workers, feminists and others – their fragile coalition increasingly cracked and splintered across the decade leading up to 1968, and then it fell apart all at once.</p> \n<p>The backdrop was the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in late August, which turned into a raging circus as the streets around the International Amphitheater went up in flames. The internal rift led to a Republican election victory that fall, as Richard Nixon, citing the chaos on the left, promised to restore law and order to the country. But for many, Nixon was just a historic traffic accident, in which a divided left and two assassins were involved. If the assassination of John F. Kennedy mortally wounded the left in 1963, the murder of his brother Robert F. Kennedy, almost five years later, confirmed the kill.</p> \n<p>On March 31, 1968, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson dropped a political bombshell. The object of widespread hatred within his own party, Johnson announced that he would not seek another term of office. He wasn’t one to relinquish power voluntarily, but two weeks earlier his avowed rival, Bobby Kennedy, had announced that he would take part in the primaries for the Democratic nomination against the serving president. Kennedy, a U.S. senator from New York, had served as the attorney general in his older brother’s administration and was considered a force of nature in national politics at the ripe old age of 42. His tenure in the administration had forged the image of a tough, strong leader.</p> \n<p>In the wake of his brother’s assassination (which led to then-Vice President Johnson’s taking over as president) and elevation to mythical status, RFK seemed poised to become the leading candidate in whatever race he chose to enter. Above all, though, he seemed to many to be the most appropriate candidate to pull the Democratic Party back together at the historic, dramatic and revolutionary moment of the late 1960s.</p> \n<p>This was a period of accelerated social and cultural transformations, and RFK was the only one who had succeeded in unifying exploited farmworkers and young educated urbanites, and a full range in between. Though JFK had been more charismatic, Bobby projected the common touch, not least because he unhesitatingly positioned himself alongside people who hadn’t necessarily voted for him and demonstrated with them against people who were likely to be potential voters.</p> \n<p>The hope personified in RFK was aborted in a brief moment shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, just after he had been declared the winner of the key California primary. After delivering an optimistic victory speech in the hotel’s main ballroom, he began to make his way out of the building through the kitchen, where, far from the eyes of the media, he stopped to shake hands with a busboy and greet workers. Suddenly, a man named Sirhan Sirhan, 24, armed with a pistol, stepped forward and fired a volley of shots. Kennedy was mortally wounded and five other people were also hit by bullets.</p> \n<p>“Let me explain!” Sirhan shouted as he was subdued by a former FBI agent and others. “I did it for my country.” He was arrested and given a widely covered trial, but no one bothered to listen to him.</p> \n<p>Bobby Kennedy, who died the following day, underwent an apotheosis: from symbol of the idealistic left to a character in a Greek tragedy encompassing both a family and a nation. In this drama there was no place for Sirhan, who aroused two types of reactions. The majority viewed him as a madman whose rants were not even worth listening to, while the minority saw him as part of a larger conspiracy against Kennedy the revolutionary, and in any case considered him a mere puppet who had nothing of his own to say. The bottom line was the same in both cases: Sirhan’s opinions were of no interest to anyone.</p> \n<p>A new Netflix documentary series, “Bobby Kennedy for President,” paints a vivid portrait of the secret of the politician’s charm and of the vast emotional earthquake his assassination fomented. Kennedy touched deeply those who felt betrayed by the American dream; the four-part series shows his solidarity with their suffering and his ability to attract diverse groups, some of them conservative, with an openly liberal campaign that was characterized by cautious optimism. He represented the hope of the 1960s, and his assassination occurred just two months before the opening of the Democratic Party’s convention. Those who had looked forward to a victory celebration had to cope instead with the disintegration of the left-wing coalition in prime time, while Chicago burned.</p> \n<p>Amid the political, cultural and social turbulence known as “the Sixties,” the figure of Sirhan Sirhan was forgotten. In retrospect, it’s worth looking more closely at him, because he was a type of killer Americans would soon encounter more of. Even more interesting is that all the facts were known at the time, but people were blind to them. That’s logical, though, as historians insist that a distance of time is crucial for analyzing major developments and processes.</p> \n<p>For the sake of comparison: Will history ultimately show that U.S. President Donald Trump is a footnote in a liberal narrative whose hero is President Barack Obama, or will Obama go down as a footnote in the story of the rise of the right wing, in which Trump is the hero? Historical perspective – and of course the passage of time – is needed to answer that question, and 50 years after the assassination of RFK, the case of Sirhan Sirhan offers an excellent case for reexamination.</p> \n<p>Scarred in Jerusalem</p> \n<p>Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Palestinian Christian, was born in 1944 in Jerusalem’s Musrara neighborhood, opposite the Old City. He began to display psychological problems in early childhood, particularly during Israel’s War of Independence, which broke out when he was 3 years old. His mother, Mary Sirhan, told The Washington Post in 1979 how her son was scarred by the horrific scenes of fighting he witnessed in and around the Old City.</p> \n<p>In 1948, at the height of the events, when the city was divided in two, the family fled Musrara and moved to the Jordanian-controlled eastern section of the city, for fear of what life would be like under Jewish rule. Until the war, Musrara had been an affluent Palestinian neighborhood, and the family lived comfortably. Afterward, however, they were forced to share one house with nine families. Sirhan’s father, Bishara, lost his job.</p> \n<p>In 1956, when Sirhan was 12, the family received a special immigration permit issued by the United States to Palestinian refugees, and they settled in Pasadena, in Los Angeles. It is known that the son flirted with a variety of different religious philosophies.</p> \n<p>Immediately after his arrest, following the shooting, Sirhan told his captors that he had made the decision to kill Kennedy only three weeks earlier. On the radio, he had heard a speech delivered by the candidate during a visit to a synagogue, in which Kennedy promised to arm Israel with dozens of warplanes, calling it the lesson he’d learned from the Six-Day War a year earlier. A 2008 article in the Guardian quotes one of Sirhan’s relatives as saying that the assassin had actually been a great admirer of Kennedy, but that after hearing the synagogue speech he ran from the room with “his hands on his ears, and almost weeping.” In his interrogation, too, Sirhan explained that the date of the assassination was not accidental, that he had chosen it because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six-Day War.</p> \n<p>“To me he [Kennedy] was my hero, he was my champion,” Sirhan told British journalist David Frost during an interview at the state prison in Soledad, California, in 1989, one of only two television interviews he has given over the years. “He was the protector of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, and I felt that I was one [of those]. And to have him say that he was going to send 50 Phantom jets to Israel to deliver nothing but death and destruction on my countrymen, that seemed as though it were a betrayal, and it was sad for me to accept and it was hard for me to accept.”</p> \n<p>Researchers have shown an increasing interest in Sirhan in recent years, particularly against the background of such phenomena as Al-Qaida and ISIS. In a 2011 biography of Sirhan, “The Forgotten Terrorist,” Mel Ayton maintains that the prosecution deliberately chose to ignore evidence proving that this was the first American encounter with Middle Eastern terrorism. To prove his point, Ayton presented evidence, forensic findings and even a notebook in which Sirhan wrote the sentence “RFK must die,” obsessively, thousands of times, proof of premeditation on the assassin’s part.</p> \n<p>Ayton is probably right, but the harsh judgment about people not understanding the meaning of Sirhan’s Palestinian identity is unfair. It’s true that his origins and background, his cry of “for my country” immediately after the shooting and his official statements during his interrogation were not sufficient to change the prosecution’s presentation or alter the way Sirhan was publicly perceived. All the facts were known already during the trial, but they did not modify the narrative about a mad, brainwashed assassin, one that was widespread during the Cold War era.</p> \n<p>Sirhan’s case is a perfect example of a concept falling off the radar because of its newness. On the day of the assassination, June 5, 1968, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip was exactly one year old, and American interest in it was only minimally developed. The description “assassin of Arab origin” that clung to Sirhan was enough for Americans. Those who were interested in digging a little deeper classified him as a “Jordanian citizen” – because of his passport – but that was as far as interest in his identity went.</p> \n<p>Even within the Arab world, an action taken in the name of so-called Palestinian nationhood was a relatively novel idea. The Palestine Liberation Organization was new – it was only a year later that Yasser Arafat would take its reins – and few in the West had ever heard the word “Palestinian.” The assertion by Golda Meir, Israel’s prime minister at the time of the trial, that “there is no such thing as a Palestinian people” certainly did not help Sirhan’s being tagged as a political assassin with a national agenda.</p> \n<p>The tacit assumption of the period – with its burgeoning number of political movements, undergrounds and cells – was that a political murder was by definition an act committed under the auspices of an organization. But the PLO, for its part, denied any connection to Sirhan, and it wasn’t until the following decade that Palestinian organizations began to demand his release from prison.</p> \n<p>“My reaction and that of many people is that a crazy person could have had an infinite number of guiding forces and he just happened to have that one,” Peter Edelman, who was issues director of Kennedy’s campaign, told The Boston Globe in 2008. The same article quoted historian Steven Gillon as saying that Sirhan “was a Middle Eastern version of [JFK’s killer] Lee Harvey Oswald a lone gunman who wants to become famous by shooting a famous person” and not someone who is driven by political ideology. Sirhan simply did not meet the expectations of his contemporaries for what is now termed “lone-wolf terrorism.” After all, if a terrorist attack takes place in a forest but there’s no one to understand it as such, is it still a terrorist attack?</p> \n<p>Sirhan was there from the beginning, but the idea and the definition of the “lone wolf terrorist” were different. He was just another “madman,” not a calculating assassin acting out of ideology.</p> \n<p>In the 19th century, the “lone wolf” label was employed rarely, and when it was, it was to describe murderers with apparently arbitrary motives. Only in the wake of events in the 1990s did the “lone wolf” concept enter the public lexicon actively, with figures such as Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 people in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995, or in Israel, with the American-born Baruch Goldstein, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron a year earlier. The American authorities became increasingly fearful of “domestic terrorism,” and particularly of solitary killers against whom it was difficult to defend. Only then were the resources made available to investigate their psychological profile in order to thwart future attempts.</p> \n<p>No fixed profile</p> \n<p>According to Dr. Paul Gill, a senior lecturer in security and crime science at University College London, research on the subject of individual terror acts is still in a fledgling state, and the phenomenon has yet to be fully identified and defined. In a 2015 lecture, Gill presented new data on the subject revealing that a lone-actor terrorist is 13 times more likely to be suffering from a mental illness than a group-based terrorist.</p> \n<p>Gill noted that researchers were surprised by the findings, which went “completely against what the psychology of terror literature was saying.” In fact, the earlier research showed that, only “about a third had been diagnosed with mental disorders before they [carried out] their attack.” However, “the vast majority of those studies were focused on group-based [terrorism].” Unemployment and addictions also tend to appear in these lone killers. In addition, the assumption that mental illness leads to spontaneous acts is not always correct, he noted, “because sometimes a disorder will help you act in a much more rational way.”</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that no distinct personality profile of a lone-actor ideological killer exists. Such individuals can be of any age, from a range of professions, and in effect from any background. What surprised Gill was the psychological resemblance they bear to individuals who perpetrate massacres at workplaces or in schools.</p> \n<p>“We really did expect to find major differences between the two,” Gill told the American PBS program “Frontline” in July 2016. “But our study shows that the behaviors they engage in, and their trajectory into violence, look really, really similar.” The main difference, apart from the political and ideological rage vs. personal/individual rage, is in the choice of venue: The nonpolitical killers tend to attack in a place they’re familiar with, whereas the political killers usually choose a place they didn’t know before. Gill subsumes both groups under one category, which he terms “grievance-field violence.”</p> \n<p>‘Burned the hell out of me’</p> \n<p>Sirhan, 74, is still in prison, and his statements over the years are consistent with the research conclusions. In his trial, nearly 50 years ago, he stated, “When you move a whole country, a whole people, bodily from their own homes, from their land, from their business, that is completely wrong. That burned the hell out of me.” Yet today, when public opinion may be better primed to accept his original motivation, but less inclined to forgive him, he offers an alternative explanation. The last time he appeared before the parole board, in 2016, he adopted a popular conspiracy theory and claimed he had been hypnotized when he shot Sen. Kennedy.</p> \n<p>It’s the same problem criminology was facing five decades ago, Gill noted in his lecture. In the past, he said, “The study of terrorism has a really big aggregate of problems, which criminology had about 50 years ago. They talked about the ‘criminal,’ but over time our understanding of the criminal became a lot more disaggregated. [We found that] what interests arsonists and influences them is very different from sexual offenders, very different from burglars. They have very different drivers: The behavior and the motivational underpinnings behind those crimes are very, very different There’s a different psychology involved. But we still talk about terrorism as a sort of aggregate problem. Yet what drives someone to be a suicide bomber might be very different from someone who is a financier for a terrorist organization, but we treat them all as ‘terrorists.’” In short, he concluded, a more complex understanding of these phenomena is needed.</p> \n<p>In the years that have passed since September 11, 2001, the period from Al-Qaida to ISIS, the prevalent image of the lone wolf has been detached from the extreme right – even though most of the solitary assassins in the United States continue to come from that part of society – and become associated with the Muslim world. That shift has engendered a readiness to investigate the lone murderers, after years in which they were generally categorized as “madmen,” without further examination. Still, even now, although there is a more serious consideration of motives in such cases, it is often accompanied by the old approach that looks for the person pulling the strings: Perhaps there’s a large organization behind the lone actor; perhaps such people have undergone “online radicalization,” as is usually said of ISIS terrorists. For instance, when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel rammed into and killed 84 people in Nice on Bastille Day 2016, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve stated, “This is a new type of attack. We are now confronted with individuals that are sensitive to the message of ISIS and are committed to extremely violent actions without necessarily being trained by them.”</p> \n<p>Madness or conspiracy are convenient explanations for public opinion; belief in a tragic fate, as in the case of the Kennedy family, is sometimes easier to accept. However we define Sirhan – Palestinian terrorist or American psychopath – what’s scary is precisely the rational motives that drove him. Journalists, like many readers, find it difficult to accept the thought that an individual with a pistol and sufficient malice can divert history from its course.</p> \n<p>The assassination of Robert Kennedy left the Democrats without an obvious candidate going into the Chicago convention. Finally, it was the bland vice president, Hubert Humphrey, who was nominated as a compromise candidate, even though he hadn’t run in the primaries. On November 5, 1968, with the Democratic Party in a shambles, Richard Nixon defeated Humphrey. The latter made a brief statement: “I have done my best. I have lost, Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, a (formerly) Israeli offensive cybertechnology firm, NSO Group, is about to be bought by another Israeli company, Verint Systems, for about a billion dollars. The transaction, if completed, would create one of the world’s largest cyber companies, Reuters reported on Monday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The deal remains pending, but here are some things worth knowing:</p> \n<p>1. NSO was founded in 2009 by Niv Carmi, Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie. Its name comes from their first initials, although Carmi isn’t involved in the company any more. Unlike other cybersecurity companies, such as the Israeli firm Check Point Software Technologies or Palo Alto Networks, NSO doesn’t deal with data security. It sells offensive software and spyware to governments and law enforcement and espionage agencies.</p> \n<p>2. In March 2014, the equity fund Francisco Partners acquired NSO at a company value of $170 million. It also bought another offensive (as opposed to defensive) Israeli cybertechnology firm called Circles, reportedly for $130 million. NSO specializes in tapping mobile phones. Circles specializes in surveillance and location – finding people through nothing but their phone numbers.</p> \n<p>As an equity fund, Francisco’s business is buying companies, improving them and flipping them, meaning selling them at a profit. Francisco is merging NSO and Circles into one big cyberespionage company, a process that’s still under way. Verint will be buying the merged company, assuming the deal is finalized.</p> \n<p>3. In fact, Francisco has been working at flipping NSO since about a year after buying it, for about a billion dollars. A year ago, rumors had it that Blackstone was eyeing 40% of the company for $400 million, but Blackstone took flak, including from human rights organizations that reminded it of its commitment to making ethical investments. It quickly backed off.</p> \n<p>4. This is a good point to note that by any measure, NSO is a weapons company. In 2016, Citizen Lab accused it of selling sophisticated systems to oppressive regimes to keep tabs on human rights activists, journalists and others. For example, NSO was suspected of selling spyware to infect iPhones, essentially turning them into mobile spies on their owners.</p> \n<p>5. When it comes to Verint, buying digital snooping companies sounds like a risky business. There’s good money in detecting weaknesses. “Vulnerability bounties” can involve serious amounts. In 2016, for instance, Zerodium offered $1.5 million for the Apple iPhone’s vulnerabilities.</p> \n<p>One snag is that vulnerabilities age quickly. The affected companies find solutions and release patches. Sometimes a vulnerability gets exposed before even a single black-hat hacker manages to exploit it. For a publicly traded company to put a billion dollars into the offensive cyberware business sounds risky.</p> \n<p>6. Verint is worth $2.7 billion on Wall Street and as of year-end 2017 (the last figure on record), it had cash and equivalents worth $338 million. It should be noted that in June 2014, it bought Kana (a customer service software firm) for $514 million. That deal seems to have had no effect on its revenues, which remained about $1.1 billion a year. It remains to be seen how the new deal, if consummated, will be digested.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sandwiches are nice. Pizza is fun. Grilled meat on skewers is classic. But none of these standbys sparks anywhere near the level of buzz that builds up whenever a new hamburger joint opens in this town.</p> \n<p>If you happened to spend the last couple of years in a cave, I’ve got news for you – Tel Aviv is teeming with hamburger places. Suddenly, everyone’s doing hamburgers. Chefs who not so long ago looked down on this humble food started making their own special versions.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, you can toss a hamburger bun anywhere in Tel Aviv and it’s bound to hit a hamburger.</p> \n<p>With a reasonable or better burger to be found almost everywhere now, from fancy restaurants to fast food joints, we decided to return to our roots and to this column’s true purpose – examining what exactly is happening in the Tel Aviv street food scene.</p> \n<p>In honor of International Hamburger Day which falls this week, we decided to rank – once and for all – the best hamburgers in Tel Aviv. Well, at least in the opinion of this write – and in the street food category. That’s why excellent hamburgers like the ones at Hudson, Ha’achim and Ya Pan don’t appear on the list. In the same spirit, we also did not include the hamburger chains, but rather on small places where the hamburger is the loving focus. Not just a restaurant that has a hamburger on the menu, but a true hamburger joint.</p> \n<p>So, with no further ado, I present you “The Top Ten hamburgers in Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>10th place: Ad Ha’etzem Express</p> \n<p>In an age where few places are opening that specialize in just one thing, Ad Ha’etzem Express is a refreshing restaurant with one main, simple concept – thin, small hamburgers (120 grams): one or two or three in a soft bun with a choice of toppings (cheese, onion, sunny-side-up egg), a generous portion of fries and a drink with free refills. Bottom line: We can happily report that every part of this equation is quite solid.</p> \n<p>The prices – which are lower than all the other hamburger places in town – haven’t changed at all in the years since it opened, and that’s also something to appreciate. More importantly, the quality has been more or less preserved too. Nice? Yes. Tasty? Definitely. Cheap? Relatively. Cool? If you’re a certain age. Does the trick? For sure.</p> \n<p>Ad Ha’etzem Express. 21 Ibn Gvirol st., 77 King George st., Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Opening hours: Sunday-Wednesday 12 P.M. - 3 P.M. / Sat-Thurs 12 A.M. - 4: 30 P.M.</p> \n<p>9th place: Captain</p> \n<p>Captain, a diner specializing in burgers and fries, made a smart move by opening its first Tel Aviv branch (the original restaurant is in Jerusalem) in the least Tel Aviv-like spot in Tel Aviv: Hapil Junction. The distance from the city center serves Captain well in some ways (obscures its weak spots, or at least makes them more tolerable, given the lack of nearby alternatives), but it also makes it harder to draw people who might make a special trip to go there. A few minor improvements in the food, though, and it could happen.</p> \n<p>Captain. 280 Bnei Efraim st., Tel Aviv-Yafo. Phone: 03-6917593</p> \n<p>Opening hours: Sun-Thursday and Saturdays 11 A.M – 1 P.M. Fridays 11 A.M – 6 P.M</p> \n<p>8th place: Memphis</p> \n<p>The hamburger here can go head to head with the best burgers in the city. Excellent beef in a well-balanced patty that’s juicy but not bursting with fat, and has a slightly coarse texture that preserves the original flavors and doesn’t flatten or obscure them. The lack of spices and onion is all for the good, as there is nothing to detract from the thing itself. The result is a terrific hamburger that gets support from a soft, sweet, lightly toasted bun that can also hold its ground against its finest counterparts in Tel Aviv. And this hamburger is kosher, too.</p> \n<p>Memphis. 20 Carlebach st., Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Opening hours: Sun-Wed 12 P.M – 12 A.M, Thursdays 12 P.M. until the last customer</p> \n<p>7th place: Susu and Sons</p> \n<p>This is one of the most popular hamburgers in Tel Aviv in the last few years. The main reason: Chef Omer Miller. The hamburger patties here (the beef comes from the Meat Market butcher shop) are fantastic: meaty, juicy, delectable, perfectly grilled. They were so good that we somewhat regretted going for the smaller burger on the menu. It’s a mistake that a lot of people probably make at this place. The toppings and various hamburger combinations steal most of the attention here, tempting you to try them at the expense of the main attraction. But take heed and try to restrain yourselves.</p> \n<p>Susu and Sons. 6 Herzl st. (corner of Rothschild Boulevard), Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Opening hours: all week, 12 P.M until the last customer (will operate 24/7 in the future)</p> \n<p>6th place: Little Burger Shop</p> \n<p>This is a small stall and the aroma of grilling wafts out of its half-open kitchen. There’s a counter for placing orders and a few seats outdoors. The location, in the middle of Dizengoff Street, isn’t bad. There are a lot of bars on this stretch, so despite the proliferation of hamburger places in the city, another quick food option in the area will surely be welcomed. Each hamburger comes with three toppings at no extra charge. This spares you the extra price calculations and a burger that gets more expensive with each topping, and also makes something of a game out of which combination of toppings you’ll choose, prompting you to want to come back and try something different the next time. And we haven’t even said anything yet about the Heston Blumenthal inspired burger.</p> \n<p>The Little Burger Shop. 125 Dizengoff St., Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Phone: 052-8746833. Opening hours: 12 P.M to the last customer</p> \n<p>5th place: Meat Bar Burger</p> \n<p>At Meat Bar Burger, as the name implies, they serve just one thing. With one topping. The only choices you have are whether to put cheese on top and whether to ask for the mayonnaise-hot pepper sauce. Next to some of the more elaborate hamburger places in the city, this seems kind of paltry at first. Here they believe that the quality of the burger (200 grams) can do the job alone. So kudos to Meat Bar Burger – The burgers here were perfectly grilled to just the right level of doneness, they had a pleasing texture, were juicy and especially flavorful.</p> \n<p>Meat Bar Burger is inside the Sharona Market (Aluf Kalman Magen St 3, Tel Aviv-Yafo)</p> \n<p>The market operates seven days a week: Sun-Thurs 9 A.M.- 10 P.M Fridays and holiday eves 8 A.M - 5 P.M Saturdays and on holidays 9A.M. - 11 P.M.</p> \n<p>4th place: Port 19</p> \n<p>There are makeovers that are very successful, and repeat visits that hold pleasant surprises, and such was the case when we visited Port 19. I ordered the “Swiss burger” – a hamburger coated in Emmental cheese and fried bacon bits, and topped with lamb bacon. This was one of the biggest culinary surprises I’ve had lately. It was really one of the best burgers in town. So when you’re keeping a list in your head of Tel Aviv’s best and most popular burgers, make sure to add Port 19 Meat Shack now too.</p> \n<p>Port 19. 2 Shlomo ha-Melekh St., Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Opening hours: Sunday-Thursday: 11 A.M. - 12 A.M. Fridays and holiday eves: 11 A.M. - 4 P.M. Saturdays and holidays: 11:30 A.M. - 1 P.M.</p> \n<p>3rd place: America Burgers</p> \n<p>At America Burgers, they don’t want you to feel like you’re at the corner of Allenby and Ahad Ha’am. Take one step into this not-so-big diner – a bar, a few tables, one couch along the wall – and you get the sense you’ve been in this place, or somewhere like it, before. Not in Tel Aviv; maybe in Brooklyn, or Paris, or Berlin. And it works. If you’re looking for signs of progress and improvement in Tel Aviv street food, America Burgers is a wonderful example.</p> \n<p>America Burgers. Allenby St 112, Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Phone:&nbsp;03-528-0281. Opening hours: Sunday-Thursday and Saturday: 6 P.M - 1 A.M.</p> \n<p>2nd place: Prozdor</p> \n<p>The people at Prozdor are only interested in one thing – hamburgers. Specifically, the 16 different hamburgers served here where burgers are the only main dish on the menu. With two obvious exceptions (the vegetarian burger based on a leek-beet patty, and the vegan burger made from portobello mushrooms), they all have the same starting point – a 150-gram beef burger. But from here they go in all kinds of directions, as far as names and the toppings they get, which can be slightly dizzying. Three different hamburgers were sampled and each was delicious in its own way. This 100-percent success rate was no statistical fluke.</p> \n<p>Prozdor.&nbsp;Mendele Mokher Sfarim St 6, Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Phone:&nbsp;03-5233223. Opening hours: Everyday 6 P.M. - 12 A.M.</p> \n<p>1st place: Vitrina Lili</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv hype usually wears off after a while, but the hype surrounding Vitrina Lili hasn’t subsided; it’s only grown. So much so, that at some point it threatened to overwhelm and drown the place. Even the restaurant’s most devoted regular customers started to qualify their experience there with a “yes, but” The long lines, the crowds, the difficulty getting service. But the final result is still worth it, even if getting in is sometimes a tad difficult.</p> \n<p>Vitrina Lili.&nbsp;Lilienblum St 40, Tel Aviv-Yafo</p> \n<p>Phone:&nbsp;03-696-0304ץ Opening hours: Sunday-Wednesday: 12 P.M. - 11 P.M. Thursdays: 12 P.M. - 12 A.M. Closed on Fridays and Saturdays&nbsp;</p>",

You can love amba, you can hate it, but you definitely cannot ignore it or its potent smell, which stems from a mixture of fenugreek, vinegar, turmeric and mango (&quot;amba,&quot; means mango in the Indian language of Marathi).</p> \n<p>The origin of amba reflects tortuous foodways across the Indian Ocean. The common urban legend is that it was invented in the late 19th century by members of the Baghdadi-born Sassoon family of Bombay, whose discovery of the mango led them to send barrels of it, coated in vinegar, to Basra port, thus confirming its role in the story of the Jewish culinary diaspora, with roots in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Remaining persistent in form and ingredients over the years, amba took global leaps across diasporic communities, while assuming different meanings and uses in the process. Israelis will often tell you it is Indian, even though Mumbai’s Jewish community typically eat locally made chutneys and pickles instead. In the Arabian Gulf, in a manner that’s similar to the way many Indian cuisines use pickles, it is eaten with rice yet retains the name amba.</p> \n<p>Since Iraqi immigrants brought amba to Israel in the 1950s to accompany the traditional Shabbat morning meal (eggs cooked overnight with eggplant), it has penetrated Israeli and Palestinian cuisine and made its way into Mediterranean-style restaurants around the world. In the 1980s, it skipped to being a sauce accompanying shawarma and falafel, balancing their fattiness through its savory-sourness. Today, a quintessential ingredient in street food in Israel, amba is served in many restaurants along with tahini; some people even add it to French fries in the form of spicy ketchup.</p> \n<p>At the Hatikva market in south Tel Aviv, where homemade kubbeh with amba is served in the stalls, a delicatessen owned by the Ofer family – whose members claim that their grandfather was the first to bring amba to Israel – can be found alongside a shop selling delicacies that’s owned by the Turkish Amiga family. In Or Yehuda, in central Israel, there is “Little Iraq,” which markets “original Iraqi amba.”</p> \n<p>During the 1991 Gulf War, when some of Saddam Hussein’s Scuds fell on Iraqi neighborhoods in Ramat Gan, the joke was that the missiles had targeted these areas because of the strong smell of amba.</p> \n<p>In contrast to hummus and falafel, however, amba has never been politicized as a “national” Israeli food, per se. It continues to be marketed primarily as something that’s authentically Iraqi or Indian – not as a bona fide Israeli product. But it continues to be a marker of Iraqi-Jewish Diaspora identity, with the aromas of homemade versions still permeating those households. Moreover, despite or maybe due to its apparent Iraqi roots, amba has been adopted in food stalls on Arab streets both inside and outside the Green Line in Israel, not to mention further afield.</p> \n<p>Highly popular restaurants specializing in modern Israeli or Middle Eastern cuisine (depending on who you ask) are now an important part of the culinary landscape in many of the world’s cities, and amba is often featured on their menus. At Zahav in Philadelphia, award-winning Israeli-born chef Michael Solomonov includes amba in a sabih dish (Iraqi-style eggplant sandwich) with heirloom tomatoes, as well as with fermented cauliflower stems, turmeric and beet-brined egg. Chef Meir Adoni’s NYC Nur offers horias – lamb kebab grilled in pita and served with eggplant, amba and market salad.</p> \n<p>After following a winding route that has led to the United States and to Europe from India, Iraq and Israel/Palestine, you can also find amba in London, thanks to the rising popularity of Israeli and Middle Eastern cuisine there. Local Palestinian restaurants are serving it alongside falafel, observes Jewish-Iraqi food scholar Sami Zubaida. At a number of local eateries, some opened by Israeli-born chefs, it is served in a variety of dishes: At Ottolenghi, it is combined with a Greek yogurt sauce and served with lamb kebabs, grilled chicken or fried; at a foodie favorite brunch spot called the Good Egg, it is part of a bacon sandwich; and it is mixed with labneh and yogurt at the Palomar and her sister restaurant, the Barbary, which won top spot in the recent TimeOut list of the best 50 restaurants in London.</p> \n<p>Eyal Jagermann, the Israeli-born head chef of the Barbary, tells us that, “Amba is one of my favorite topics. Firstly, I grew up on it; it’s in my blood, as much as tahini and hummus.” If prepared correctly, the flavor of the pickled condiment, which he describes as “ultra-hyperactive, supercharged, out of this world,” just “transcends, in several dishes.”</p> \n<p>Amba, says Jagermann, has become one of the most substantial ingredients in London’s emerging new Middle Eastern cuisine. The new Iraqi pop-up, Juma, serves it as a salsa-like accompaniment to torched mackerel, or as a dip alongside Aleppo-style kibbeh.</p> \n<p>The key to the so-called gourmetization of amba, according to Israeli-born chef Avinadav Levy, was Michelin-star chef Jo&euml;l Robuchon, who took to amba and carried a sample back to Europe following a visit to Israel, during Jerusalem’s 3000th year celebrations, in 1996. In his atelier Robuchon serves a dish of egg, eggplant and lemon, with coriander seeds that seems to have an amba-and-sabih quality.</p> \n<p>‘Crazy mix’</p> \n<p>We spoke to several leading Jewish and Arab chefs in Israel in order to get a take on local, contemporary cuisine through its use of amba. In upscale kitchens the condiment has apparently undergone a conversion from a dominant sauce to a spice. Speaking from Japan, chef Meir Adoni explains that, “in New York we use amba as a spice and as a raw material for all purposes, just like soy and ginger Amba is the Middle Eastern equivalent of umami. It’s all because of the hilbeh (fenugreek paste), which creates a crazy mixture of emotions and flavors. It’s addictive and for me it’s one of the flavors that are identified with who we are in the Middle East.”</p> \n<p>At his restaurants in Jerusalem and in London, Assaf Granit says he serves an amba paste, made with labneh mixed into it. He also uses amba as a spice for fish and fresh vegetable dishes, as well as in the famous Jerusalem mixed grill.</p> \n<p>Granit: “Amba is a very precise indicator of our cuisine in Israel. Nearly everything we call modern Israeli cuisine is a result of crossing one boundary or another. This refers to different waves of immigration, different neighborhoods in major cities and to different communities. There are many such influences that create dishes or specific food cultures, and amba is an amazing example of this. Here in Israel it took root mainly as a spice for grilled internal organs (liver or Jerusalem mixed grill), beyond its home use as a paste. The wider public recognizes it as a flavor, as a kind of umami. It enhances everything with its intensity.”</p> \n<p>The use of amba highlights two extremes of contemporary Israeli cuisine: On one hand is the expansive and eclectic cuisine of Adoni and Granit, who link different worlds in new ways, such as in Middle Eastern kimchi – while on the other hand, there is the unique cuisine of Eyal Shani, who seeks to “refine the flavor, to distill it to its maximal effect.”</p> \n<p>Serving as a marker of heritage and belonging, while at other times as a more universal commodity devoid of social content, amba has never yielded a political myth of origin. It does not provoke the same nationalistic fervor evident in the so-called, notorious hummus wars, perhaps because its genesis has more recent and humble origins. Thus amba has become part of the culinary consensus, disseminating its aroma everywhere without hinting at a narrow political “agenda.”</p> \n<p>“Hummus,” writes culture researcher Dafna Hirsch, “is an emotionally charged product which has followed an interesting path: from a Palestinian dish which was hardly known in Jewish society, it has become one of the ultimate markers of Israeliness.”</p> \n<p>Easily passed over political hurdles</p> \n<p>From where he sits in the United States, Avinadav Levy is optimistic about the future of amba. “I believe we’ll be seeing molecular dishes with amba, such as sabih with amba caviar or amba gelatin or amba sorbet wrapped in eggplant, and maybe even more than that What’s certain is that the more popular amba becomes, the more uses will be made of it.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, this phenomenon is already apparent in Israel, in local Arab cuisine at that. One of the flagship dishes served by chef Omar Alwan, at Haifa’s Garden Restaurant, is Zahra mekleyah: fried cauliflower spiced with lemon and served on a bed of tahini, amba jelly and tahini powder. Alwan, one of the leaders of what is called Arab molecular gastronomy, sanctifies scientific precision in the kitchen and defines his cooking as “delicate fusion,” based on Al-Sham cuisine (i.e., originating in the greater Syria area). For his part Alwan believes that amba originated in Egypt, the mango empire, and was transported along the historic rail line linking Alexandria and Aleppo, passing through the Gaza Strip. “It has a biting taste, a bittersweet one. It’s sharp and sweet at the same time,” he observes. “I have no problem introducing it to a chef’s kitchen.”</p> \n<p>For Salah Kurdi from Jaffa (formerly of the al-Ashi restaurant), amba also seems to have easily passed over various possible, political hurdles. “I was once asked how Israeliness has affected Palestinian cuisine. I replied that this happened when we started seeing hummus in the ‘fridge at home. Even though it’s a national Palestinian food we were exposed to it only once a week, on Saturdays at the local hummus eatery.”</p> \n<p>Adds Kurdi, “Amba rolled into our lives but no one is claiming ownership over it. I can’t say that when I cook Arab Palestinian dishes amba is an authentic component. Amba is my Israeliness.”</p> \n<p>Daniel Monterescu is an anthropologist of urban matters, food and wine.

        "text":["<p>The Haoman 17 nightclub in south Tel Aviv, typically a hangout for young, techno-loving, alcohol-fueled gay club-goers, hosted an unusual event last Saturday. As the lights dimmed, thousands of young men and women crowded onto the dance floor, in eager anticipation of some of the best Palestinian fringe acts performing here as part of the first “Roots of Art” festival.</p> \n<p>The festival organizers – Ramle businessmen Jalil Dabit and Alfred Sousou – said it was the first time prominent figures from the scene have all appeared together simultaneously in the same place. Time will tell whether it's the first in a new series or just a one-off.</p> \n<p>A kind of &quot;attendance-taking&quot; was conducted via a&nbsp;giant screen: Each time the name of an Israeli city appeared on screen, members of the audience would cheer for their hometown. Tel Aviv was not represented, but Jaffa, Nazareth, Haifa and Eilabun (a small Arab town near Safed) all were.</p> \n<p>As it turns out, Haifa and Nazareth are currently the two most important cities in the local Arab music scene, the former as the center for electronic music and nightlife, and the latter for its indie pop music.</p> \n<p>The evening was opened by Zenobia, an instrumental electronic dabke duo from Haifa. Over the past year, Zenobia has played parties in Jerusalem, Haifa and even Ramallah.</p> \n<p>The duo’s two members, Nasser Halahlih and Isam Elias, perform in keffiyehs, headbands and dark sunglasses, a look modeled, none too subtly, on Omar Souleyman. But with all due respect to the king of Syrian wedding music, who is credited with reviving the genre, the Haifa duo is dabke’s future. They play multiple keyboards and create a dabke with a dash of Levantine acid. The experience is terrific and faithful to the original.</p> \n<p>Yet Zenobia particularly shone when it slowed the rhythm and speed of the traditional dance and switched to a house-oriented beat. For about an hour, they played their lengthy, synthesized mantras over a chunky beat that put the club’s amplifiers to the test.</p> \n<p>To date, they have released only one song officially, and from the excitement on their faces and the way they built their set, it was clear that they’re still a little green. Nevertheless, if they polish their performance a bit, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t succeed abroad. People overseas are crying out for authentic music like this, and they could make it without taking the Tel Aviv nightclub route.</p> \n<p>Between performances, the Haifa DJ SuperMike performed for the crowd. He began with Arab music with a reggaeton feel and then switched to a set that included modern hits and big names like DJ Zeki’s “Europe the Lebanese”; East Jerusalem rapper Muhammad Mughrabi, who performs under the name Jabid; and “Intro to Shamstep” by the Palestinian-Jordanian group 47Soul.</p> \n<p>The latter group is also familiar to Israeli Jews, and quite a few Israeli producers would probably be happy to host it here. When its piece was played, there wasn’t a person in the club who didn’t recognize it.</p> \n<p>Later in the evening, the charismatic rapper Saz performed with his troupe, as did the Nazareth-base groove/pop/reggae band Ghazali. The latter was noteworthy both for its captivating bass and the infectious joie de vivre of its soloist.</p> \n<p>Immediately afterward, the group Apo and the Apostles performed. It was founded by Apo Sahagian, an Armenian resident of Jerusalem. The festival then closed with rapper Tamer Nafar of Lod and his veteran group Dam.</p> \n<p>Jalil Dabit, the event’s co-producer, told Haaretz prior to the festival that it “isn’t political.” Nevertheless, his decision to hold it in Tel Aviv could be seen as making a strong political statement of trying to break through the walls of the occupation and take a stand against the fear that many Jews feel of the Arabic language, which silences, or at least weakens, the spectacular Palestinian music that has sprung up here in recent years.</p> \n<p>The festival is proof that there is demand for musical events like this even outside Arab or mixed cities. Audience members, who paid the non-negligible price of 130 to 160 shekels ($36-$44) per ticket, voted with its feet.</p> \n<p>In 1968, the first “rhythm festival” took place at the Tel Aviv Cinerama Club. According to people who were present, politician and activist Uri Avnery, who was at the time an MK, opened the evening with a speech in praise of rhythm as an international movement that bridged the ocean and brought together young people from around the world, addressing himself to young Israelis whose sights were set on music from overseas.</p> \n<p>Fifty years later, young Israelis are already well connected to the world. But most are still not connected to the music and musicians that have sprung up an hour’s drive from Tel Aviv.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli media usually takes scant interest in Robert Mueller’s investigations. It prefers to dwell on Donald Trump’s supposedly pro-Israeli policies. Last week’s report in the New York Times about the participation of Joel Zamel, the Australian-born “Israeli specialist in social media manipulation,” in an August 3, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York was an exception to the rule. The FBI, the Times reported, had even come to Israel to search the offices of Zamel’s company. Here was a direct Israeli link to the scandal that has bewitched much of America since Trump was first elected.</p> \n<p>To really understand Trump, Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The moment of fleeting interest was followed up by a report, published by Walla! News, that another Israeli-based company called Inspiration, run by former IDF intelligence officers, had been employed by a super PAC that supported Trump’s election. The report alleged that after retiring from the race, Housing Secretary and then-candidate Ben Carson personally presented Trump with Inspiration’s plan for voter manipulation in swing states. A source in the company told Walla! that Inspiration had received “enormous amounts” of information from the Super PAC, which it then used to compose strategies and slogans that would elevate Trump and “float all kinds of things” about Hillary Clinton.</p> \n<p>The two separate cases of Israeli involvement fed into sometimes anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that seek to place Israel on the same level as Russia in its intervention in the 2016 presidential elections. In Israel’s case, however, there is no indication or allegation of direct government involvement or of Mueller’s interest. Nonetheless, beyond Zamel and Inspiration, a disturbing number of the main players implicated so far in Mueller’s investigation, many of them of Russian origin, have a direct link to Israel in their past or present.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Who is Joel Zamel, the Australian-Israeli linked to Mueller’s Trump Probe?</p> \n<p>There could be myriad reasons for the preponderance of actors with ties to Israel. In recent years, Israeli political strategists have developed an international reputation for election campaigns; many are employed by foreign political parties. Israeli intelligence services have certainly developed an expertise in psychological warfare; both Zamel and Inspiration are said to have employed former intelligence officers. And an estimated 10-15 percent of the million or so Russian immigrants who came to Israel from the 1970s onwards are known to have used the country as a way station to immigrate to the United States and other Western countries – but not before picking up Israeli citizenship, which remains with them for life. These included so-called Russian oligarchs, some of whom made their fortunes on the wrong side of the law.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, there is no denying that Benjamin Netanyahu’s government was overjoyed at Trump’s election – if not before the fact, then certainly after. According to reports published in November and December of last year, Mueller is investigating lobbying efforts made in December 2016, before Trump’s inauguration, by former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and presidential adviser Jared Kushner against the Obama administration’s intention to refrain from vetoing UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Flynn’s indictment included an admission that he had lied to the FBI about his approach to Russia’s U.S. Ambassador Sergei Kislyak to delay the Security Council vote.</p> \n<p>And while no direct link has been established, there was certainly a confluence of views and interests in the recently uncovered efforts by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to assist Trump’s campaign. According to the New York Times, in the August 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, the UAE representative, George Nader, told Donald Trump Jr. and other participants that Obama had left a “power vacuum” in the Middle East. The report also states that Nader had concocted a secret plan to destabilize the Iranian regime, an objective now being pursued, despite their denials, by both Israel and the United States.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Explained:&nbsp;What Michael Flynn’s guilty plea means for Jared Kushner and Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;Ronan Farrow: Israelis, like Russia, are interfering in American politics&nbsp;■&nbsp;Analysis:&nbsp;Netanyahu puts Israel’s fate in hands of U.S president dubbed ‘serious threat to national security’</p> \n<p>The question of whether the Israeli involvement was merely coincidental or an indication of something more sinister could become clearer if and when Mueller presents his findings. In the meantime, here is a necessarily incomplete catalog of the numerous Israeli connections to some of the people named so far in Mueller’s probe:</p> \n<p>* George Nader, the convicted pedophile who worked on behalf of UAE, is a Lebanese businessman who has worked for decades in the shadows of Middle East diplomacy. He has often been accused in the Arab press of being an agent for the Mossad.&nbsp; In the 1980s, Nader reportedly mediated between Israel and Lebanon. At the same time, he established the journal Middle East Insight, which often arranged meetings in Washington between Israelis and Arabs. In July, 1996, Nader hosted Netanyahu shortly after his first election as prime minister. This video shows both on the same stage.</p> \n<p>Two years later, Nader forged even closer ties with Netanyahu and his bureau: he served as Ronald Lauder’s assistant in the cosmetic tycoon’s failed efforts to secure a peace deal between Netanyahu and Syria's president at the time, Hafez Assad. Netanyahu’s advisers have acknowledged their contacts with Nader, who is said to have been especially close to Dore Gold, the prime minister’s aide and former UN ambassador.</p> \n<p>* Nader’s partner in representing the UAE – and in pressing Trump to take a hard line on Qatar – was Elliott Broidy, the Los Angeles venture capitalist and GOP fundraiser. &nbsp;Broidy made headlines in recent weeks for his lucrative lobbying efforts on behalf of the UAE, which included two personal meetings with Trump, as well as for his alleged role in Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s payment of $1.6 million to former Playboy Playmate Shera Bechard. Many commentators assume that it was Trump who actually had an affair with Bechard and got her pregnant, with Broidy volunteering to serve as his cover.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Broidy also has a long history with Israel in general and Netanyahu in particular. Together with Sheldon Adelson, he is a prominent member of the board of directors of the Republican Jewish Coalition, which has taken hawkish positions on the Iran nuclear deal and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Fifteen years ago, Broidy set up Markstone Capital Group which operated in Israel, investing in Israeli companies and attracting Israeli investors. In 2003, then-Finance Minister Netanyahu took credit for convincing the New York State pension fund to invest $250 million in Markstone. It later emerged that Broidy’s bribes to former New York State Comptroller and now-convicted felon Alan Hevesi also played a role in the pension fund’s largesse. By the time Broidy pled guilty to a misdemeanor after cooperating with Hevesi’s investigators in 2012, Markstone's Israeli branch had essentially collapsed, taking with it the many Israelis' investments.</p> \n<p>* In January 2017, Nader took part in a meeting in Seychelles, which is also being probed by Mueller. In attendance were Erik Prince, Trump confidante, brother of Education Secretary Betsy Devos and founder of the security company Blackwater, as well as Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian government’s sovereign wealth fund Russia Direct Investment Fund. Dmitriev's fund has in recent months been negotiating with Israeli government ministers on a $100 million project to open Israeli-run dairies in Russia.</p> \n<p>* Russian lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya, who features in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, in which she is alleged to have offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton, represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd. in the money laundering case brought forth by former New York Southern District Attorney Preet Bharara. After Bharara was dismissed by Trump, Prevezon was allowed to pay a $6 million fine in May 2017 to avoid criminal prosecution. The owner of Prevezon is Denis Katsyv, another Israeli citizen, whose father Pyotr was a high municipal official in Moscow. In 2005, the same Katsyv reached a similar settlement with Israeli authorities, paying a fine of 35 million shekels after being indicted for money laundering at a Tel Aviv branch of Bank Hapoalim. The Cyprus-registered Prevezon was managed for a while by a Tel Aviv lawyer, who also represented the Russian Embassy in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>* Katsyv partnered with the Dutch branch of Africa-Israel Ltd., which belongs to Russian-Israeli diamond and real estate mogul Lev Leviev. Leviev’s apartments in New York were alleged to have served as a conduit for Prevezon’s money laundering. In 2015, Leviev sold four stories of the old New York Times building in Manhattan to Jared Kushner for $295 million, secured through a loan from Deutsche Bank, which is also being probed by Mueller.</p> \n<p>* Leviev and Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club who has recently run into visa problems with British authorities, teamed up in 1999 to set up the Federation of Jewish Communities in Russia (FOR). They were responding to a request by Vladimir Putin to set up a group that would rival the Russian Jewish Congress, headed by Israeli-Russian oligarch Vladimir Gusinsky, who was close to former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The head of the FOR is Italian-Russian Chabad Rabbi Berel Lazar. In April 2017, Politico alleged that Chabad and FOR were used by the Kremlin as conduits for their efforts to influence the U.S. elections. The report was denied and even dismissed as anti-Semitic. Interestingly, a BBC story published this week about payments made to Michael Cohen by Ukraine in order to secure a long White House meeting with Trump for Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko notes that the approach to Trump’s lawyer was made through attendees at a&nbsp; Chabad function in Port Washington, New York.</p> \n<p>* Mueller is also said to be investigating connections between Russian oligarchs and Trump’s businesses in the years before he became president. One such partner in Trump’s failed Soho tower was the late Israeli-Georgian tycoon Tamir Sapir. In 2007, Trump hosted the wedding of Sapir’s daughter, Zina, with Rotem Rosen, then the director of the North American branch of Leviev’s Africa-Israel. The same year, Netanyahu listed Sapir as one of the potential donors to his Likud primary campaign in a handwritten note uncovered by the Yedioth Aharonoth daily.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Delve deeper into the week's news: Sign up to Chemi Shalev's weekly roundup</p> \n<p>* Another partner in the Soho project, and possibly the architect of Trump’s ties to Russia, was Felix Sater, who worked closely with Cohen. Sater is also an Israeli citizen, having passed through the country on his way to the United States with his father Mikhail, whom the FBI has named as a lieutenant for Russia mafia kingpin Sergei Mogilevich. Mogilevich came to Israel in 1990 and lived there for a few years. According to press reports, Mogilevich participated in a 1995 meeting of Ukrainian master criminals convened in Tel Aviv by another Russian oligarch with a shady reputation, Boris Birshtein. After several years in Israel, Birshtein left the country for Canada, after learning that he had turned into a target of the Israeli police. Subsequently, he partnered with Trump in a building project in Toronto.</p> \n<p>* Mueller is also said to be investigating a $150,000 contribution to Trump’s inaugural committee, in which Broidy played an active role, made by another Ukrainian billionaire, Victor Pinchuk. Cohen, it is alleged, was the middleman. Pinchuk is a significant contributor to religious institutions in Israel, but is also well connected to its politicians. In 2008 he served as co-chairman of the Israeli Presidential Conference convened in Jerusalem by the late Shimon Peres.</p> \n<p>* Another purported target of Mueller's investigation is Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian oligarch with investments in Israel, for payments allegedly made to Michael Cohen. Vekselberg partnered with Israeli-Russian billionaires Len Blavatnik, who is invested in Israeli media, connected to Netanyahu and is also under Mueller’s spotlight, as well as Russian-Israeli billionaire Mikhail Fridman. One of their joint holdings was Alfa Bank, which, according to the Steele Dossier, owned a mysterious internet server found in Trump Tower. Fridman is also the main contributor to the Genesis Prize, in which Netanyahu regularly plays a prominent role, and which featured recently in the brouhaha surrounding Natalie Portman’s decision to decline the prize after she had earlier accepted it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A former senior Likud minister presented his committee’s proposals for a shake-up of the conversion system in Israel on Sunday, warning they were needed in order to avoid a “spiritual holocaust.”</p> \n<p>Moshe Nissim and his committee presented the recommendations to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But they have already been rejected by ultra-Orthodox lawmakers and the country’s chief rabbis, who vowed to “bury” them.</p> \n<p>The committee’s report recommends establishing a new state-run Orthodox authority – not under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate, which currently has a monopoly on conversions – in order to speed up the rate of conversions for hundreds of thousands of Israelis.</p> \n<p>The proposed legislation is the latest in a series of attempts in recent decades to reach a compromise on the thorny issue of conversion that would be acceptable to the majority of Jews around the world. Based on initial responses, however, it appears that, like its predecessors, this initiative is doomed to failure.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a press conference in Jerusalem, Nissim called the conversion issue nothing less than “the future existence of the Jewish people. This is the foundation stone of the Jewish people. The secret of the existence of the Jewish people is the ban on mixed marriage, which is a deadly drug for the Jewish people,” he said.</p> \n<p>Nissim said the goal of the new law is to stop the growing levels of assimilation in Israel.</p> \n<p>“There are some 400,000 people without a religion in Israel today,” he said, referring to immigrants who moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s and whose Judaism is not recognized by the Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>“Every year, fewer than 2,000 people convert [to Judaism in Israel], while some 10,000 people without a religion are added. Today, there is 10 percent assimilation in Israel – and if we do not act now, this figure will only increase. There is no other possibility but to describe it as no less than a spiritual holocaust,” he added.</p> \n<p>The present conversion system operates according to strictly Orthodox rules, but Nissim said more inclusive and lenient rules are needed to increase the number of converts.</p> \n<p>He said his committee has recommended only recognizing conversions according to traditional Jewish law (halakha). But conversions performed abroad by Reform and Conservative rabbis would be officially recognized.</p> \n<p>Although Jews who converted through the Reform or Conservative movements abroad are eligible to immigrate to Israel and receive Israeli citizenship, they are not recognized as Jewish by the Rabbinate. As a result, they cannot marry in the country.</p> \n<p>Nissim also spoke about the number of Orthodox rabbis who have withdrawn their support for the committee’s recommendations in recent days. He said they had not studied the committee report and was convinced that if they did so, they would support the recommendations.</p> \n<p>Nissim is a former deputy prime minister and finance and justice minister, and the son of former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Nissim.</p> \n<p>Despite his efforts, it seems the proposed amendments will run into fierce opposition from all denominations. The ultra-Orthodox in Israel have rejected Nissim’s plan because it strips the Rabbinate of its control over conversions in Israel. In more progressive Orthodox circles, the initiative has drawn fire because it would rule out any conversions performed by private rabbinical courts.</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery, also head of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, made clear he does not intend to promote the committee’s recommendations. “I unequivocally oppose these recommendations and will make sure they are not even brought up for discussion,” he said.</p> \n<p>“The only person authorized to submit a bill on the matter of conversion is the interior minister, according to government regulations, and it is clear I will not submit this proposal,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I demand an immediate return to the bill on the matter that I circulated and was approved by the cabinet – which is that, in principal, only official conversion by the Rabbinate will be recognized in Israel. I will raise this demand today in the meeting of [governing coalition] party leaders.”</p> \n<p>Earlier Sunday, Israel’s Ashkenazi and Sephardi chief rabbis, Rabbi David Lau and Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, convened an emergency meeting of ultra-Orthodox and religious Zionist rabbis, promising to do everything possible to scupper the committee’s recommendations.</p> \n<p>“I want to ask all the rabbis of Israel, from all circles, to be on guard,” Yosef said at the meeting. “This is recognition of conversions not according to halakha. It includes the recognition of Reform conversions; it has a very serious flaw. I am asking all the rabbis to sign and join the protest, and this law will be buried. This law is inappropriate,” he said.</p> \n<p>The rabbis signed a statement calling the proposed law “a danger to the unity of the Jewish people” because it remove control over conversion from the Rabbinate, and its recognition of conservative and Reform conversions.</p> \n<p>“We call on [Netanyahu] to reject the report of the Nissim committee out of hand and to immediately advance amendments to the law that will stop the attempts of the High Court of Justice to recognize private and Reform conversions,” stated the rabbis. “We ask all Knesset members and all ministers to do everything they can to prevent the conversion reforms that could case assimilation, disintegration and a split within the Jewish people – similar to what is happening, to our great regret, in many Reform and Conservative communities outside of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Leaders of the Reform and Conservative movements in Israel did not respond as negatively, but neither did they welcome the recommendations wholeheartedly. On the one hand, they noted that Nissim’s proposal would weaken the ultra-Orthodox-controlled Rabbinate – which as far as they are concerned, is a positive step. On the other hand, they noted that under Nissim’s proposal, non-Orthodox conversions performed in Israel would still not be recognized.</p> \n<p>“The recommendations have some worthy elements and some disturbing elements, and on the face of things it would seem that they deserve to be addressed,” said Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism: “But it is already clear that the ultra-Orthodox parties and the rabbinical establishment are determined to bury them deep in the ground.”</p> \n<p>Precisely for that reason, he said, “We cannot allow these people exclusive control over the gates of entrance to the Jewish people – which belong to the entire people, in Israel and abroad, and not to an extremist minority.”</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, described the recommendations as “quite revolutionary” in that they stripped the Rabbinate of its monopoly on conversions. He also welcomed Nissim’s proposal that representatives of the Conservative and Reform movements sit on the steering committee of the independent conversion authority that would be established.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said the decision to grant recognition by law to conversions performed outside of Israel by the Reform and Conservative movements (such recognition already exists today, albeit not by law) was a positive step.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“At the same time, or perhaps because of this, I don’t think these recommendations are politically viable,” Hess said. “The ultra-Orthodox oppose them for obvious reasons, but even for Diaspora Jews there is no real news here. Any legislation that perpetuates the Orthodox monopoly, even if it contains some concessions to liberals, means further humiliation to millions of non-Orthodox Jews. Have we not had enough of that over the past two years?”</p> \n<p>About two years ago, a group of modern Orthodox rabbis launched a private initiative known as “Giyur K’Halakha,” which has performed more than 600 conversions in the country (about 18 percent of the total each year). Within the Orthodox movement, these rabbis are known to be relatively liberal and their conversion requirements are considered less stringent. If passed, the legislation proposed by Nissim would outlaw this private initiative.</p> \n<p>Rabbi David Stav, a judge on the Giyur K’Halakha religious conversion court, responded to Nissim’s proposal negatively. “Political involvement in the world of halakha is a disaster for halakha and bad for the country. ... Politicians must not be allowed to determine what is conversion and what is halakha.”</p> \n<p>Uri Regev, the head of Hiddush – Freedom of Religion for Israel, said that when both ultra-Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews oppose something, then “the place for the proposal is the garbage can.</p> \n<p>“The choice of Moshe Nissim to head the committee to formulate the solution to the conversion battles, which have got worse over the past year, has made clear to us in Hiddush that this is the perpetuation of the Orthodox monopoly on conversion in Israel – and we were not disappointed,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But the encouraging news, which guarantees that this proposed law will not develop beyond the fetal stage, is that for the Haredim, recognition of liberal Orthodoxy is also an indecent act that must be uprooted,” added Regev. “We can only hope that the non-Orthodox movements around the world will make clear that adoption of the bill is a red line that will exacerbate the split between Israel and the Diaspora.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The burning hatred felt by so many for Donald Trump tends to make us forget that it’s not his personality but his policies that should interest us. And like hatred for Trump, love for Barack Obama tends to make us forget that he too had policies, not only a personality. If we compare the two we may be able to get some perspective on what’s taking place before our eyes.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Obama’s policy in the Middle East (but outside it as well) was based on the assumption that the United States’ traditional system of alliances sometimes drags it into unnecessary wars. He thought that such wars awaited America in the future, too, if it continued to support the moderate countries in our region that fear the rise of radical political Islam.</p> \n<p>Obama believed that political Islam wouldn’t disappear. If we pushed it into a corner with more and more inconclusive wars, it would only become more desperate and violent. That’s why the radicals should be in a system of agreements rather than ostracize: Iran first, but also the Turkey of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood. If they had a stake in the new order they’d have an interest in preserving it.</p> \n<p>That was supposed to be the way to tame them. Therefore Obama stretched out his hand to the extremists over the heads of the moderates, the traditional allies of the United States. This view assumed that our friends are already our friends, so now we have to know what's left to bring our enemies into the fold.</p> \n<p>In effect, this meant undermining the interests of Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel in order to placate Iran, Turkey, the party of then-Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, and once even Hamas (in a strange move in which Obama tried to sell us a Gaza cease-fire sponsored by Turkey and Qatar).</p> \n<p>But the hope of appeasing Islamic radicalism was a resounding failure. This policy gave radicals a de facto free hand to drown the Middle East in blood and destruction: the strengthening of Iran and its tentacles in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Gaza, and the abandoning of Syria to the Russians thus abetting a regime that fought its own citizens with gas, murdered about half a million of them and made millions of others refugees. At the same time, Erdogan became stronger at the expense of the Kurds, and neighborhood bullies the world over watched and understood that everything was permitted.</p> \n<p>Whoever succeeded Obama would have had to begin repairing the damage, because the world order had started to slide into chaos and from there would probably have proceeded to a race for nuclear weapons by secondary powers, which is frightening by any criterion.</p> \n<p>Trump turned energetically to the task of creating order. The slogan on the red hats – “Make America Great Again” – may have sounded hollow during the campaign, especially when it was accompanied by generous amounts of vulgar rhetoric. But as president that’s exactly what Trump set out to do: restore America’s super power standing.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to quantify this elusive quality, but prestige and credibility are essential for a world power if it seeks to preserve international order. For that purpose Trump produced a series of carrots and sticks, and it soon became clear to his rivals and friends that he planned to use them with gusto. The pundits continued to say that he’s capricious, but the enemies of the United States got the message.</p> \n<p>The summit in Singapore was an achievement that isn’t necessarily reflected in the document that was signed, but rather in the way it was achieved. In an atmosphere of blatant and credible threats (and apparently by pressuring China as well), Trump made clear that anyone who waves a missile at him will receive a reminder that Trump’s missile is bigger.</p> \n<p>Many people thought and still think that this is vulgar and lacks sophistication. But when we compare all this to Obama’s sophistication, it gives rise to some melancholy thoughts about how, with a little less sophistication, Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump style, may have avoided the low point international order to deteriorated to. Now all eyes are on Iran, and we can only hope that Trump will handle it with the same determination.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Be’eri, wheat field on fire. Teams from the Western Negev fire station are fighting a fire in a wheat field together with a team from the Jewish National Fund. A kite string has been found.” Not many ascribed much import to this laconic press release on a Saturday, April 14. Fires happen, certainly with summer approaching. And kites kids fly them. But that was just the first such announcement of many to come. This is the season of the burning kites.</p> \n<p>In recent months Gazans have sent hundreds of burning kites into Israel. Acres of yellowing fields have gone up in smoke. The people living on the Gaza border don’t hear “red alerts” any more, they see them and they’re angry and scared. So far no fence or obstacle presented by the army has stopped the flimsy airborne armada. Missile interception systems aren’t geared for such primitive “weaponry.”</p> \n<p>Israel and Hamas are on the verge of the first kite war | Analysis</p> \n<p>Absent solutions, more and more kites have taken to the air; if at first just a few fell into Israel, the sorties multiplied – and became more sophisticated. The first kites were a take on Molotov cocktails but later ones were equipped to explode, and kites were also joined by helium balloons.</p> \n<p>The first number that comes to mind is zero: That’s the number of Israeli casualties so far. If that number had been something else, the kites campaign might have become something else too. But there are other numbers that tell other parts of the story. Take for instance 463: as of Sunday, that was the number of fires suspected to have been caused by kites that were handled by the firefighting and rescue service, though the service admits that not all were investigated. They won’t elaborate in which cases the kite-fire link was proven. It bears adding that Yaakov Gabbay, deputy chief of the western Negev fire service, suspects that some of these were arson by other means, not kites.</p> \n<p>Whatever, it doesn’t matter to the next number, which is 25,000. That’s the number of dunams burned so far (in acres, 6,250), and it’s equivalent to the extent of the Carmel forest fire in 2010. But that’s where the similarity ends. There the fire burned forest while by Gaza, the main casualties are crops.</p> \n<p>Pictures of flaming forests may be more dramatic, but real damage has been caused by the kites, says Avner Yona, director of field crop operations at&nbsp;Kibbutz Nahal Oz. About 1,300 dunams of wheat and irrigation systems have gone up in flames. The big losses are mainly in the irrigation systems, he adds: Replacing irrigation systems takes time and turning the water back on takes two more days. Ultimately, instead of producing, say, seven tons of crop, they produce four.</p> \n<p>In a sense, the damage to Yona’s wheat fields is iconic: It’s the crop that has most suffered from the wave of fires in the south. Over 5,000 dunams of wheat have been lost, which may not be much out of the million dunams of wheat grown on a national scale. But the loss to the wheat farmers near Gaza is estimated by the tax authority at 7 million shekels (nearly $2 million) and counting.</p> \n<p>The state hastened to promise compensation and so far, 65 claims for kite-fire damage have been made – including to avocado and jojoba orchards, and equipment. Yona waxes skeptical however, claiming that so far the state has only paid a fraction of what it should. And there is a question of whether the state will recognize indirect damage, such as 180 dunams of watermelon fields that became infected by a virus, he notes. The army wouldn’t let the farmers spray from the air to protect the plants from spread of the disease as soon as it was noticed. Since the virus renders the fruit inedible, the farmers had to uproot the lot.</p> \n<p>Burned again and again</p> \n<p>The list of sites where fires broke out is long and varied. Beyond orchards and various crops, fire also consumed large swathes of the Kissufim Forest, the Be’eri Crater nature reserve, areas near the water reservoir of Kibbutz Nir Am and areas around the Besor Stream. These places were burned more than once, sometimes dozens of times.</p> \n<p>The damage isn’t just to the landscape. The residents in the area are breathing the smoke and suffering from it. This is particularly palpable among high-risk groups like children and asthmatics.</p> \n<p>“There has been an increase in asthma attacks in children,” says Dr. Nataly Shveydel, director of Clalit clinics at the kibbutzim Nir Am, Mefalsim, Erez and Or Haner. “In the last few weeks, many babies susceptible to asthma had attacks, and this is not the season when that usually happens. The day after the big fire at Miflasim, just when the children leave the schools, some came to me for treatment.” At this time of year, asthma sufferers are usually in a state of equilibrium and drug dosages tend to be low, but they’ve been using dosages more typical of flu season at the height of winter, Shveydel says.</p> \n<p>Some fire victims can’t be treated, because they’re not human: A lot of trees that suffered some burning were hewn down at Kissufim because of the risk they would fall. Whole nature reserves burned: The Parks and Nature Reserves Authority says 10,000 dunams of conservation ground has gone up, including 5,500 at Besor Stream (according to the latest estimate). Thousands of animals have died, notably small species, rodents, reptiles and insects. But not just them: Foxes, jackals, tortoises and lizards have died too and that’s just the start of the list.</p> \n<p>Israel’s nature reserves are relatively small, and the destroyed areas are a big part of them, Gilad Gabbay, manager of the southern district for the Parks and Nature Reserves Authority, told Haaretz. There has been a huge loss of habitats for animals in the region, he says; recovery will take years. “In the short term, it is almost impossible to compensate for the damage. In the long term, we will have to see what we can do to rehabilitate the reserves,” Gabay says. At the Besor, everywhere you look you see burned turtles, he says.</p> \n<p>Farmers and other residents in the area hang their hopes mainly on the army, which has been trying to find advanced technological solutions to fight the new, unexpected weapon. The present leading solution is to knock the kites and balloons out of the air using high-speed drones that collide with them. As of last week, about 600 incendiary kites and balloons had been intercepted this way. That number sounds impressive, but context is due, and was supplied by Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman last week. During a tour of the Gaza brigade, he said the army manages to knock down about two-thirds of the kites flown into Israel.</p> \n<p>That is perhaps a relative success but the army is far from containing the problem. Most of its difficulty lies in locating the kites and balloons in the air. Sometimes they’re so small they can barely be detected by the human eye, even aided by binoculars, and the Israeli army’s technological tools, however advanced, were not designed with this sort of thing in mind. In an effort to meet the challenge anyway, last week the army met with civilian aviation experts to brainstorm ideas.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, until either some magical or at least adequate solution is found, the army has stepped up its actions against the Palestinians launching the fiery kites: warning shots by planes towards groups setting up and flyihg kites and balloons. The IDF, as several of its officers have explained on a number of occasions, tends to avoid targeted hits on the launchers lest they cause heavy casualties.</p> \n<p>Nor do the residents of the south necessarily wish for an attack. “The state isn’t making any effort to improve life here,” says Ilanit Suissa, a resident of Kfar Gaza. “But it isn’t that I want a military campaign.” She compares the government to an ostrich “that sticks its head into the sand and progresses from one campaign to another and doesn’t do anything.” The problem needs to be solved from the root, says Suissa, and concludes: “Don’t start saying again that there’s nobody to talk to.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, has no doubt about the goal of the American “deal of the century.” “Its purpose is to bring down the Palestinian leadership and replace Mahmoud Abbas,” he told a newspaper over the weekend. Erekat is also certain that the Americans plan to bypass the UN refugee agency, the UNRWA, so that money earmarked for refugees goes directly to the countries hosting them. In this way, they would pull the rug out from under the refugee problem, one of the toughest issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>As a senior PA official told Haaretz, “the Palestinian Authority’s fear is what Palestinian officials call the Israeli, American, Saudi and Egyptian conspiracy, whose goal is to divide Gaza from the West Bank and provide an economic solution for Gaza while strengthening Hamas, thus avoiding diplomatic negotiations over the future of Palestine.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Kushner attacks Abbas, questions his ability to reach peace deal&nbsp;■&nbsp;Why Jordan is worried about Trump’s peace plan</p> \n<p>This fear is apparently justified. Based on reports in the Egyptian media that rely on Western diplomats, the American plan seeks to establish a free-trade zone between the Gaza Strip and El-Arish in Sinai where five large industrial projects will be established. In accordance with the Israeli demand, these projects will be established in Egypt, which will oversee operations and the passage of workers from Gaza to Sinai.</p> \n<p>Two-thirds of the workers will come from Gaza and one-third from Sinai. Later, a joint Egyptian-Palestinian port and solar-energy station will be built, and if everything goes as planned, an airport will be built. The government in Gaza will remain under Hamas’ control but be in full coordination with Egypt, which in recent months has been in intense talks with Hamas on control procedures at the border crossings.</p> \n<p>Egypt, which opened the Rafah crossing in mid-May in honor of Ramadan, will keep the crossings open for two more months until the Id al-Adha holiday, with the intention of leaving it open indefinitely. The crossing is now open not only for people but also for goods and construction materials, against Israel’s wishes. Thus Egypt is making clear to Israel that the closure policy on Gaza might collapse if Israel doesn’t agree to make things considerably easier for the Gazans.</p> \n<p>A bit of reconciliation</p> \n<p>This is also a clear message to the PA that if President Abbas continues to hinder reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, Gaza will be cut off from the West Bank and this will end the unification process for the two parts of Palestine.</p> \n<p>It seems that the Egyptian message has been heard, and according to a senior Fatah official in the West Bank, Yahya Rabah, the PA will begin paying the salaries to Gaza officials that it had suspended. Also, in coordination with Egypt, Fatah-Hamas reconciliation talks will resume with the goal of reviving the national-unity government in Gaza.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Egypt, which is particularly worried about developments in Gaza, doesn’t fully accept the U.S. initiative. On Thursday, after a meeting between Egyptian President Abel-Fattah al-Sissi, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, who’s in charge of the Palestinian issue, presidential spokesman Bassam Radi announced: “Egypt supports all efforts and initiatives to reach a comprehensive agreement, based on international resolutions made in the past and on the principle of two states for two peoples in the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.”</p> \n<p>This position makes clear that Egypt doesn’t support the Saudi idea of Abu Dis as the Palestinian capital, and that any economic plan for Gaza won’t be a substitute for a diplomatic plan accepted by the Palestinians. Thus Egypt divides the continuation of the process into two parts: assistance to Gaza and development of its economy as part of bolstering the border between it and Gaza, and comprehensive diplomatic negotiations independent of Gaza’s economy.</p> \n<p>Abdullah’s angst</p> \n<p>King Abdullah of Jordan, who also met with U.S. envoys Jared Kushner and Jason Greenblatt, is worried mainly about the Saudi intent to remove Jordan’s patronage at the holy places in Jerusalem, which it was promised in the Israel-Jordan peace agreement. Jordan is also worried about Israeli control over the Jordan Valley as part of a peace agreement. In the short term, Abdullah doesn’t oppose the separate economic development of Gaza, but he supports the traditional Arab position that Gaza and the West Bank not be separate entities.</p> \n<p>According to Arab sources, Saudi King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, seem to disagree over this issue. While Mohammed is an enthusiastic supporter of the American plan and the separation of Gaza from the West Bank, his father is concerned about the criticism he could expect if he relinquished the principles of the 2002 Saudi peace initiative by splitting the “Palestinian problem” into two parts and abandoning the position that East Jerusalem be the capital of Palestine.</p> \n<p>But it’s not only the “deal of the century” that’s a source of dispute among Arab leaders. President Donald Trump’s statement that he will ask Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to share in funding new projects in Gaza has encountered stiff opposition from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The two countries have made clear to U.S. envoys that Qatar’s involvement will mean Iran entering Gaza by the back door. They say they can handle the funding – an estimated $1 billion – on their own if Egypt and Israel agree.</p> \n<p>The UAE announced last year that it’s willing allocate $40 million for a power station, and that it would contribute some $15 million to fund the administration in Gaza.</p> \n<p>While the Arab-American dispute over the final resolution of the Palestine problem is playing into Israel’s hands, Israel will have to decide about Gaza. Focusing a solution in Gaza on economic projects supposedly plays into Israel’s hands in that it makes Gaza a humanitarian issue and not a diplomatic one. But political wrangling in Israel might torpedo this move in a way that puts Israel into a military confrontation with Gaza, while also pitting Israel against Washington.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – The final days of LGBT Pride Month is the perfect time for the Israeli film “The Cakemaker” to arrive in American theaters.</p> \n<p>A gentle, quiet drama, it tells the story of Thomas, a German baker who discovers that his lover – a closeted husband and father from Israel – has died in a car accident. Thomas then embarks on a journey to Jerusalem, where he becomes closely involved with his late lover’s family while keeping his true identity secret.</p> \n<p>It marks a directorial debut for Ofir Raul Graizer, 36, who has been living on the line between Israel and Germany for the past nine years.</p> \n<p>Graizer – who studied film but also trained in kitchens as a cook and will soon publish his own Middle Eastern cookbook – chose an intimate setting to explore love, family, religion and food, through which he can discuss a broader political reality.</p> \n<p>“I see the film as very attentive to its political background,” he tells Haaretz via phone from Berlin. “Through personal, small intimate stories, we can learn something about the political reality – be it the occupation, religion, the socioeconomic situation, and both the history and future of the country.”</p> \n<p>Graizer was inspired by the story of a friend whose wife discovered he was leading a double life only after he had passed away. It’s also a semi-autobiographical portrayal of growing up gay in Israel, with a religious father and secular mother.</p> \n<p>“The connection, or disconnection, between those ideas, worlds and value systems was always present in my life,” Graizer explains.</p> \n<p>Even though he had been open about his sexuality since he was 16, Graizer still found himself in different situations throughout life where he had to hide who he was.</p> \n<p>That also led him to explore the image of masculinity. “Israeli society is definitely a very macho, militant and patriarchal society, and it’s built in everything – in education, in the courtroom, the way that religion is part of the state,” the director notes, adding that such an approach is “not his thing.”</p> \n<p>Outsider’s point of view</p> \n<p>Graizer auditioned dozens of actors for the lead role before finding Tim Kalkhof. The 30-year-old German actor was immediately captivated by the script.</p> \n<p>“It was brilliantly written, very three-dimensional, without blacks and whites but many gray areas for us actors to explore and sink our teeth into,” he relates from Germany.</p> \n<p>According to Kalkhof, who has a girlfriend and a son, the most challenging part – more than a nude scene or the portrayal of a gay character – was getting slapped in the face by another character toward the end of the film, triggering Thomas’ emotional breakdown.</p> \n<p>“In those kinds of scenes you cannot act, there is no method, you have to go all the way,” he recounts. “It’s a thin line between acting and knowing I’m on camera but also not acting. You have to be in control and at the same time out of control,” he says, attempting to explain his captivating performance.</p> \n<p>Israeli-French actor Sarah Adler portrays Anat, the widow unwittingly sharing her grief with the German stranger who transforms her small local Jerusalem caf&eacute;, and life.</p> \n<p>Adler, who first came to prominence in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Notre Musique” in 2004, was already in Graizer’s mind when he wrote the script eight years ago. “There was something very convincing about Ofir’s desire and will, which is very strong and determined,” Adler tells Haaretz in a phone interview from Paris.</p> \n<p>Thomas is the obvious foreigner in the story, but Adler sees her character – a secular mother and independent caf&eacute; owner surrounded by religious family members – also as an outsider within her own community. “She is trying to be autonomous in a society that inflicts rules and ways of behavior, and she’s trying to break free,” she notes.</p> \n<p>Both actors see the film’s message as one of love that knows no bounds or judgment. Adler, who also starred in Samuel Maoz’s acclaimed Israeli drama “Foxtrot” last year, hopes people will come to realize that “the human connection is beyond gender and the definitions that are imposed by society.”</p> \n<p>Far from smooth</p> \n<p>Despite its micro-budget (less than $200,000), the film was released in Israel and played at festivals worldwide to rave reviews. Haaretz film critic Uri Klein called it “cinematically mature and wise,” while trade magazine Variety said it was “a tender, tactile and just-sweet-enough story.”</p> \n<p>But the film’s eight-year journey to the screen was far from smooth. “To finance a first film is always difficult,” Graizer explains. And people who read the script did not understand it, or thought it too melodramatic, he says. Graduating from Sapir College’s film school in Sderot, southern Israel, Graizer views himself as something of a marginal outsider, and not being part of the Israeli film clique did not help.</p> \n<p>Responding to some of the film’s critics, who felt it was not provocative or “gay” enough, Graizer says he had his fair share of “offensive or critical” short films in the past. “It’s a story about sensitivity, sadness, melancholy and love, so I don’t need to show what they expected me to show,” he says.</p> \n<p>Now, after being screened in 15 countries from France to South Korea, Graizer’s auspicious debut is set for an American adaptation, produced by Uri Singer’s Passage Pictures.</p> \n<p>Graizer himself is involved on the remake, rewriting different versions of the script while working on two other projects. “It’s kind of crazy to see so much belief and connection to the story,” he concludes. “It was very unexpected – especially after it took such a long time and nobody believed in it.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>There are no negotiations underway between Israel and Hamas, at least according to the Israeli government and Hamas leaders. But such talks have indeed been underway&nbsp;in recent days, with the involvement of the United Nations, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and a few European countries.</p> \n<p>The Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat reports that Hamas has been given three different proposals, each trying to tie a resolution of the crisis in the Gaza Strip to a cease-fire pledge, humanitarian assistance or return of the bodies of Israelis held by the organization there.</p> \n<p>Hamas, according to the report, is not satisfied by the options. It separates the return of the remains of the bodies – which it says should be done as part of a general prisoner swap without connection to resolving the crisis – and it rejects offers of humanitarian aid if they are not part of a broader plan to implement commitments to rehabilitate the Strip, as was decided after the Israel Defense Forces Operation Protective Edge in Gaza in 2014.</p> \n<p>The proposals in question are being filtered through Israel and Egypt before they reach Hamas, and as are the responses from the Islamist organization. If that’s not negotiating, what is?</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, an open monologue is underway between Iz al-Din al-Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, and the Israeli public. The platform is the Hebrew-language website www.qassam.ps/hebrew, on which Hamas describes its struggle, its victories and the worthlessness of the Zionist enemy. The Hebrew is rich and well phrased, grammatical mistakes are not ridiculous and the message is precise.</p> \n<p>For example, last week there was a cleverly rhyming Hebrew headline on a piece on the site about the underground tunnels dug by Hamas that have been destroyed by Israel, which mocks the Israel Defense Forces spokesman, “who apparently is not telling the truth, at least not with respect to one small but very significant detail: He forgets to mention that the tunnels being blown up are nothing but burned tunnels that have been out of use for four years.</p> \n<p>&quot;The occupation does everything to improve the morale of its public, among other things by inventing heroic stories that will be quickly shown, in any future clash, as having been made up.”</p> \n<p>Beyond the questions this statement raises about the truth of reports from the IDF Spokesman’s Office and which exact tunnels the army is blowing up – whether they are still “lively&quot; ones as Hamas puts it, which are not being demolished – the efforts Hamas is making to converse with the enemy are intriguing.</p> \n<p>Does Hamas believe that the Israeli public really wants to read about the organization’s declarations, its explanations and its main tenets? Does this effort stem from the thought that Hamas, and in particular the citizens of Gaza, are closely following Israeli statements and commentaries in the Hebrew media, and that’s why it assumes that the public in Israel wants to read about what Hamas thinks?</p> \n<p>If this is Hamas’ conclusion, perhaps they should save their breath. The Israeli public isn’t interested. Israelis make do with Hamas’ belligerent statements or violent messages. What the enemy thinks, even when it writes in clear and well-formulated Hebrew, doesn’t matter to Israelis.</p> \n<p>One of the headlines on the website, from May, reads: “Leah: Netanyahu doesn’t care about bringing Hadar back” – addressed to Leah Goldin, the mother of Lt. Hadar Goldin, who was killed in the fighting in Gaza in 2014. The statement quotes reports in Israel about Leah Goldin’s harsh criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his failure to repatriate her son’s remains.</p> \n<p>What is interesting about the headline is that the writer assumes that “Leah” and “Hadar” are such well-known names in Israel that there is no need to include the last name in the headline. As if the names were “Bibi and Sara.” The writer apparently also assumes that the debate over the return of the bodies of Hadar and others is so stormy in Israel that it is at the heart of the talks with Hamas, to the point where there is no need to explain to Israelis who “Leah” and “Hadar” are.</p> \n<p>Back to the article about the tunnels: In poetic Hebrew that requires a high-level knowledge of the language, using imagery that demands a familiarity with the history of the Vietnam War, the writer compares the outcome of that war and the trauma it has left on the American people, to Hamas’ struggle against Israel.</p> \n<p>“If a power that nourishes the Zionist entity through its umbilical cord was itself roundly defeated by the heroes of Vietnam through tunnels of death built for that purpose,&quot; the writer asks (in a rough translation), &quot;will justice treat in a favorable way the weak and defective fetus [in the form] of the foreign Jewish entity that has been planted in our sacred soil? It is doubtful</p> \n<p>&quot;The Palestinian bag of opposition is full of surprises, the least of which will leave the enemy shocked and open-mouthed here for a long time, and if the hand on the clock of the cease-fire meets a timetable [meaning if the cease-fire ends and military action begins – Z.B.], no one, but no one – from the head of the snake to its tail – will know any more happy times.”</p> \n<p>The content is unimportant, but the use of such a level of Hebrew leads to a number of conclusions. The writer gives great credit to the ability of the average Hebrew reader to appreciate a complex and colorful text in his language. Moreover, the writer wants to impress his readers with the depth of his understanding of Hebrew. Either possibility might actually make him lose his potential readers.</p> \n<p>One must hope that the indirect negotiations now going on between Hamas and Israel are in more comprehensible language. At the same time, we may ponder the importance and the degree of influence of propaganda being disseminated in the enemy’s own language – whether that of the IDF spokesman in Arabic, or of Hamas in Hebrew. On both sides, the mother tongue is considered a more reliable source than the other language, and both sides know very well how to translate it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>His parents and grandparents had emigrated to the United States from Guatemala. They'd been thrown in jail, incarcerated in detention centers, deported from his home, and experienced the political murder of his mother’s friend, who had spoken out for human rights in the 1980s, challenging the U.S.-backed dictator Gen. Efra&iacute;n R&iacute;os Montt, later convicted of genocide.</p> \n<p>He told me that Guatemalans have a saying: &quot;Nunca Otra Vez.&quot;</p> \n<p>The translation?</p> \n<p>&quot;Never Again.&quot;</p> \n<p>For decades, thousands of Latin Americans have attempted a dangerous journey to escape violence and poverty in their home countries in search of a better life in the United States.</p> \n<p>Many don’t know what their fate will be once they arrive at the border - whether they will be granted asylum, or turned away to their home countries.</p> \n<p>Most are terrified, and have no possible way of knowing that they may be thrown into a detention center when they arrive, while their children may be separated from them. If they lose this chance, their deportation could result in their death. That dire scenario applies to immigrants already living in the U.S. as well.</p> \n<p>Does this story sound familiar to you?</p> \n<p>Both before, during, and after WWII, there were thousands of Jews who were not granted asylum in the United States. The reasons then were fears about their potential threat to national security, and to demographic preferences and prejudice that led to quotas for Jews.</p> \n<p>If you’ve ever heard of the St. Louis, then you’ll know that in May of 1939, more than 900 Jewish refugees were refused entry into the United States. They were turned back to Europe where other countries, like Belgium and Great Britain, took them in. Nearly a third of the ship's passengers ended up in Nazi death camps. They could have been saved.</p> \n<p>The plight of Latin Americans bears many resemblances to the desperate refugee Jews of that time. And seeing the international community's lukewarm response then, as now, we have to ask ourselves, has anything really changed?</p> \n<p>In his recent lecture (&quot;No Place for the Displaced: The Jewish Refugee Crisis Before, During, and After WWII&quot;) at an international conference on the refugee crisis in Rome, Dr. Avinoam Patt, Professor of Modern Jewish History at the University of Hartford noted: &quot;Even after Kristallnacht, which would be widely reported in the international press, Americans remained reluctant to welcome Jewish refugees, and the restrictive immigration quotas remained in place.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the international community was prepared to reprimand Germany for its treatment of Jews, yet not one of these countries were keen to open their doors to refugees.</p> \n<p>Fast forward to 2018 and the United States is just as critical of the governments of many of the Latin American countries where migrants are coming from, yet they don’t want to help.</p> \n<p>This is even more appalling when the U.S. should, by all rights, shoulder blame for many of the atrocities happening in Latin America today. Whether it was the government playing a direct role in the start of Guatemala’s Civil War, the involvement of the CIA in destabilizing Chile in 1973, or the overwhelming evidence that suggests the U.S. trained death squads in El Salvador in the 1980s - these are just a few examples.</p> \n<p>It’s important to keep in mind that the United States isn’t the only country finding themselves with an influx of refugees. Countries all over Latin America, like Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, are dealing with their own issues of immigration, as more and more people flee Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras. The only difference is the immigration policies of these countries tend to be lighter, and don’t necessarily involve splitting up families.</p> \n<p>Those escaping horrific situations in Central America, or deathly regimes in Venezuela, aren’t waking up thinking, &quot;Which country should I try to go to?&quot; No matter where they choose, the process is long, difficult, and deadly, and most of the time, these people are already marginalized and scared.</p> \n<p>In the 1980s, when over 200,000 indigenous Mayans of Guatemala were killed or &quot;disappeared,&quot; those lucky enough to survive did so by being able to flee to neighboring countries. Today, those that we refuse to help face that same struggle to survive.</p> \n<p>Migrants fleeing El Salvador have described the constant violence, gang extortions, and threats they are escaping. Most have become displaced within El Salvador, having lived with different family members across the country before exhausting all options. In Venezuela, people are escaping hunger, the death of children by starvation, as the economic and political situation continues to spiral out of control.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If we don’t help, who will?</p> \n<p>As we know, for Latin American Jews, Israel has always been an option, but that’s not the case for non-Jews in Latin America. And, even if a legal way exists for these people to migrate, simply asking to leave their country can have fatal consequences.</p> \n<p>As American Jews, we're very familiar with the narratives of Jews who fled wartime Europe seeking sanctuary - and who often denied it by the United States itself. It's time we listened to - and taught - the narratives of desperate Latin American migrants and refugees as well.</p> \n<p>Hana LaRock is a freelance content writer and online English teacher originally from Long Island, New York.

        "text":["<p>When Carinne Sjoberg dissolved the Jewish Community of Umea in northern Sweden, she knew it would send shockwaves far beyond the small congregation that she had spent decades building.</p> \n<p>The move in May owed to intimidation by neo-Nazis, making it the first time in decades that a Jewish organization in Western Europe acknowledged that it felt compelled to close shop over safety concerns.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Swedish neo-Nazi Party Attends Biggest Political Event in Sweden&nbsp;■&nbsp;Syrian, Palestinian Asylum Seekers Jailed for Synagogue Firebombing in Sweden</p> \n<p>Neo-Nazis from the Nordic Resistance Movement, beginning in 2016, pasted stickers with fascist imagery on Umea’s Jewish community center, “making the place look like after Kristallnacht,” Sjoberg said. The closure followed surveillance activity on the center by the neo-Nazis, who published details about individual visitors.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t take it lightly,” Sjoberg, a 56-year-old Jewish mother of two, told JTA about the decision to close. “I hate giving neo-Nazis this victory. But I can’t bear the responsibility for people’s lives, not under such threats,” she said of her city’s Jewish community of 70 people.</p> \n<p>The closure caused a national uproar. Amid intense media coverage in Sweden of the affair, Prime Minister Stefan L&ouml;fven mentioned it in a speech denouncing anti-democracy forces in his country.</p> \n<p>But the indignation did little to change the fact that in Sweden, Muslim extremism and the far right are part of a broader set of challenges to Jewish communal life. So while the Jewish community of Stockholm may be growing, the problems are nonetheless causing some Swedish Jews to fear for their future as a minority here.</p> \n<p>“We have a vibrant community in Stockholm but even here we face multiple threats, from Muslim extremism to far-right violence,” said Aron Verstandig, president of the Council of Swedish Jewish Communities — an umbrella group with approximately 6,000 members out of Sweden’s estimated 20,000 Jews.</p> \n<p>None of these challenges are unique to Swedish Jewry: Several Jewish communities in Eastern Europe suffer neo-Nazi intimidation, and many Jews in the continent’s west have experienced violence at the hands of radical Muslims.</p> \n<p>Nor are the problems connected to living as a religious minority in an ultra-secular society like Sweden’s endemic to this country; they occur across Scandinavia and beyond.</p> \n<p>But Sweden is perhaps the only European country where Jews are reporting a critical convergence of these issues.&nbsp;For example, far-right violence is not a real concern for Jews in France, where more than a dozen of them have died since 2012 in anti-Semitic attacks by Muslims. Conversely, Muslim extremism is not a real issue to the Jews in Ukraine, where far-right nationalists have recently assaulted several congregants.</p> \n<p>Which is why to some Jewish community leaders in Europe, Swedish Jewry is something of a test case for the rest of the continent.</p> \n<p>“The challenges that the Jewish community in Sweden face today are sadly indicative of far wider phenomena taking place across Europe,” said Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress.</p> \n<p>In the southern province of Skane, a 15-year-old Jewish student attending a high school near&nbsp;Malmo&nbsp;suffers violent harassment at school both from ethnic Swedes and Muslim immigrants, his father said.</p> \n<p>‘The leader of one gang is an Afghan boy,” the father, an Israeli who moved to Sweden eight years ago for work, told JTA on condition of anonymity. One beating happened last year after his son refused to play in a soccer match with one team called “the Jews” and another “the Palestinians.”</p> \n<p>Another beating involved an ethnic Swede who picked on the Jewish boy, the father said.</p> \n<p>His son boy “goes to school reluctantly. He doesn’t want to live here. He wants to move back to Israel as as soon as he turns 18, join the army and fight the Arabs. He’s become very right wing,” the father said.</p> \n<p>Stefan Dozzi, the secretary-general of the Sweden-Israel Friendship Association, also has firsthand experience of the dual threat facing Swedish Jewry.</p> \n<p>During the Almedalen political activism conference last week on the island of Gotland, south of Stockholm, he and another activist for the organization were physically&nbsp;assaulted&nbsp;by neo-Nazis who attempted to place their banner on the association’s flag in the group’s pavilion. It was the first time the pro-Israel group set up a pavilion during the Almedalen conference.</p> \n<p>The incident was widely reported in Swedish media. However, Dozzi said, “no one wrote about the intimidation by Muslims” at Almedalen. At least two men he described as Muslims told him they would burn the Israeli flag on display at the association’s pavilion. Dozzi said the flag was stolen during a break later that day.</p> \n<p>“We have two kinds of enemies,” said Dozzi, who described himself as having Jewish roots. “I think things will only get worse here, with the Muslims and the neo-Nazis. We will have to flee this country eventually.” Dozzi, who works for the association full time, said he feels “safer in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Back in Umea, Sjoberg said she has faced various forms of anti-Semitism, ranging from the neo-Nazi harassment to “Arabs who spat at me on the street for wearing a Star of David pendant.”</p> \n<p>Such incidents involving Muslims are on the mild end of the spectrum.</p> \n<p>Last month, three Arab men were convicted of hurling firebombs at the synagogue of Gothenburg in southern Sweden in December after President Donald Trump announced the U.S. Embassy in Israel would be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>It was one of several attacks on Jewish places in worship in southern Sweden in recent years, and especially in Malmo, where a third of this city’s population of 350,000 is Muslim and about 1,000 residents are Jewish.</p> \n<p>Jihadism and neo-Nazi anti-Semitism “feed off one another” in Sweden, Sjoberg said.</p> \n<p>The arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muslims to Sweden starting in the 1970s generated “less tolerance to people who are perceived as foreign,” emboldening the far right.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think they would have dared to go after us like this 15 years ago,” Sjoberg said.</p> \n<p>The boldness of neo-Nazis in Sweden seems unusual for Western Europe, where law enforcement agencies in many countries with bitter memories of Nazism have a relatively low tolerance for far-right shenanigans.</p> \n<p>In 2015 and 2017, skinheads twice disrupted lectures in Swedish schools by Holocaust survivors. And in Gothenburg last year, hundreds of neo-Nazis&nbsp;marched on Yom Kippur to celebrate their hateful ideology. The original itinerary had them passing by the synagogue, but city authorities made them avoid it.</p> \n<p>Part of the problem, Sjoberg said, is that Sweden was never de-Nazified after World War II — it was officially neutral but in practice collaborated with Nazi Germany.</p> \n<p>“There was massive support for the Nazis, but none of the reckoning against collaborators that happened in occupied countries after liberation,” she said, referencing the dismissal of collaborators from positions of influence and prosecutions in France, Italy, the Netherlands and beyond.</p> \n<p>In Umea, authorities lack the determination to stand up for the Jewish community, Sjoberg said. Talks with the city on moving the Jewish center to a secure location ended abruptly last year, she said, when authorities put the intended space up for rent and backed out of an agreement to turn it into a JCC.</p> \n<p>“They were giving us the run-around, not keeping to agreements and leaving us twisting in the wind when we were being targeted by neo-Nazis keeping track of our comings and goings. I had to pull the plug,” Sjoberg said.</p> \n<p>Umea’s deputy mayor, Margareta R&ouml;nngren, disputed her account of negotiations.</p> \n<p>“The members decided to close down the community, the municipality cannot take responsibility for that,” R&ouml;nngren told JTA. “Accommodation was an urgent issue, the municipality tried to help the community, but could not at this time find a safe solution that met the community’s requirements.”</p> \n<p>The city “in fact offered the Jewish community center other accommodation, safety premises were checked by our security department, but the community didn’t approve,” she said. “The closure of the Umea Jewish community center is very sad” and “very serious when the causes are threats and harassment.”</p> \n<p>In addition to violent harassment, Swedish Jews also need to deal with strict secularism on the part of authorities that sometimes encroaches on their customs.</p> \n<p>Ritual slaughter of animals is illegal in Sweden, and although ritual circumcision of boys under 18 is allowed, banning the practice is a constant subject for debate. A Jewish couple in Gothenburg, a Chabad rabbi and his wife, are facing hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for insisting on homeschooling their children. And in March, two Cabinet ministers&nbsp;called&nbsp;for shuttering all faith schools.</p> \n<p>Yet even against this backdrop, Jewish life has prevailed, at least in Stockholm, according to Petra Kahn Nord, the community’s spokeswoman. The capital, she said, has three synagogues, a JCC with a kosher shop and a newly opened Jewish library.</p> \n<p>Stockholm also has a Jewish kindergarten and a Jewish school “with a long waiting list,” Kahn Nord said, adding that the community in the city is growing with a lively participation of young congregants and&nbsp;at least one Limmud Jewish learning conference annually.</p> \n<p>But this success feeds of other communities, like Malmo, where there are so few Jews left that the Jewish kindergarten there now has mostly non-Jewish children, Kahn Nord acknowledged. She said some Jews from her hometown of Malmo, Gothenburg and beyond leave for Stockholm because of harassment.</p> \n<p>But many do so “for positive reasons — because they want to have a more Jewish life,” Kahn Nord said. So while “Stockholm’s Jewish community is growing,” in the rest of Sweden “it’s just dying away.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Following an interview with Ari Shavit published in Haaretz last week, in which he referred to various women accusing him of sexual harassment and his subsequent soul-searching, another woman came forward to accuse the journalist of untoward behavior.</p> \n<p>The woman's account, published by the independent Israeli online magazine &quot;Hottest Place in Hell,&quot; details a claim according to which Shavit placed his hand on the back of the complainant's neck and tried to move her head for a kiss while she was dating his daughter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt; Ari Shavit, go away and don't come back | Opinion</p> \n<p>&quot;When my ex-partner’s father gripped the back of my neck he was a 50-year-old man, husband and father, a highly-respected and well-positioned journalist, a regular at a gym, and at trendy wine bars, surrounded by beautiful women,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I could feel all of these weighing on the back of my neck. I felt we both knew he was convinced that he is deserving.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I reminded him that I am of his own daughter’s partner,&quot; she wrote, adding that he responded,&quot;That is not what I understood. You’re her ex. I wouldn’t hit on the partner of a friend of mine, especially if I knew they were still together.'”</p> \n<p>Following the publication of the latest account, Shavit told Army Radio that the author &quot;murdered my daughter this morning. She ruined her life. What was done to me is cold-blooded murder. A despicable act, people are being slaughtered in the street with no debate [taking place] or anything. [Even] in the Soviet Revolution there were no field trials. We cannot allow this to go on.&quot;</p> \n<p>The essay the complainant penned is addressed as an open letter to Dr. Orit Kamir, a lawyer and a legal scholar who drafter the Israeli law against sexual harassment and interviewed Shavit for Haaretz.</p> \n<p>The author noted she published her story, with details slightly changed and published anonymously, in July 2013. &quot;My partner was Ari Shavit’s daughter, who is presently, as quoted in your own article, 'a human rights activist and an avid feminist.' Unlike the blatant formulation published on Haaretz online – the first time his daughter confronted his shady actions was not a year-and-a-half ago but six years ago.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;For six years she and I have been coping with that painful night, together and separately, sensitively, bravely, through dialogue,&quot; she wrote. &quot;From where I stand I can attest that she has definitely been making progress in this journey, being one of the wisest and most moral women I know. And thus I know that she realizes why I must make this letter public.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to the report, Shavit responded to the new allegations:&nbsp;&quot;My daughter's ex-partner thinks I should disappear forever. Her position is radical and disproportionate. When I made mistakes regarding young women I took full responsibility. I apologized, I suspended myself, I learned lessons. I went and am still going through a process of mending, but the story told here is completely different. There's nothing between what took place and what is described here. The version changes and evolves. I did not grab her by the neck, I did not try to kiss her, I had no unworthy intentions with regards to her. As it involves my daughter's private life I will not elaborate any further.&quot;</p> \n<p>In October 2016 Shavit announced his resignation from Haaretz and Channel 10, after Jewish-American journalist Danielle Berrin accused him of trying to forcefully kiss and touch her during an interview.</p> \n<p>&quot;I am ashamed of the mistakes I made with regards to people in general and women in particular,&quot; Shavit said in a statement following his resignation. &quot;I am embarrassed that I did not behave correctly to my wife and children. I am embarrassed about the consequences of what I did.&quot;</p> \n<p>Shavit told Haaretz in last week's interview that &quot;besides Danielle Berrin, the woman who opened my eyes is my eldest daughter. She is an impassioned feminist and human-rights activist. She is also one of the wisest, most moral women I know. On a bleak Shabbat, as everything around me seemed to collapse, we took a long walk together in a public park near our home. I was in shock. My world was ablaze. Yet, then and there, my daughter helped me begin my conversion.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;With great love and empathy, she illuminated for me what I had only begun to see. She told me how young women of the third millennium perceive my actions. She asked me how I would feel if she found herself in a situation similar to the one Danielle Berrin found herself in. Her plainspoken insights, together with what Berrin had written, shook me to my core. When we returned home, I began to see the world differently,&quot; Shavit said.</p> \n<p>Following Berrin's accusation, a J Street staffer said Shavit 'groped' her hand and tried to call her afterward several times.</p> \n<p>In December 2017, the Jewish Currents magazine detailed two further allegations against Shavit that took place in 2014 and 2015. The first reported that Shavit approached her during an event at the University of Maryland to promote his book &quot;My Promised Land.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;At the end of the conversation, we stood up, and while shaking hands, he leaned towards my face,&quot; said Farooqi, who was 22 at the time. &quot;I turned my head, and he was kissing the side of my mouth. I said nothing. I felt weird. I didn’t feel assaulted, I just kept thinking, ‘that was weird.’”</p> \n<p>The second allegation reported in the magazine refers to an incident that took place in January 2014 at Brandeis. The woman, Catriona Stewart, was 20 at the time and served as a J Street U student leader. According to Stewart, Shavit approached a group of students to in order to take a photograph. “I was excited to take a picture with him,&quot; she said. &quot;He had signed my book, and as I stood next to him for the picture he started to move his hand, rubbing me along my lower back it was touchier than I’d ever experienced from an adult I didn’t know.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

But it does mean that other partners are becoming more important than they were before.&quot;&quot; [Politico]&nbsp;  Russia stays in the driver’s seat in Syria -- by&nbsp;Ishaan Tharoor: &quot;The question of what happens next in Syria will loom over Putin’s planned meeting with Trump next week in Helsinki.&nbsp;Trump administration officials have long sought to&nbsp;drive a wedge between Assad’s two main backers, Russia and Iran. The latter’s entrenched position in Syria is reviled by both Washington and Israel. But while there’s plenty that separates Moscow and Tehran, a split between the two is not in the cards. “The Russians can’t guarantee an absence of Iran in Syria,” explained Maxim Suchkov,&nbsp;a Moscow-based expert on Russian foreign policy in the Middle East.&quot;  &quot;And ultimately, argued Suchkov, Putin values his ability to “create the image” of a successful actor in the Middle East, especially in contrast to the United States.&nbsp;“For the United States, Syria is more about Iran,” he said. “For Russia, Syria is about the United States.”&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;  Can Russia deliver on Trump’s hope of ousting Iran from Syria? -- by&nbsp;Kirill Semenov:&nbsp;&quot;One reason why Damascus might be open to turning away from the pro-Iran vector is the return of US sanctions on Iran. There’s a view in Moscow that Syrian leaders are sensibly worried that excessive dependency on Tehran is likely to drag Syria down as well.&quot; [Al-Monitor]&nbsp;  Michael Sharnoff writes “Russia and the U.S. have common interests in Syria. But it may not matter:&nbsp;Russia and the United States want to prevent another Israeli-Hezbollah war, which could cause greater regional instability. Securing a buffer zone with clear and narrowly defined objectives that prevent the Iranians from establishing a base in southern Syria satisfies U.S. and Russian interests.” [WashPost]&nbsp;  HEARD THIS MORNING -- Trump in a gaggle with reporters outside the White House:&nbsp;&quot;So I have NATO, I have the UK, which is in somewhat turmoil, and I have Putin.&nbsp;Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of them all.&nbsp;Who would think? ...&nbsp;I think that getting along with Russia, getting along with China, getting along with others is a good thing, not a bad thing.&nbsp;I've said that many times for many years.&nbsp;So we'll see.&quot; [Video]  HAPPENING TOMORROW:&nbsp;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will&nbsp;travel to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two leaders are expected to discuss &quot;pressing cooperation issues and problems on the global agenda, including ways to resolve the Israel-Palestine issue and the Syrian conflict,&quot; according to the Kremlin.&nbsp;  REPORT --&nbsp;Israeli, Saudi, and Emirati Officials Privately Pushed for Trump to Strike a “Grand Bargain” with Putin -- by&nbsp;Adam Entous:&nbsp;“Israeli officials lobbied for rapprochement between Washington and Moscow soon after Trump’s election victory. In a private meeting during the transition, an attendee told me, Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States and one of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest confidants, said that the Israeli government was encouraging the incoming Trump Administration to co&ouml;perate more closely with Putin, starting in Syria, with the hope of convincing Moscow to push the Iranians to leave the country, the attendee said. Like M.B.Z., Netanyahu made courting Putin a priority, particularly after Russia’s military intervention in Syria in 2015.”  “Separately, a former U.S. official recalled having a conversation after Trump’s Inauguration with an Israeli Cabinet minister with close ties to Netanyahu in which the minister pitched the American on the idea of “trading Ukraine for Syria.” The former official told me, “You can understand why Russia’s help with Syria is a far higher priority for Israel than pushing back on Russian aggression in Ukraine. But I considered it a major stretch for Israel to try to convince the United States that U.S. interests are well served by looking the other way at Russian aggression in Ukraine. Of course, Trump may disagree for his own reasons.””&nbsp;[NewYorker]  Tal Shalev tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Funfact: BB's support tweet for Donald Trump's border wall was his most retweeted tweet ever, according to the annual @Twiplomacy report.&quot;&nbsp;  Israel 'not ruling out' eventual ties with Syria's Assad -- by Dan Williams:&nbsp;&quot;Touring the Israeli-occupied Golan, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman ramped up threats to use armed force should Damascus encroach militarily. “Any Syrian soldier who will be in the buffer zone risks his life,” Lieberman told reporters... Asked by a reporter... whether the two old enemies could establish “some kind of relationship”, Lieberman said: “I reckon we are a long way from that, but we are not ruling out anything.”&quot; [Reuters]&nbsp;  TALK OF THE REGION --&nbsp;Unable to Stop Flaming Kites, Israel Moves to Choke Off Gaza Commerce -- by&nbsp;David Halbfinger:&nbsp;&quot;The new restrictions at Gaza’s main cargo crossing ban the import of all goods except food, medicine and “humanitarian equipment,” as well as all exports...&nbsp;Short of military action, analysts said, Israel has few options, since its blockade already severely restricts the movement of people in and out of Gaza. “The only measure that Israel has in its tool kit is to close the border,” said Celine Touboul, deputy director general of Israel’s Economic Cooperation Foundation.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The new restrictions at Kerem Shalom could quickly be subsumed into a larger diplomatic struggle involving Israel, Egypt, the United States and the Palestinian Authority over how to ease suffering in Gaza, and who should bear responsibility for it.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Israel says that monitoring social media has cut ‘lone wolf’ attacks. Palestinians are crying foul -- by&nbsp;Ruth Eglash:&nbsp;&quot;Amid a wave of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks that began nearly three years ago, Israel has stepped up its monitoring of social media...&nbsp;Security forces and intelligence agencies are also using computer algorithms to predict the likelihood that a given person will carry&nbsp;out a lone-wolf attack and to intervene before it happens.&nbsp;Israel says its methods are working, pointing to a sharp drop in attacks carried out largely by young, disaffected Palestinians.&nbsp;But those methods have generated&nbsp;serious questions about&nbsp;an erosion of privacy, freedom of speech and human rights...&nbsp;For many Palestinians, the knowledge&nbsp;that Israeli authorities are tracking their social-media activities is seen as just another level of oppression and restriction&nbsp;in an in&shy;trac&shy;table, decades-old&nbsp;conflict.&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;  TALK AT TURTLE BAY -- UN agency for Palestinians warns of deep cuts if funding shortfall not fixed:&nbsp;&quot;The UN agency for Palestinian refugees and their descendants has warned that cuts to key programs in the Gaza Strip and West Bank are planned over the coming weeks, if a US funding freeze cannot be overcome. Figures were not yet available on the cuts being planned if the major gap in financing is not resolved, but a letter sent to agency staff over the weekend, and seen by AFP on Monday, highlights the targeted areas... Most of the cuts were expected in the West Bank. Some programs were due to run out of funds by the end of July, according to the source.&quot; [ToI]&nbsp;  ACROSS THE POND --&nbsp;What&nbsp;does Boris Johnson's resignation mean&nbsp;for&nbsp;UK-Israel relations? -- by Eytan Halon:&nbsp;&quot;Former British foreign minister Boris Johnson's&nbsp;resignation&nbsp;on Monday plunged Prime Minister Theresa May's turbulent Brexit Britain government into even more trouble...&nbsp;Under Johnson's ministerial tenure, UK-Israel ties have prospered with bilateral trade between the countries reaching &pound;6.9bn ($9.1bn) in 2017... Johnson did not shy away from making clear his strong support for Israel while foreign minister... expressing his pride in &quot;Britain's part in creating Israel&quot; in a&nbsp;Daily Telegraph&nbsp;op-ed... The former London mayor was also a passionate believer in the urgency of reaching a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,&nbsp;telling&nbsp;The Jerusalem Post&nbsp;in March 2017 that &quot;you have to have a two-state solution or else you have a kind of apartheid system.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Israeli Ambassador to the UK Mark Regev soon welcomed Johnson's foreign secretary replacement, expressing hope that relations between the two countries will continue to go from strength to strength. &quot;Mazal tov to Jeremy Hunt on his appointment as Foreign Secretary. Looking forward to further strengthening the Israel-UK partnership,&quot; wrote the Israeli envoy on Twitter...&nbsp;Although public statements made by Hunt to date regarding Israel are scarce, he dedicates much of his website's foreign policy section to the Middle East where his opinions regarding the Israeli-Arab conflict mirror those of the Conservative Party in general.&quot; [JPost]&nbsp;  SUPREME COURT WATCH -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tells CBS This Morning&nbsp;that he will work to oppose Judge Brett&nbsp;Kavanaugh's nomination&nbsp;to the Supreme Court with &quot;everything I've got.&quot; Adding,&nbsp;“At a time when we have the Mueller investigation, Judge Kavanaugh is way at the extremes. He believes a president shouldn’t even be investigated. He has gone so far as to say a president who believes the law’s unconstitutional, doesn’t have to follow it.&quot; [Video]&nbsp;  Former Senator Norm Coleman tweets:&nbsp;&quot;I had the honor as a U.S.Senator to meet with, review their records&amp;vote to confirm the nominations of Justices Roberts &amp; Alito to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh possesses the requisite intellect &amp; integrity that should easily ensure his confirmation. Time to put politics aside.&quot;&nbsp;  The Anti-Defamation League in a&nbsp;statement:&nbsp;&quot;We are concerned that&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;Kavanaugh’s judicial record does not reflect the demonstrated&nbsp;independence and&nbsp;commitment to fair treatment for all that is necessary to merit a seat on our nation’s highest court.&nbsp;Because&nbsp;he&nbsp;has written and spoken prolifically on&nbsp;many&nbsp;issues of deep concern, we believe&nbsp;his&nbsp;positions merit close scrutiny. &nbsp;These include&nbsp;his&nbsp;demonstrated&nbsp;hostility to&nbsp;reproductive freedom and&nbsp;his past support for greatly expanded and unchecked executive power.&quot;&nbsp;  Norm Eisen emails us&nbsp;“Kavanaugh’s views are troubling on a woman’s right to choose, on all our rights to healthcare and on government protection of consumers. But he has a conflict that no prior Supreme Court nominee has faced: nomination by a president who has been identified as a subject in a criminal investigation that is advanced and has brought down or focused on top aides. At a minimum, the nominee must answer questions about that, including about his own extreme views that a president should not even be questioned while in office. If he refuses to answer the questions he should recuse — and if he refuses to do that, his nomination should be delayed until the criminal investigations have concluded. If not, a cloud will hang over his appointment.”  -- American Constitution Society’s Caroline Fredrickson and Norm Eisen write “Will Kavanaugh Provide Cover for Trump?&nbsp;This issue is particularly important given repeated claims by the president’s attorneys that Mr. Trump is essentially above the law — that he can even refuse a subpoena to testify. Given the looming Mueller investigation, these weighty, knotty constitutional questions may soon come before the court.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Fun fact via C-SPAN's Howard Mortman:&nbsp;At Kavanaugh's&nbsp;hearing for Circuit Court on May 9, 2006, he was introduced to the Senate Judiciary Committee&nbsp;by Alex Kozinski, a&nbsp;son of Holocaust survivors. [Video]&nbsp;  TALK OF THE TOWN --&nbsp;Stephen Miller trashed pricey sushi after bartender gave him the finger -- by&nbsp;Tamar Lapin:&nbsp;&quot;White House senior adviser Stephen Miller was so outraged when a bartender gave him both middle fingers that he dumped $80 worth of sushi in the trash... Miller, 32, was picking up a takeout order from a restaurant near his City Center apartment in Washington, DC, when the barman followed him out into the street and shouted, “Stephen!” before making the rude gesture and cursing him out... In another encounter, a stranger shouted “Better be better!” at Miller as he walked through Dupont Circle a few months ago.&quot; [NYPost]  Former Trump&nbsp;administration official&nbsp;Boris Epshteyn&nbsp;on his&nbsp;job as chief political analyst for Sinclair Broadcast Group in an interview with Hamodia: &quot;The American people are absolutely tired of Trump-bashing. My segment goes out to millions of people around the country. I get a lot of the emails from folks all over the country (maybe not in the D.C. bubble or New York) who are saying that Trump is doing great... But if you read some newspapers here in New York, they’ll go on for 15 paragraphs about some in-house drama that may or may not actually be happening in the White House.&quot;&nbsp;  Epshteyn on&nbsp;Trump’s 2017 Holocaust Remembrance Day statement:&nbsp;&quot;I had a role in writing the statement. Obviously, I am 100 percent Jewish and had family that perished in the Holocaust. As I helped draft the statement I looked at prior statements. There was one in 2008, when President Bush did not mention the Jewish people. The meaning of the statement was to include all of those who perished in the Holocaust. Of course, that includes the Jewish people. Since it was only a couple days into the presidency, I think that attack was a preview of the absolute hatred for the president and anyone who worked for him. It was completely unfair. Would I have included the term “Jewish people” if I knew that anyone would have been offended? Of course.&quot; [Hamodia]&nbsp;&nbsp;  2018 WATCH -- NRCC Pulls Support For House Candidate With Racist History -- by Haley Byrd:&nbsp;“The National Republican Campaign Committee has pulled its support from Seth Grossman, the GOP nominee in New Jersey's 2nd Congressional District, after MediaMatters.org revealed social media posts by Grossman containing white supremacist content. “Bigotry has no place in society—let alone the U.S. House of Representatives.

While most of the studio heads complied with the ban... the Warner brothers did their best to fight back...

The spice gives a deep rich color and imparts a delicious smoky flavor.</p> \n<p>This is my updated and modernized variation of mom’s simple recipe made into an easy one-pan meal. Oh, and find yourself some Castelvetrano olives – they are buttery with a bit of brine and so addictive.</p> \n<p>Tip: If you can’t find the specified olives, substitute with the easier-to-find green manzanilla olives.</p> \n<p>This recipe is excerpted from my new cookbook, “The Weeknight Mediterranean Kitchen.”</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>2 pounds chicken thighs, bone-in and skin-on</p> \n<p>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</p> \n<p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p> \n<p>Olive oil, as needed</p> \n<p>1 shallot, chopped finely</p> \n<p>2 garlic cloves, chopped finely</p> \n<p>8 ounces dried orzo</p> \n<p>2 cups chicken stock</p> \n<p>1 lemon, sliced</p> \n<p>1 cup whole pitted Castelvetrano olives</p> \n<p>Chopped parsley, for garnish</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Directions:</p> \n<p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.</p> \n<p>2. In a bowl, toss the chicken with the paprika and salt, making sure the spices evenly coat the chicken.</p> \n<p>3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add enough olive oil to coat the bottom. Don’t add too much oil because the chicken will give off its own fat as well.</p> \n<p>4. Once the oil is hot, place the chicken thighs skin-side down into the hot pan and cook until a deep golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes, then flip the chicken over to the other side and cook for an additional 3 minutes.</p> \n<p>5. Once both sides of the chicken are a deep golden brown, remove to a plate and set aside.</p> \n<p>6. In the same hot skillet, add the shallot and saute until lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for another minute.</p> \n<p>7. Add the orzo and stir so it is coated in the oil and aromatics (this will give it great flavor). Use a spatula to even out the orzo. Add the chicken back into the pan, skin-side up and pour in the stock.</p> \n<p>8. Scatter the lemon slices and olives over the chicken and orzo and place in the oven, covered, for 25 minutes. Remove the cover and continue cooking for an additional 12 to 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>9. Once cooked, remove from the oven and garnish with parsley. Serves 2-4.</p> \n<p>Samantha Ferraro is the food blogger and photographer for The Little Ferraro Kitchen. Follow Samantha at http://littleferrarokitchen.com</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s been eight months since dozens of accusations of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein kicked off the #MeToo movement. As the dust begins to settle some men are coming forward, making clear that they feel it is just about time they were forgiven.</p> \n<p>Mario Batali, the chef who was&nbsp;accused&nbsp;of numerous counts of sexual misconduct and assault,&nbsp;is reportedly considering staging his redemption&nbsp;by “creating a new company led by a powerful woman chief executive.” Comedian Louis CK, who&nbsp;admitted&nbsp;to cornering female comedians and masturbating in front of them, is thought to be&nbsp;planning a return&nbsp;via small comedy clubs.</p> \n<p>A third&nbsp;appeared in Haaretz this week, in a 3,861-word interview: disgraced journalist and public speaker Ari Shavit.</p> \n<p>Shavit’s crimes preceded the #MeToo movement by a few years. He was the subject of&nbsp;an article&nbsp;by Jewish journalist Danielle Berrin describing a sexual assault in 2016, when she alleged that a prominent journalist grabbed her and tried to kiss her and proposition her for sex during an interview.</p> \n<p>Shavit&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;that he was the unnamed writer in Berrin’s piece and claimed not to have assaulted her, saying that he viewed the interaction as “flirtation” and apologized deeply for the “misunderstanding.”</p> \n<p>When a second, unnamed woman&nbsp;came forward&nbsp;with another harassment accusation,&nbsp;Shavit resigned&nbsp;from his position at Haaretz and Israel’s Channel 10 news. But determined to return to the public eye, Shavit resurfaced in December 2017; he had been invited to host a talk at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan. The talk was cancelled when two more young women&nbsp;came forward&nbsp;and said that Shavit had made inappropriate sexual advances on them.</p> \n<p>Now, in an interview with Israeli intellectual Orit Kamir titled “Ari Shavit: I Was Blind to the Power I Had as a Privileged White Man,” Shavit is attempting to re-gain the public’s trust and return to his plum position as a thinker, writer, and lecturer.</p> \n<p>“I made a terrible mistake,” Shavit tells Kamir. “I was inattentive, and I completely misread the situation.”</p> \n<p>He describes the teshuvah he has done — speaking with his wife, his daughter, and even Berrin herself. He’s changed, he says. He was a “late bloomer.” He tried to “climb too many mountains.” But at the end of the day he is a “humanist” and has “faith in the human spirit.”</p> \n<p>He’s a proud feminist, he insists. His ability to speak about his mistakes and many trials shows that “there is light at the end of the tunnel.” Ari Shavit, apparently, is that light.</p> \n<p>The entire interview might as well be made out of avocado for the way it seems designed to appeal to the #MeToo generation. But a closer reading in light of the events that led up to it shows Shavit’s duplicity. Even as he announces, “I am not forgoing my narrative” he forgoes mentioning that three other women have come forward accusing him of sexual assault or harassment. Even as he professes having done ample teshuva, including reaching out to Berrin, he fails to mention&nbsp;the op-ed she published&nbsp;in the Times in December 2017 stating that she does not forgive him.</p> \n<p>“Men like Mr. Shavit would do well to remember that a true apology would not make excuses or justify bad behavior,” she writes, “but would take full responsibility for what went wrong.”</p> \n<p>Erasing Berrin’s own words is par for the course in a piece that fails to own up to Shavit’s actual crime. Specifically, he has not apologized for what he has been accused of by Berrin: sexual assault.</p> \n<p>In every grease-dripping comment of his in Haaretz, Shavit claims atonement while simultaneously undermining Berrin’s story about why he should atone in the first place.</p> \n<p>“How could this have happened?” he ponders of his interaction with Berrin. “How is it possible that a woman was intimidated in my presence?” he asks, as if Berrin accused him of intimidating her, rather than forcibly trying to kiss her in a work environment.</p> \n<p>Each sentence begs forgiveness for his crimes while rewriting the charges against him. “I didn’t recognize the power my career had given me,” Shavit laments, sounding coached. “And I didn’t internalize the responsibility inherent in this power,” he adds, again neglecting to mention Berrin’s charges that he “continued to pull and paw” at her as she tried to get away.</p> \n<p>Shavit’s ability to proclaim his adoration for Berrin – “I admire her courage and fortitude” – while never acknowledging her actual experience is sneaky. His claim that he has undergone a total reckoning concerning gendered power dynamics and announcement of fealty to the #MeToo movement is eroded by the fact that he never acknowledges the three other women who have also gone on record anonymously reporting that he harassed them.</p> \n<p>He uses lingo ripped from a gender studies textbook, like how he’s learned to see himself as a “privileged white man,” to endear himself to women of the age and milieu of those he is accused of wronging without acknowledging those women.</p> \n<p>“Certain people with certain personal, political and partisan agendas, were manipulating the situation in order to get rid of me,” this purported feminist writes.</p> \n<p>Deftly, insidiously, he paints himself as a victim of #MeToo.</p> \n<p>Shavit’s treacly, gruesomely self-flagellating, and duplicitous narrative proves that he is only sorry he’s in trouble, not that he’s sorry for the many women whose lives he has hurt.</p> \n<p>Even Shavit’s interviewer rewrites history to minimize Shavit’s crimes in the introduction to the interview.</p> \n<p>Kamir writes that “the encounter ends without incident,” which is patently false; both Shavit and Berrin agree that the night contained a major incident – in Shavit’s narrative “inappropriate behavior,” in Berrin’s “sexual assault.” Kamir also says that Berrin “describes in her newspaper his belligerent and coarse behavior toward her that evening” which is erroneous — Berrin describes Shavit lunging, grabbing her head, and sexually propositioning her. The title of Berrin’s article is “My Sexual Assault, and Yours: Every Woman’s Story.”</p> \n<p>The minimization of the violence of the crimes Shavit is accused of leaks from his own self-justification to the framing narrative of the Haaretz piece. This is unacceptable.</p> \n<p>Shavit doesn’t need to come back. He can do complete teshuva without reinserting himself in the public sphere as an expert and celebrated intellectual.</p> \n<p>He has the moral obligation to apologize for his actions and work to understand them. But a return to acclaim and power, which is what he appears to be aiming for here, is not a right; it is a privilege. And it is one self-respecting Jews should deny him.</p> \n<p>We, the public, need to let Shavit do teshuva and rejoin the world as a private citizen; he could do great work as a teacher, perhaps, or a librarian. Perhaps he could find work counseling men like himself. But he has exempted himself from celebrity status by proving that he is incapable of the responsibly of holding that position.</p> \n<p>Shavit owes Danielle Berrin and any other women he harmed a true apology. But we do not owe Ari Shavit a position in the spotlight as an intellectual leader.</p> \n<p>This article was originally published in The Forward on July 5, 2018 and can be found here.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>There are 33,000 stray dogs in Israel, 60 percent of which are in the southern part of the country, according to the first survey of its kind to be conducted locally by Humane Society International, last year.</p> \n<p>The global animal-protection organization is involved, among other activities, in neutering and vaccinating strays and returning them to the locations where they are picked up. The survey was conducted on behalf of Let the Animals Live Israel, an NGO that believes that HSI's approach is a compassionate alternative to the widespread shooting and killing of these animals. Advocates of approach claim that sterilization and inoculation make it possible to exert tighter control over the population of strays. Moreover, studies have shown that such measures also rein in rabies more effectively than killing the dogs.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Archaeology of dogs: Were they first domesticated in the Middle East?</p> \n<p>The survey is the first step in a nationwide plan by HSI, the international arm of the Humane Society of the United States, to actively address the problem of stray dogs in Israel. The results show that there are some 19,860 stray dogs in the south of the country, mostly in the vicinity of the Negev Bedouin communities that have been established without government authorization. There are slightly more than 10,000 of them in the north, mostly near smaller locales. Surveyors found that there were relatively small populations of the dogs in the Jerusalem and Tel Aviv areas.</p> \n<p>The editors of the HSI project, Rahul Sehgal and Amit Chaudhari, acknowledged that their ability to carry out the study and to accurately analyze the situation in the south was limited by the fact that some of the communities there are unrecognized, and they noted that the actual number of strays is likely to be even higher in those areas.</p> \n<p>HSI intends to carry out additional research in these locations, where it is clear that a particularly intensive effort will be required to deal with the stray dog problem, according to organization officials.</p> \n<p>“We have taken responsibility [for an issue] that should have been the province of the Agriculture Ministry,” said Yael Arkin, director of Let the Animals Live Israel. “From here on in, it is the responsibility of the government and the Agriculture Ministry in particular to adopt the report’s findings, especially its recommendations. Solutions such as the indiscriminate shooting of dogs, as is carried out periodically in Israel, have proved ineffective and have even resulted in an increase in the number of strays.”</p> \n<p>During last year’s visit by HSI, the Agriculture Ministry stated that it opposes the organization’s approach of releasing stray dogs after they have been captured and treated.</p> \n<p>For its part, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority said it is unaware of any country in which the HSI approach has been successful in reducing dog populations.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is a menace. The man who is supposed to represent American interests here is in fact an ambassador of the settlers, as evidenced by numerous actions and remarks before, and after, his appointment by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Friedman donates to settlements. Among other things, he gave an ambulance to Har Bracha. When my colleague Gideon Levy criticized him for this in Haaretz (February 8), Friedman lashed out at the newspaper in an ingenuous tweet: “Have they no decency?” This is the same man who called supporters of the liberal American Jewish organization J Street “worse than kapos,” referring to Jews who cooperated with the Nazis during the Holocaust. He warned that evacuating Israeli settlements would lead to civil war and was photographed in Bnei Brak with an image of Jerusalem’s Old City that had been altered to show a rebuilt Temple replacing the Dome of the Rock. In addition, he alone was responsible for extending a personal invitation to the extremist evangelical Southern Baptist Pastor Robert Jeffress (who among other things has said that Jews and other non-Christians are destined for hell, and that Islam promotes pedophilia) to give the opening prayer at the dedication of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Last week that arrogant man told journalists who criticized Israeli army snipers for firing on Palestinian demonstrators at the Gazan border to “keep your mouths shut.” He added that his comments were aimed mainly “at my friends in the United States and one Israeli newspaper I’ve been known to criticize” – likely a reference to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Keep your mouths shut: Ambassador David Friedman's crude pro-Israel activism devalues U.S. diplomacy | Opinion ■&nbsp;Democrats chide David Friedman for playing partisan politics with Israel ■&nbsp;Top Islamic institution slams U.S. Ambassador Friedman over 'mosque-free' photo of Jerusalem Temple &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>And so we find ourselves in a bizarre situation, in which the U.S. ambassador to Israel is rudely and brutally ordering Israeli journalists to “shut your mouths.” His remarks smack of dictatorship. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert backed Friedman and stressed his right to freedom of expression. How absurd, callous and jarring. In the name of freedom of expression, Friedman is permitted to deny Israeli journalists the freedom to criticize their own government.</p> \n<p>This bears the marks of fascism. The ambassador of the most powerful nation in the world orders Israeli journalists to shut up and stop criticizing their government. As the highest-ranking representative of the United States in Israel, he is attempting to silence criticism of the Israeli government and to curtail journalistic freedom of expression. In a democracy, no one has the right to tell journalists to “shut your mouths.” When the ambassador of a foreign power does so, it is a dangerous and grievous act. Friedman translates the fact that many of the opinions that are expressed in Haaretz and in American newspapers are unacceptable to him into a right to call for their silencing. As a rule, U.S. ambassadors do not go around the countries where they are posted and order journalists who criticize the government to shut up. On the face of it, this gives the Netanyahu government the status of a puppet regime operated by Trump that enjoys protection from its domestic critics.</p> \n<p>It appears that Friedman derives his right to silence journalists in Israel not only from his intrinsic status as the ambassador of a superpower that extends its patronage over Israel, but also as a Jew. He seems to think that because he is Jewish and Israel is the Jewish state, it is therefore his state. He behaves here like a proprietor, with dual authority: as a Jew and as an official representative of a superpower. He aspires, and may also succeed, to aid in shaping Israel’s identity.</p> \n<p>Everyone who supports journalistic freedom and opposes the occupation must now take off their gloves. As a result of his behavior and his remarks, Friedman lost his legitimacy. If anyone should shut his mouth, he should. He is a guest here, and he will not silence Israeli journalists.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The cabinet unanimously approved Sunday the long-awaited, controversial reform plan for Israel’s electricity industry. The vote belied serious doubts about the cost and efficacy of the overhaul and revived debate about curbing the power of public-sector trade unions.</p> \n<p>The vote followed a tense debate, largely focused on the plan’s drawbacks. Cabinet ministers Naftali Bennett, Ayelet Shaked and Arye Dery asking tough questions.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu surprised cabinet members with angry remarks about the power of unions, like the ones that in effect control the state-owned Israel Electric Corporation and have tied the government’s hands in introducing reforms.</p> \n<p>“A hundred years ago there was a need for unions, when long hours of child labor was widespread. Today, instead of protecting workers, they harm the public far more. Today we need to protect the public from the workers,” Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>He said that for 22 years, since he was first elected prime minster in 1996, he had fought to rein in labor unions, without success. Nevertheless, he expressed the consensus in the cabinet that the current reform plan was the best they were likely to get.</p> \n<p>“Better reform than no reform, it contains positive elements for the industry,” Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The plan, which was negotiated among the treasury, the Histadrut labor federation and the IEC, will loosen the grip of the company and the unions on the industry and cut costs at the IEC.</p> \n<p>Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who was responsible for developing the plan, remained its advocate and has declined to support plans to limit public-sector unions’ right to strike.</p> \n<p>Kahlon said the cabinet had resolved to reform the IEC 22 years ago. “We must be truthful; the seven previous governments failed the challenge. I know everyone is preoccupied with who won and who lost, but I can already tell you who the real winners are: Israelis,” he told the cabinet.</p> \n<p>“We insisted that private producers would be able to sell electricity directly to the consumer because they deserve to benefit from competition and the lower rates it will ensure,” he said.</p> \n<p>Under the plan, IEC will sell five of its power plants to private companies, but it will be allowed to build two new ones — to be managed by a separate subsidiary. Systems planning will be spun off to a separate state-owned company, which should make it easier for rival power companies to connect to the IEC’s grid.</p> \n<p>The IEC will cut its payroll by about 25%, or 1,800 workers, and the IEC will be helped to reduce its debt. The total cost of the plan is 7.1 billion shekels ($2 billion), of which 6.4 billion will be used for severance pay and enhanced pensions for IEC workers.</p> \n<p>It was the cost of the plan and the fact that the public will be paying for it that raised the most objections to the plan. The 7.1 billion shekels will come from IEC rates not being reduced for the next eight years, despite the expected decline in the utility’s expenses.</p> \n<p>Detractors also criticized the plan for allowing the IEC to build two new plants without first selling five existing ones. They are also concerned that it lets the IEC enter new sectors and doesn’t include incentives for it to invest in the national transmission grid.</p> \n<p>These issues are likely to be revisited in the Knesset, where some parts of the reform need to be legislated.</p> \n<p>A point of contention at Sunday’s cabinet meeting was the government’s decision not to appeal to the High Court of Justice in a suit seeking to bar unions representing workers at public-sector monopolies from striking to block reforms. The government appealed after the National Labor Court handed down a decision granting them the right.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and fellow cabinet members argued that not seeking a High Court ruling weakened the government’s hand against the unions. Kahlon said the reform shouldn’t be tied to the right to strike.</p> \n<p>In any case, Netanyahu committed to withdrawing the government’s appeal if the reform package was reached with the unions by deadline, which it was. As a result, the appeal will be dropped.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and Shaked proposed at the cabinet meeting that the government return to the issue in the form of legislation or a new appeal to the High Court in the event unions oppose structural reforms in the future.</p> \n<p>Bennett said he would bring a proposal to the ministerial legislative committee within two weeks to ban strikes against structural reform. Netanyahu expressed support for the move.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Taking on the NFL and football’s Super Bowl champs,U.S. President Donald Trump gave the boot to a White House ceremony for the Philadelphia Eagles on Tuesday and instead threw his own brief “Celebration of America” after it became clear most players weren’t going to show up.</p> \n<p>Both sides traded hot accusations about who was to blame.&nbsp;Trump himself made headlines at the rally for apparently forgetting the words to &quot;God Bless America.&quot; Video shows the president attempting to sing-along with a military band standing behind him.</p> \n<p>Trump tried to turn the fracas into a referendum on patriotism and tie it to the dispute over players who have taken a knee during the national anthem to protest racism and police brutality. However, Eagles players never knelt during the “Star-Spangled Banner,” throughout the 2017 season and their march to the Super Bowl. Fox News, a known news source for Trump, was rebuked and apologized this week for showing images of Eagles players kneeling while praying on the field as evidence they protested the National Anthem.</p> \n<p>The White House accused Eagles team members of pulling a “political stunt” and abandoning their fans by backing out at the last minute. Indeed, few apparently were going to come, though some expressed disappointment that they’d been disinvited and complained Trump was unfairly painting them as anti-American.</p> \n<p>Through it all, Trump appeared to revel in fanning the flames of a culture war that he believes revs up his political base.</p> \n<p>Trump had long been leery of the Eagles’ planned visit to the White House, in part because the team’s owner, Jeffrey Lurie, has been a Trump critic, and because several players have been vocal critics of the league’s new policy that requires players to stand if they’re on the field during the national anthem or else stay in the locker room.</p> \n<p>White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the team notified the White House last Thursday that 81 people, including players, coaches, managers and others would be attending the Super Bowl celebration. But she said the team got back in touch late Friday and tried to reschedule, “citing the fact that many players would not be in attendance.” The Eagles proposed a time when Trump would be overseas.</p> \n<p>Eagles officials declined comment on the White House version of events, sticking with a simple earlier statement: “We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.”</p> \n<p>No one connected with the team said the players’ reluctance to attend had anything to do with the national anthem, as Trump tried to portray the situation. And comments by star players in the current pro basketball finals indicated it’s not about football.</p> \n<p>“I know no matter who wins this series, no one wants the invite anyway. So it won’t be Golden State or Cleveland going,” said LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. There was no disagreement from Stephen Curry, who angered Trump last year when he said he wouldn’t go to the White House after the Warriors’ NBA triumph, leading the president to disinvite him and his team.</p> \n<p>Trump, furious about the small number of Eagles who were coming, scrapped Tuesday’s visit, believing a low turnout would reflect poorly upon him. He had told aides last year he was embarrassed when Tom Brady, star quarterback of that season’s champion New England Patriots, opted to skip a White House visit.</p> \n<p>Instead, the president held what he dubbed a “patriotic celebration” that was short and spare. A military band and chorus delivered the Star-Spangled Banner and God Bless America, with brief Trump remarks sandwiched in between.</p> \n<p>“We love our country, we respect our flag and we always proudly stand for the national anthem,” Trump said.</p> \n<p>The White House crowd of roughly 1,000, mostly dressed in business suits, was light on Pennsylvanians and heavy on administration and GOP Party officials. Several in attendance blamed the players, not the president, for torpedoing the Eagles event.</p> \n<p>John Killion, a lifelong Eagles fan who now lives in Florida and traveled to Washington to see his team, said he was “devastated and infuriated” by a breakdown he blamed on the Eagles owners.</p> \n<p>“I waited my whole life for the Eagles to win the Super Bowl and they were going to be congratulated at the White House. And I don’t really care who you like or dislike, it shouldn’t be about that,” he said.</p> \n<p>Bill Fey, a Republican state committeeman from southern New Jersey and an Eagles fan, called the decision “a black eye as far as I’m concerned with the NFL. I think that everyone should come to the White House. This is the peoples’ house.” Still, he said, “I think the Eagles did what they thought was necessary. I don’t blame anyone.”</p> \n<p>Trump’s own patriotic event was not without its controversy. Following the playing of the anthem, a heckler shouted from the audience: “Stop hiding behind the armed services and the national anthem!” prompting boos. A Swedish reporter posted video of a man kneeling as the anthem was played.</p> \n<p>In a statement Monday, Trump placed the blame on Eagles players he said “disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.”</p> \n<p>Besides the fact that none of the Eagles had taken a knee during the anthem in 2017, defensive end Chris Long said the NFL anthem policy change and Trump’s reaction to it were not even discussed by the players in meetings about making the visit.</p> \n<p>Those deciding to stay away had various reasons beyond Trump’s opposition to the protests, including more general feelings of hostility toward the president, one official said.</p> \n<p>Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, who had planned to skip the ceremony “to avoid being used as any kind of pawn,” said in a statement that at the White House a “decision was made to lie, and paint the picture that these players are anti-America, anti-flag and anti-military.”</p> \n<p>Trump has long railed against the protests that began in 2016 when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began silently kneeling on the sidelines during the anthem to raise awareness around racism and, specifically, the killing of black men by police.</p> \n<p>At a rally last September, Trump suggested NFL owners fire “son of a bitch” players who “disrespect” the flag by kneeling.</p> \n<p>As for politics, Trump believes the anthem controversy is a winning issue for him and was pleased that last month’s announcement of the league’s new policy returned it to the news, according to people familiar with the president’s thinking but not authorized to discuss private conversations.</p> \n<p>Even so, Trump made clear Tuesday he doesn’t believe the policy goes far enough, tweeting: “Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!”</p> \n<p>The president told one confidant Monday that he aims to revive the issue in the months leading up to the midterm elections, believing its return to the headlines will help Republicans win votes.</p> \n<p>Trump’s attempt to drive a wedge between the team and its fervent fan base could have political consequences in Pennsylvania, which Trump won by just 44,000 votes in 2016.</p> \n<p>The politics are already playing out in the state’s Senate race, where Republican Rep. Lou Barletta is challenging Democratic incumbent Bob Casey.</p> \n<p>Barletta attended the White House ceremony sans Eagles, “representing the proud Pennsylvanians who stand for our flag.” Casey tweeted he would be “skipping this political stunt at the White House” and invited the Eagles on a tour of the Capitol instead.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Perhaps in 50 years, when a scholar of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict settles down to write its history, he will begin his book as follows:</p> \n<p>In 1971, the United States sent its ping-pong team to a showcase competition in China. This was the first step toward breaking the wall of hostility that had existed between the two powers since the Korean War. It was the first step toward rapprochement between the two powers. In 2018, the Argentine national team canceled its showcase match against the Israeli national team, under heavy pressure from opponents of the occupation in Argentina and Spain. This was a significant step on the long route toward ending the occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>Excitement over sports has a cathartic effect, like a strong national or religious experience. A month after the evangelical-fascist spectacle in Jerusalem starring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Trump family and some Christian clergymen, a display that bowled a whole nation over with just that type of excitement, came the great fall.</p> \n<p>It had seemed as if nothing could stand in the way of Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump, the two smug thugs who were drunk with success and going from strength to strength, accompanied by a vulgar and delusional cheering squad led by Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev. And then came a soccer team – one of the best in the world, headed by a superstar with millions of fans in Israel and abroad – and said, “We’re not playing your game.” And despite all the excuses that the cancellation was due to professional considerations of a team preparing for the World Cup or because of security concerns, the meaning is clear. Argentina has determined that an Israel holding spectacles in Jerusalem while the Palestinians are being oppressed and gunned down is not its playing field.</p> \n<p>The cancellation of Argentina’s game in Israel must be a holiday for all peace-loving people and those who support a vision of a different Israel. It requires millions of Israelis – not just soccer fans – to look in the mirror and ask themselves honestly: Why is this happening?</p> \n<p>The effect of canceling the game could be much more dramatic than canceling a researcher’s invitation to a university conference abroad, or removing cherry tomatoes grown in the settlements from the shelves of a few supermarkets in London. After all, what will Lionel Messi’s hundreds of thousands of Israeli fans do now? Will they stop traveling to Barcelona to watch him play?</p> \n<p>If they do that, it will be a real crisis; for a sports fan, abandoning a beloved team and transferring support to its rival (Real Madrid, alas!), is almost like converting to another religion. That’s exactly what the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is trying to do – get masses of Israelis to deal with the consequences to their comfort zones of oppression and occupation, and to make their daily lives less convenient. That’s why the cancellation of the game is so significant.</p> \n<p>Sports stars and artists who are admired by millions can influence and shock public opinion far more effectively than politicians, academics and intellectuals. There are quite a few examples of athletes who have shaped historical memory and become symbols of the struggle against oppression, racism and violence, even if that was not their original intention.</p> \n<p>Jesse Owens, the black athlete who gave the finger to the Nazi dictator when he defeated all those German purebreds at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, is a good example. Another example is Tommie Smith and John Carlos, also black American athletes, who stood on the podium at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics after winning medals in the 200-meter dash, wearing human rights tags and raising black-gloved fists while the American national anthem played, to protest American racism. This gesture advanced the struggle for civil rights in those years more than any academic conference. Messi’s thunderous absence from the soccer field in Jerusalem – the capital of Israel and the symbol of the occupation – may lead him to be remembered for more than just the way he plays.</p> \n<p>In light of the debate over the last few weeks in Haaretz about the correct path for the Israeli left – partial annexation, no partial annexation, yes to the Labor Party, no to the Labor Party – Argentina’s decision not to come here presents a new challenge.</p> \n<p>The next likely stage will be a major effort in Europe to pressure artists and public broadcasting corporations not to participate in the next celebration planned in Jerusalem – the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019. The voice of peace-seekers and opponents of the occupation in Israel must be heard. As long as Israel turns sports and culture events into showcases that give legitimacy to “Miri Regev Productions,” we will not attend them and we will convince others in Israel and around the world to do the same.</p> \n<p>Such a decision has moral, Jewish and historical legitimacy. In March 1933 there was a meeting in New York of Jewish public figures led by Rabbi Stephen Wise, president of the American Jewish Congress and an important Zionist leader, where it was decided to call on the American public to boycott German products being imported to America because of the anti-Jewish policies of Nazi Germany. It was not a simple decision. It was not clear what the U.S. administration’s response would be and there was also a risk that American anti-Semitism would intensify. But Wise tipped the scales in favor of the decision, saying, “The time for moderation and caution has passed. We have to make our voices heard as human beings.”</p> \n<p>Prof. Blatman is a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem</p>",

        "text":["<p>I recently spent a week in Warsaw at a culinary forum that brought together international chefs, journalists and experts in culinary tourism. Terroir, the organization behind the event, which is held in a different city each year, is dedicated to promoting the growth of international culinary communities through discussions, lectures, workshops and shared meals.</p> \n<p>As Israelis, citizens of a young nation of immigrants without a single clear culinary tradition, we often go to great lengths in trying to define the national cuisine. And we’re not alone. In recent years, thanks to the increasingly rapid pace of globalization, it seems like practically every country is striving to define its national cuisine.</p> \n<p>At the Warsaw forum, JP McMahon, a chef from Galway who founded Food on the Edge, a symposium for chefs and food enthusiasts, pondered just what Irish food is: “The first people who came to Ireland must have been fleeing from someone. There’s no other reason to have settled on this arid island.” Maksut Askar, a son of Syrian parents who grew up in Turkey’s Hatay Province, and owner of one of the most famous restaurants in Istanbul, asked himself and the audience where home really is. Estonians, Poles and Germans debated whether there is such a thing as Baltic cuisine. Polish chefs ruefully noted the successful branding of Nordic cuisine (“Are we southern Nordic cuisine?”). It’s a big world, food products are dynamic and easily pass from one place to the other, and, ultimately, most humans on this planet – whether from Australia, Israel or Turkey – are descendants of migrants.</p> \n<p>“Nevertheless, the nation is a very powerful concept, and the more it is threatened, as it is now through globalization, the more members of a nation feel the need to defend it. How do we defend the nation?” says Dr. Ronald Ranta, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at London’s Kingston University, when asked why we feel the need to define our national food. Ranta’s research concerns the connection between food and nationalism, and he has published two books on the subject in the recent years.</p> \n<p>“The important thing to understand with regard to national food is the impact of globalization,” Ranta says. “In a globalized world, countries, regions and cities compete to be distinct and different. They all want to attract investment and project themselves as&nbsp;attractive&nbsp;and special. Part of the need to define and assert national food is a reaction to the challenges and problems globalization creates. For example, until the early 2000s the biggest producers of Feta cheese in Europe were Denmark and Germany. They were taken to court by Greece, which asserted its ‘national’ right to be the only Feta producing country.</p> \n<p>“If we accept the national claim that food originates in a particular place, is produced in a particular manner, and is imbued with particular characteristics because of the local&nbsp;environment&nbsp;(what many refer to as terroir – and which I often think they take it too far ... something I refer to as terroirrism ...then because of globalization we are driven to want and to&nbsp;consume the original, the authentic product, the real thing,&nbsp;and not a distant&nbsp;version.</p> \n<p>This is at the heart of the current drive to assert national rights to food and to claim or reclaim food as authentic.&nbsp;This type of activity, of asserting national rights to food is often referred to as gastronationalism,” Ranta explains.</p> \n<p>The need to associate cultural products with specific groups is a normal human need. “The famous saying by Brillat-Savarin ‘tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are’ is very good example,” Ranta points out. “If we think of what we eat, it mostly&nbsp;corresponds&nbsp;to our&nbsp;gender, class, political, ethnic, religious, and national identity. The fact that people perceive food as belonging to nations is not a problem in and of&nbsp;itself. So what if pasta is seen as Italian and Sushi as Indian.</p> \n<p>“If we think about it further, do we really care who claims ownership of what food item? Does it matter whether baklava is Greek or Turkish or belongs to someone else? Does it really matter who claims ownership of falafel or hummus?” he asks.</p> \n<p>“Well, it does when a national cause or agenda is behind the claim. The Greek claim to ownership of Feta was not simply about the need to draw consumers’ attention to its claim. There are also important political and economic factors behind this. Greece is now the only country in Europe that is allowed to produce Feta,” says Ranta, adding, “If we think of the recent ‘hummus wars’, a large&nbsp;part of the ‘war’ was about access to the American market. Israel’s assertion, through Israeli companies, of hummus as an Israeli dish is part of a strategy to conquer the U.S. hummus market, which is worth billions!”</p> \n<p>Citizen of the world</p> \n<p>Ranta was born in South Africa in 1975; both his parents are Israeli. “My mom comes from a very Zionist family that came from Romania and Hungary in the early 20th century. And my dad came to Israel as a teenager, also from Romania, in the 1960s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The fact that my origins point to eastern Europe (mostly Romania) and Israel, though I was born in South Africa and lived most of my life in the U.K. explains well my fascination with nationalism and national identity. I have never thought of myself as belonging to a particular nation. What is interesting is I ended up marrying someone who is very similar to me in that regard. She is half British, half Venezuelan, and grew up in France and Nigeria. I am dreading the moment that my son, who is now five, asks me ‘Daddy what am I?’”</p> \n<p>Ranta moved to London to study filmmaking. “I started working in an Israeli&nbsp;restaurant&nbsp;to fund myself through university and then reached the realization that maybe I should pursue a career as a chef. So I did chef studies for a number of years and worked in a number of high-end&nbsp;restaurants in London... My partner was unhappy with my long working&nbsp;hours, so we both thought of what else I could do. I have always been interested in politics and international relations, so I made a decision to change careers and here I am.</p> \n<p>“If we think of what Israeli food is and how this concept has evolved over time we uncover a fascinating story,” he says.&nbsp;“A story of how an Ashkenazi, European,&nbsp;mostly non-religious, socialist hegemony,&nbsp;tried to create an Israeli food culture based on European ideas,&nbsp;local ingredients, self-sufficiency, and&nbsp;scientific ideas of nutrition. With the exception of integrating local ingredients, it failed miserably! With the exception of schnitzel, there is very little of European and Ashkenazi food culture we associate with being Israeli.</p> \n<p>“In this regard, the story of how sabich or shakshuka became national dishes is very illuminating.&nbsp;Instead, what&nbsp;we think of as&nbsp;Israeli food is food that is of the region, is in line with kashrut laws – there are no non-kosher Israeli national foods and most of what is&nbsp;considered&nbsp;Israeli national food is mostly pareve, which demonstrates the power of kashrut even on those who don’t keep it!” Ranta goes on, “What is considered&nbsp;Israeli national food is&nbsp;Mediterranean&nbsp;and Middle Eastern.&nbsp;The Israeli food that is now claiming prizes across the world and is supported by the Israeli government as a way of&nbsp;promoting&nbsp;a different vision of Israel, is an amalgamation of various&nbsp;influences, but mostly&nbsp;Mizrahi Jewish, North African, Balkan,&nbsp;Arab, Turkish and Palestinian food.</p> \n<p>“Another interesting thing we discover when looking at Israeli food is how little Jewish-Israelis have been willing to admit that they have been influenced by Arab food, and even less so&nbsp;by Palestinian food. Now, I am not saying that Israeli national food has only been influenced by Arab and Palestinian food, of course not, there are many influences. And&nbsp;I, as you can imagine, am not going to claim there is an essentialist thing such as Palestinian food. Palestinian food has to be seen as part of the regional Shami food culture [of Greater Syria]. But it is interesting to think of why Jewish Israelis have been so reluctant to admit that they&nbsp;share&nbsp;a lot in common with Arab and Palestinian food&nbsp;(though it is clear that in recent years there has been a slow but gradual shift toward accepting this).&nbsp;In this regard, instead of using Israeli food to bridge differences between&nbsp;communities&nbsp;and nations, because of the similarities, it is used to assert difference and claim&nbsp;national ownership.”&nbsp;</p>",

The host country, Portugal, which won last year’s Eurovision, drew its exact starting position at eight.</p> \n<p>Co-written by Doron Medalie and Stav Berger, &quot;Toy&quot; garnered an impressive following of over 17 million views on YouTube and even hit the No. 1 spot on Spotify Israel. The winning song is also featured on the iTunes hit parade at home and in Europe.</p> \n<p>Thanking the audience for their vote, the 25-year-old singer praised their choice to accept diversity and for choosing something different.

People waved Israeli flags while chanting Barzilai’s victorious song over and over again. Some chanted “who’s not jumping supported Cyprus,” teasing the Cyprus entry in Eurovision who seemed close to winning until Barzilai received a disproportionate amount of votes from the public.</p> \n<p>“It means a lot to us, after 70 years Israel is finally on the map, we did not expect so many votes from European countries,” said some Barzilai supporters in the square who didn't want to reveal their names. “Next year we want to see Eurovision in our capital, that is Jerusalem!” they concluded.</p> \n<p>Ratings peak</p> \n<p>Netta Barzilai’s Eurovision win brought the highest ratings for the contest in Israel since 2005, with 1.05 million viewers watched her performance Saturday night on Israel's new state broadcaster Kan. This is also the highest ratings for television viewing in Israel since Channel 2 split in November 2017, a major reshuffle in the television market. The previously highest ratings last week were for the launch of “Big Brother.”</p> \n<p>Kan reported that the Eurovision contest was watched online by 750,000 views, either on Facebook or its mobile application. Barzilai’s song, “Toy” has had more than 50 million views so far on You Tube.</p> \n<p>The all-time highest Eurovision ratings in Israel still belongs to the broadcast in 1999 of the song contest in Israel, featuring the band Eden – 1.34 million views. Ratings in Jewish households (a figure used in&nbsp; television commercial marketing), were 35 percent on Saturday night, as opposed to 48.9 percent in 1999.</p> \n<p>Peak viewing on Saturday night was when Barzilai took to the stage, with 1.45 million viewers tuned in.

But, at least in the case of one shunned nation, you would be wrong.</p> \n<p>As the one-year anniversary of the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar approaches, reports by international organizations suggest the small Persian Gulf emirate has not only turned around its dire financial prospects but also improved its human rights record and geopolitical standing.</p> \n<p>The “Qatar crisis,” as the land, air and sea blockade by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates quickly became known, was meant to break the Qatari economy and force the country’s emir to give in to a set of demands from the Saudis - namely to fall in line with Saudi leadership of the Gulf, shut down Al Jazeera and cut ties with Saudi arch enemy Iran. The tiny emirate of roughly 2.5 million people, led by the 37-year-old Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has refused to comply with any of the demands and remained defiant in the face of pressure from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, 32, and his campaign for regional domination.</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the crisis - which many dubbed the biggest split in the Arab world since the Gulf War - hysteria set in as Qataris swarmed supermarkets fearing food shortages, the stock market collapsed and even hundreds of camels ended up dead as the Saudis closed the border.</p> \n<p>As the crisis continued fears of a Saudi-led military incursion into Qatar grew - although with the U.S.’s largest military base in the Middle East located in the country that seemed unlikely. Doha turned for support to Turkey, which deployed troops to Qatar and, along with Iran, sent food and supplies. In the following months there were regular complaints of Qatari and UAE jet interceptions, reports of a missing Sheikh and even a Saudi plan to turn Qatar into an island - cutting the peninsula off with a maritime-canal, turning the border area into a military zone and nuclear waste site.</p> \n<p>New trade routes</p> \n<p>In the initial weeks after the blockade was announced, Qatar’s imports dropped nearly 40 percent from the same time a year earlier. &nbsp;Today those numbers have returned to normal as Doha, the world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas, responded by developing new trade routes, propping up its banks with state money and helping local firms develop domestic output of some goods - including food. Qatar has also begun to develop the world’s largest LNG field that it shares with Iran in the Persian Gulf</p> \n<p>According to an International Monetary Fund report from March, Qatar’s banking system has recovered from initial outflows and the economy is expected to grow 2.6 percent this year&nbsp;- compared to 2.1 percent in 2017. Even the country’s fiscal deficit is estimated to have narrowed to about 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 from 9.2 percent in 2016 , the IMF said.</p> \n<p>As Forbes notes, Doha’s foreign reserves increased by $2.9 billion to $17.7 billion, HSBC said in a report to clients on Monday, adding that the stronger position was in part supported by continued improvement in Qatar’s trade balance.</p> \n<p>Human rights</p> \n<p>Qatar has long been the focus of criticism for human rights abuses as its foreign labor policy, the Kafala system, has resulted in widespread abuse and been dubbed a form of modern-day slavery. Human rights activists have long called for boycotts of the 2022 World Cup, which will be hosted in Qatar, due to the high number of worker deaths related to the event. One 2017 report published by the International Trades Union Confederation (ITUC) estimated some 1200 workers had already died building the venues, with years of work still ahead. Qataris, living under an absolute monarchy, also have very limited civil liberties, but both men and women are slated to vote in the first free elections for the country’s largely ceremonial parliament in 2019.</p> \n<p>Human Rights Watch has praised Qatar in its World Report 2018 - entitled, “Qatar: Year of Crisis Spurred Rights Reforms.” The report credits Qatar for a range of significant human rights reforms during 2017 that if fully implemented “would usher in some of the most progressive human rights standards in the gulf region.”</p> \n<p>The reforms include legislation that would improve labor standards for migrant workers, including a domestic workers law, and a draft law granting permanent residency to children born to Qatari mothers and foreign fathers and to some foreign residents living in the country.</p> \n<p>The West is happy to sell weapons</p> \n<p>Qatar is one of the most heavily invested countries in the world. For such a small country, it wields an oversized influence on global politics largely because it has invested hundreds of billions of its energy wealth, through its national wealth fund, in companies and property (there is a “Qatari quarter” in London) overseas - although it is nowhere in the ballpark of countries like China or Norway.</p> \n<p>Qatar now wants the favor returned and is moving ahead with legislation that will allow full foreign ownership of companies operating in the country, which is much broader step than a more limited measure proposed recently by Saudi Arabia - which is competing with Qatar for new international business.</p> \n<p>Qatar’s Ministry of Economy and Commerce is promoting the law overseas as providing many incentives to foreign investors including &quot;exemption from customs duties and possibility of exemption from income tax.” The legislation follows a directive from the emir last year to open up the economy.</p> \n<p>Qatar’s struggle against the blockade also includes lucrative arms deals. To ensure its stability, the emirate paid almost $1 billion to build the Al Udeid Air Base in the 1990s, where U.S. CENTCOM is headquartered and the British Royal Air Force also operates.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the Saudis announced their blockade, U.S. President Donald Trump joined in and called Qatar “a funder of terrorism at a high level” - an endorsement of the blockade that surprised even the U.S. State Department which was working to “ease tensions.” Later that same week the U.S. signed a $12 billion deal to sell fighter jets to Qatar, as two U.S. warships arrived to carry out joint military exercises with the country. Months later, in December 2017, Qatar announced it would buy fighter jets and armored vehicles from France as part of 12 billion euro deal.</p> \n<p>Qatar has also engaged in a year-long public relations campaign in Washington, D.C. to clean-up its image - including courting prominent U.S. Jewish leaders. The emirate has even gone as far as too engage in talks to purchase Newsmax - a right-leaning news agency owned by a close-friend of Trump. Allegations of decades of funding terrorism, including its long sponsorship of Hamas and its leaders, have not been forgotten so quickly. But, they do not factor largely in this crisis as Saudi Arabia too has been plagued by similar allegations of stoking Islamic extremism. As both countries vye for influence in Washington and the region those competing claims seem to cancel each other out and fall by the wayside.</p> \n<p>As the Qatari crisis enters its second year there is little indication it will resolve anytime soon - but by the looks of it that may be both beneficial to the Qatari economy and the civil liberties of those residing in the tiny energy-rich emirate.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The on-off Spike missile deal between India and Israel is an ongoing saga –&nbsp;&nbsp;a weaponized, geopolitical soap opera.</p> \n<p>Back in 2014, India's state-run&nbsp;Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by the then&nbsp;defence&nbsp;minister, Arun Jaitley, cleared the purchase of 8,000 Spike missiles, over 300 launchers, and technology transfer from Israel to Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), one of India’s state-owned ammunition and missiles manufacturers.</p> \n<p>This $600 million deal to purchase the man portable &quot;fire and forget&quot; Spike missiles, which have a four kilometer range, was hailed as a major&nbsp;milestone in defense cooperation, a &quot;flagship deal that cemented the budding Israeli-Indian security relationship” - a win-win situation for the buyer (India, the world’s largest importer of arms) and the seller (Israel – for whom India would become one of its largest clients).</p> \n<p>In bagging this deal, Israel’s Spike missiles trumped the American Javelin missile. The U.S. lost out, thanks to its reluctance to allow Indian experts to evaluate the missiles and for its initial unwillingness to transfer technology to India. Later, the U.S. offered to co-produce and develop the missiles in India along with India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</p> \n<p>In contrast, Israel, though initially disinclined, then agreed to transfer the technology and produce the missiles as part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s &quot;Make in India&quot; initiative.</p> \n<p>In an unprecedented move, a major private player, Kalyani Strategic Systems Limited (part of the Kalyani Group), was allowed to make military-grade missiles in collaboration with Israel’s state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems.</p> \n<p>The Spike missile deal is the first missile facility to be set up by a private player - thus marking the genesis of India’s private military industrial complex.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A&nbsp;joint venture, 51:49, was set up between the two - Kalyani Rafael Advanced Defence systems. A 24,000 square foot missile development facility sprang up in a nondescript industrial complex in a record ten months on the outskirts of Hyderabad, a city in southern India.</p> \n<p>That facility was also expected to make a wide range of advanced weapons system, such &quot;Command Control and Guidance, Electro-Optics, Remote Weapon Systems, Precision Guided Munitions and System Engineering for System Integration.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, within a few months of setting up the facility, India canceled the Spike missile deal without offering any reasons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Indian media reported that the deal was canceled because &quot;importing Spike Anti-Tank Guided Missiles would adversely affect the indigenous weapons manufacturing system by India’s public sector ammunitions maker, the Defence Research and Development Organization.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, India's DRDO was developing its own Spike alternative: the NAG 190 (Cobra) &quot;fire and forget&quot; Anti-Tank Guided Missile, also with a range of four kilometres. The missiles’ capabilities have few competitors worldwide. It was successfully test-fired at the Pokhran test firing range in Rajasthan's Thar desert.</p> \n<p>However, the Indian army has so far not commented on how successful the testing of the NAG 190 actually was. Since then, the Indian army has&nbsp;delayed its induction, citing high expenses and numerous technical shortcomings, including inadequate thermal sensors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>DRDO promises to deliver them by the end of the year, seeking more time to operationalize them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>India desperately needs to upgrade and modernize its weapons in general. But in this specific case, one of the challenges of this large-scale process has been exposed. The Indian army and the state manufacturer are at loggerheads with each other over defining operational criteria: Serially, at the last minute, the Indian army changes its requirements, and the DRDO keeps missing its deadlines.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That extra time was, and is, a problem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>India’s defense is primarily geared to challenge aggression from its neighbors, Pakistan and China. India&nbsp;fought a war with China in 1962 and three wars with Pakistan&nbsp;since independence in 1947. All three states are nuclear powers. India considers both as strategic threats, whether singly or – in the worst case scenario – together.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But the Indian army faces a severe&nbsp;shortage&nbsp;of anti-tank guided missiles. It is is 60&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;short of what it’s authorized to hold, meaning it needs 68000 rounds and 850 launchers to be at what defense analysts have determined is an adequate state of readiness.</p> \n<p>Though Mr. Modi and his party, the BJP, speak of making&nbsp;India self-reliant in&nbsp;defense, his policies point to a different direction – that of&nbsp;starving public sector defense manufacturers and selling them off to private parties, thuscreating a private military industrial complex.</p> \n<p>In an unprecedented move, the Modi government has&nbsp;reportedly&nbsp;decided not to make any further investments in India’s public sector&nbsp;defense&nbsp;companies – the Ordnance Factory Board and Defence Public Sector Undertakings. Instead, it wants private players to create military products.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Hindu Business Line, a&nbsp;defence&nbsp;ministry official said: &quot;Modernisation, upgrades, repowering, product launches and improvement in operational efficiencies are to be carried out with the help of private players with proven track record.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the same&nbsp;time&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Modi’s government has also decided to sell its stakes in India’s public sector&nbsp;defense&nbsp;undertakings – Bharat Dynamics Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.</p> \n<p>Ironically, the &quot;Make in India&quot; initiative has become a vehicle to facilitate big international defense deals as&nbsp;joint ventures with foreign players in India - Adani’s tie-up with the Swedish SAAB; Reliance’s joint venture with Dassault; Larsen and Toubro’s with France’s MBDA; Tata with Lockheed Martin; Mahindra with Airbus are just a few examples. India becomes the manufacturing site – to manufacture replica products developed abroad, rather than becoming integrated into a higher-value R&amp;D process.</p> \n<p>A few decades ago, India's&nbsp;defense&nbsp;secrets were traded for whisky. A dreadful concoction of wars cooked up in the Cold War era&nbsp;– the Indo-China war and the Indo-Pak war – saw the Russians, the Americans and the French amply profit from India’s conflicts. From that time and into the present day, India’s defense procurement has long been the subject of financial and political corruption scandals.</p> \n<p>Now the playing field is different. The globalization of weapons has brought in new players, with Israel being one of them. Israel has steadily risen up the ranks as an arms supplier to India.</p> \n<p>India’s corporate conglomerates see an opportunity to grab a piece of the pie. They have put a lot of time, money&nbsp;&nbsp;and effort into lobbying, running PR campaigns and creative corporate restructuring to grab a piece of India’s&nbsp;huge&nbsp;defense&nbsp;budget, which stands at around $53.5 billion. Warheads and missiles are the new profit-making machines for India’s conglomerates.</p> \n<p>As regards the Spike missile deal, Netanyahu raised it with Modi on his trip to India earlier this year. After their meeting, on his flight back from Ahmedabad, a jubilant Netanyahu announced to reporters: &quot;They are reauthorizing the Spike deal,&quot; even as his advisers cautioned it could well end up being worth only half the intial $500 million agreed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But the Indian government didn’t confirm Netanyahu’s claim. Mr. Modi knows it’s a politically sensitive issue – especially with elections only a few months away in 2019. Any attempt to acquire weapons from a foreign player will be seen as jeopardizing India’s indigenous weapons manufacturing program.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Israeli-Indian Hyderabad facility is being retasked to manufacture other weapons systems while the decision is being considered and reconsidered, for the fourth year running.</p> \n<p>In election-season India, there’s a lot of political rhetoric about making the country self-reliant vis-a-vis its defense capabilities. It’s a theme that is historically and politically resonant.</p> \n<p>However, there’s far less noise being made about the real beneficiaries of these carefully designed &quot;Made in India&quot; policies – or what it means for India to push the privatization of the means for war.</p> \n<p>A fellow at the University of Oxford's Reuters Institute for the Study of&nbsp;Journalism and a graduate of the London School of Economics, Shrenik Rao is a digital entrepreneur and filmmaker.

        "text":["<p>Recycling garbage is now a vital part of protecting the environment worldwide. The process depends on advanced legislation that targets old industries, especially in developed countries.</p> \n<p>Less well known are recycling’s chronic problems. It depends on the Chinese market, it competes with original raw materials, and it is difficult to separate material in demand from piles of garbage. These problems are getting worse and threaten the recycling process in many countries, including Israel.</p> \n<p>The great upheaval of the recycling industry started after China toughened its demands regarding the trash it receives for recycling. Last month the Wall Street Journal published a report on the impact of this crisis on the United States opening with: “The U.S. recycling industry is breaking down” (May 13).</p> \n<p>The article described the difficulties American factories encounter in shipping cardboard, paper waste and plastic to recycling destinations in China. A large part of the trash eventually ends up in landfills, just like in the pre-cycling era.</p> \n<p>China decided it could no longer accept waste from countries like the United States because it had combined several kinds of trash. This created safety problems and exposed local employees to contaminants. In the past China agreed to accept garbage consisting of up to 20 percent of other materials. For the past four months it has been demanding that the contaminants’ limit be slashed to 0.5 percent. These measures are forcing recycling plants to invest more effort into sorting waste. The repercussions can be seen in the case of Pacific Rim Cycling in California, which has furloughed almost all its employees.</p> \n<p>“The cost is impossible. We can’t make money at it,” company president Steve Moore told WSJ. “We quit accepting stuff.”</p> \n<p>The Chinese stopped accepting mixed paper waste (several kinds of paper) provided by such plants and now huge amounts of paper collected for recycling are piling up.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Down in the dumps: Israel's trash-recycling plans go nowhere</p> \n<p>China isn’t the only problem, a comprehensive report about plastic recycling published last month by the OECD finds. The demand for recycled plastic depends to a large extent on the original material’s supply. With no independent demand, the recycling industry is vulnerable to fluctuating prices of the original plastic, which plunge every time oil prices dip.</p> \n<p>Another difficulty is the competition with trash-burning energy-producing facilities, which receive large amounts of waste. There is also great difficulty in handling recycled material, which is mostly contaminated with other trash, such as food remains and chemicals. It too consists of several kinds of plastic, which complicates the separation process of the desired material. PET – a plastic with an especially high recycling rate – is a special case. The report says its price also depends on cotton prices, as textile companies in China use its fibers as substitute when cotton prices soar.</p> \n<p>The Israeli recycling industry is small and can pick and choose its clients and markets, the Environmental Protection Ministry says. But Israeli factories are also contending with some of the same challenges affecting other countries – first and foremost the effective separation of good quality material.</p> \n<p>The Aviv AMCG management and consulting firm, which runs the Ran Bitton forum for environmental planning, last week held a conference entitled “Waste is changing direction – from nuisance to an energy resource.” The gathering was held in partnership with the Goldfarb Seligman law firm and the Porter School of Environmental Studies in Tel Aviv University. Among the speakers were Offer Bogin, CEO of Greennet, Jerusalem’s waste management facility and Amos Rabin, CEO of the Dan Cities Association for Sanitation and Waste Disposal, which is in charge of the Hiriya landfill and its large waste management facility. These facilities handle close to a third of all Israel’s urban waste.</p> \n<p>According to Bogin and Rabin, these two facilities succeed in extracting only 15 percent of the waste for recycling. “The main difficulty is the material’s lack of homogeneity,” Rabin said. “If its composition isn’t homogeneous, the industry cannot handle it. So it’s hard to impossible to recycle waste.”</p> \n<p>Bogin says the waste handled by Jerusalem’s waste management facility hardly undergoes any separation, which makes it difficult to extract good-quality ingredients for recycling. Recently the Amnir company, a subsidiary of Hadera Paper, stopped taking the paper waste the facility had separated. “We stopped taking the mixed paper because there was too much organic material in it,” said Gadi Konia, Hadera Paper CEO. “It creates humidity that damages the paper quality and harms our machines.”</p> \n<p>Konia said his plant still takes the good-quality cardboard separated at Greennet and believes Hadera Paper handles about half of Israel’s paper waste.</p> \n<p>Despite the numerous difficulties, the local and global recycling industry is not likely to disappear. “Indeed, China’s restriction of recycling waste sent shock waves through the recycling market, but policy isn’t determined by the market’s changing situation but by a deep and thorough analysis,” says Gilad Ostrovsky, director of the sustainability and environment division in the Misgav Regional Council, who recently completed his doctorate on manufacturers’ responsibility for the waste they produce.</p> \n<p>Ostrovsky says waste management policy is shaped on sustainability principles: preserving resources, saving energy and striving for circular economy, which reuses resources. He notes that the European Union continues to support and encourage recycling and lists successful cases, like the Belgian recycling corporation Fost Plus, which served as a model for the Israeli industry.</p> \n<p>Last year the corporation recycled 89.1 percent of domestic packaging. The business recycling rate is even higher. Fost Plus’ edge is in its high-quality recycled materials, which are in high demand. “This shows the economic value of good separation,” Ostrovsky says. “The Chinese crisis is an opportunity to facilitate the development of local management facilities and strengthen the national economy.”</p> \n<p>The OECD report offers several steps to help the world recycling market, such as setting recycling goals in more countries, government aid to build and operate advanced sorting facilities and compelling manufacturers not to include additives in products like plastic. The report recommends helping developing states set up recycling industries and thus reduce huge amounts of waste dumped.</p> \n<p>Some manufacturers aren’t waiting for government assistance. One of Britain’s largest plastic bottle manufacturers Princes set a 50 percent recycling target for plastic bottles within months, after Evian vowed to use 100 percent recycled plastic bottles for all its water by 2025. In Israel, Greennet is examining the possibility of setting up a facility to recycle diapers.&nbsp;</p>",

In the late 19th century, they fought over frozen herring—and these trade wars meant real violence...&nbsp;In December 1877, the first of more than two dozen Gloucester ships had arrived in Fortune Bay, in the island’s southeast. But the herring kept the fleet waiting: By Saturday, January 5th, there were still no fish in the bay. On the 6th, the herring appeared at last, and the Americans, eager to bring the first cargoes back to New England, began to lay their seines. Witnesses on board the ships testified later that over two hundred Newfoundlanders “gathered on the beach and demanded that the seines be taken up, giving a pretext that it was unlawful to fish on the Sabbath.” This crowd then began, the Gloucester shipowner John Pew attested in a petition to the Treasury, “a war-like demonstration.” They overpowered the crews, tore up Pew’s seines, and liberated all the herring.&quot;&nbsp;[TheAtlantic] &nbsp;The Atlantic's David Graham&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;YUM!

        "text":["<p>A “menace,” Rogel Alpher called the U.S. ambassador to Israel in an op-ed (Haaretz, June 10). Alpher complains: “The man who is supposed to represent American interests here is in fact an ambassador of the settlers. ... rudely and brutally ordering Israeli journalists to ‘shut your mouths’” and not criticize the government. According to Alpher, Friedman’s remarks “smack of dictatorship.”</p> \n<p>Alpher’s attack is grave because of the harsh language he uses, but mainly because he is not a lone voice in the wilderness, speaking only for himself. Rather, he represents, if in a provocative manner, leftist criticism motivated by interests. He expresses the perspective of the liberal elite, identified with leftist circles, that cannot accept an American ambassador who is a proud, kippa-wearing Jew who is not ashamed to openly declare his identity.</p> \n<p>To my mind, the worst passage in Alpher’s piece is this: “It appears that Friedman derives his right to silence journalists in Israel not only from his intrinsic status as the ambassador of a superpower that extends its patronage over Israel, but also as a Jew. He seems to think that because he is Jewish and Israel is the Jewish state, it is therefore his state. He behaves here like a proprietor, with dual authority: as a Jew and as an official representative of a superpower.”</p> \n<p>Did Alpher and the left dare attack our great transatlantic friend, on the grounds that it grossly intervened in Israel’s domestic affairs in the time of U.S. President Barak Obama and Ambassador Daniel Shapiro? Did they protest their lack of solidarity with Israel and the American censure of Israel on more than one occasion? At the time, the left argued that we should avoid provoking the United States and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli right wing were wrong to incur the wrath of our greatest ally.</p> \n<p>True, some of Alpher’s claims are correct, but he attaches them to erroneous arguments in order to present Friedman as a secret settler and an extreme right-winger. For example, he criticizes Friedman for being “photographed in Bnei Brak with an image of Jerusalem’s Old City that had been altered to show a rebuilt Temple replacing the Dome of the Rock.” As the photographer of the picture in question showing Friedman with the image, perhaps it’s time for me to set the record straight: Friedman was not aware of the details of the image, which an ultra-Orthodox group gave him as a present.</p> \n<p>But even if we assume that Friedman identified with the ideas expressed in the photograph, what’s wrong with that? It’s an image that is familiar to millions of Jews around the world who consider it totally legitimate. After all, every observant Jew prays three times a day “May our eyes behold Your return to Zion in mercy.” Clearly Friedman, who comes to the Western Wall regularly to pray, hopes, like any religious Jew, that full redemption will come and the Temple will soon be rebuilt. The ambassador shouldn’t be ashamed of his faith and his lifestyle just because a few liberals speaking for themselves don’t like it.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, Alpher is angered by the fact that the government of the United States has changed and instead of a Democratic president who thinks like they do, speaks their language and fulfills their worldview, in the White House now sits a president and a diplomatic staff who seek to implement a conservative ideology.</p> \n<p>Not for nothing have all the Reform rabbis and Democratic politicians who were at home with government leaders been shunted aside. They have been replaced by Orthodox rabbis, Republican Jewish kippa-wearing activists and even the ultra-Orthodox. Those who have lost their hold on the centers of power find it hard to accept that fact.</p> \n<p>The Israeli left and Alpher as their main mouthpiece cannot come to terms with the fact that Trump is now president, just as they cannot come to terms with the success of Netanyahu and his team, especially with the successful cooperation between them. </p> \n<p>Friedman has chalked up many successes during his term. He has launched historic processes. He led the U.S. Embassy to move to Jerusalem, worked for recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and has been revealed as greatly sympathetic to Israel. So yes, we have an ambassador who is both a proud Jew and a proud American and does it in his own way, without shame and without obsequiousness. </p> \n<p>The time has come for the left to understand that it might also respect positions and ideologies that are different from its own. Instead of besmirching and complaining, it might be expected that Alpher try to understand and respect those who are different from him.</p> \n<p>The time has also come to give credit to Friedman for his great success, which is actually the success of the Jewish state. His victory is a victory for all of us.</p>",

        "text":["<p>An archaeologist who opposes expanding the mixed-gender prayer space at the Western Wall petitioned the High Court of Justice on Monday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assumption of the chairmanship of the committee handling the issue.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The committee’s original chairperson, Culture Minister Miri Regev, resigned last week because she said her “conscience wouldn’t allow her” to approve the expansion. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, also on the three-member panel, subsequently resigned as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since Netanyahu favors the expansion, his assumption of the chairmanship is widely expected to facilitate the plan’s approval. Prof. Dan Bahat, the man who excavated the Western Wall tunnels and formerly served as the Israel Antiquities Authority’s chief archaeologist for the Jerusalem District, opposes widening the mixed-gender prayer space near Robinson’s Arch because he says it would cause irreversible damage to the important archaeological site.</p> \n<p>The petition objects to Netanyahu chairing the committee mainly on procedural grounds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Under the law, the prime minister can assume the chairmanship of any committee set up by the cabinet. But this committee, the petition argues, is a statutory panel created by the Antiquities Law. Therefore, it’s an independent panel rather than a cabinet committee, so the prime minister can’t replace the culture minister as its chair.</p> \n<p>“The government tried to change the committee’s composition in order to crudely intervene in its expected decision and change the outcome of the vote,” the petition charges, referring to how the original committee lacked a majority behind the proposed expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Through the decades of the committee’s existence, there has never been any intervention in its composition or in the authority of the ministers on it, and never has a minister been denied authority solely in order to reach a specific result,” it adds.</p> \n<p>The petition is expected to accelerate Netanyahu’s efforts to push the expansion through the committee, for fear that otherwise, the High Court might order the government to allow mixed-gender prayer at the main Western Wall Plaza, which is currently divided into men’s and women’s sections. That would almost certainly spark a crisis with the ultra-Orthodox parties who are part of Netanyahu’s governing coalition.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Birthright Israel has done its best to stay above the political fray ever since its founding in 1999. Like most major institutions, though, in these divisive times it is losing the struggle to remain detached from deep political differences. Over the past months, it has been targeted directly by young activist Jews, angry over what they believe is the program’s refusal to deliver a balanced message to its participants regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>The activities have ranged from protests against the Birthright gala in New York, to leafleting Birthright participants boarding their flights to Israel, to the high-profile walkout of five female participants toward the end their trip to Israel last Thursday, opting instead to join a Breaking the Silence tour in Hebron.</p> \n<p>This last event kicked off what the activist group IfNotNow predicts will be a long, hot summer against the program.</p> \n<p>The original goals of those who conceived and founded the program were indeed apolitical. If anything, the founders themselves leaned to the left of the political spectrum. It was Yossi Beilin, the father of the Oslo Accords, who first proposed giving every young Jewish person a voucher for a free trip to Israel, convincing major donors Michael Steinhardt and Charles Bronfman to team up with him.</p> \n<p>Their vision: An Israel-Diaspora financial partnership to subsidize free trips for young American Jews, particularly those who had never been to Israel and whose connection with Judaism might be tenuous, offering them an intensive, 10-day personal experience to get in touch with their Jewishness. Branded as Taglit in Israel – the Hebrew word for discovery – the aim was to give participants a way to connect to Jewish culture and history.</p> \n<p>Back then, Israel was presented as a means to the goal of strengthening Jewish identity – the trip was not intended to center on the Jewish state. At the time, American-Jewish leaders were wringing their hands about “Jewish continuity”: Studies pointed to a meaningful personal experience in Israel among a group of young Jewish peers acting as something of a magic pill against total assimilation – or, at least, a seed that later in life could develop and grow into a connection to the Jewish community. (A rather unsubtle and offensive sub-agenda: Birthright as a speed-dating, matchmaking service in which Holy Land hookups could turn into Jewish weddings, resulting in new generations of identified North American Jews.)</p> \n<p>Attempts to politicize Birthright “aren’t something new,” Beilin told Haaretz on Sunday. “Throughout the years, there has been criticism from leftist groups that say people who come on Birthright don’t see the whole picture, and it is kind of a hasbara [propaganda] manipulation.”</p> \n<p>Beilin stands firm on his concept. “I did not invent this idea to introduce young Jews to the Middle East conflict. I would like to see them learn more about it, and those who want to stay after their time in Taglit should do so – many do. Some are spending time in the West Bank and learning about the conflict, about the viewpoint of the Palestinians, though while in Israel they hear from both right and left.”</p> \n<p>Last year, Bronfman and Steinhardt declared in a Haaretz Op-Ed that they were proud the organization’s guiding “core principles” had helped it survive “the second intifada, or an Israeli government cut of 90 percent in one year, or active opposition to the very concept of Birthright on some campuses.”</p> \n<p>But Birthright is having a harder time surviving the generosity of billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who came on board in 2007. This April, the casino magnate gave the organization $70 million to mark the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel – the largest single donation to the program ever, bring his total donations to it into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p> \n<p>Adelson has denied having any involvement in Birthright’s programing decisions. And Beilin insists that “the fact Sheldon Adelson contributes a significant amount of money doesn’t mean he has anything to say about the content.”</p> \n<p>But regardless, Adelson’s money and his presence at events like the program’s mega-event has, justified or not, created a connection between his hard-line, right-wing Israel agenda and – even more disturbing for young American Jews – his tremendous financial and political support of President Donald Trump, which has tainted the organization for many.</p> \n<p>Additionally, there has been some evidence suggesting that the orientation of the trips’ contents could be related to his influence.</p> \n<p>Last November, it was revealed that Birthright’s education department had instructed its trip providers to stop including meetings with Israeli Arabs on itineraries. Two years prior, Birthright had launched a new program aimed at fostering connections with Israeli Arabs, following criticism for not including meetings with non-Jews on its trips and for providing participants with a largely one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>The organization claimed last year that the meetings had been suspended as a result of “a need for further analysis of this module in the context of the educational trip as a whole.”</p> \n<p>One Palestinian who had spoken to Birthright groups wrote in Haaretz that following the move, “Birthright is going to be exactly what it’s always been expected to be – a sterile utopia that reflects the reality in Israel-Palestine even less than it used to.”</p> \n<p>Also in November 2017, the Reform Movement was notified that it had been dropped as a certified trip provider for Birthright, despite having served in this capacity since the program’s launch. Reform leaders were told they were ineligible because they failed to meet participant quotas, not because Birthright had anything against progressive and pluralistic Judaism.</p> \n<p>Still, it pointed to a growing trend of Orthodox dominance in the Birthright market, as a result of consolidation. In its early years, Birthright worked with 33 trip providers. The list was consolidated over the years and now totals only 10, three of which are Orthodox organizations: Mayanot, affiliated with Chabad and the group leading the tour that the five young women walked out of last week; Israel Free Spirit, affiliated with the Orthodox Union, Aish Hatorah and Meor; and Ezra World, affiliated with the Orthodox Ezra youth movement.</p> \n<p>Agitation against Birthright by the pro-BDS, hard-left group Jewish Voice for Peace began last September, when young activists published a manifesto declaring, “We implore other young Jews on our campuses and in our communities: Don’t go on a Birthright trip to Israel. Don’t take a trip sponsored by conservative donors and the Israeli government, where the ongoing oppression and occupation of Palestinians will be hidden from you, just because it’s free. There are other ways for us to strengthen our Jewish identities, in community with those who share our values. Israel is not our Birthright.”</p> \n<p>Alongside the manifesto was a pledge for young Jews to sign, in which they declared: “We will not go on a Birthright trip because it is fundamentally unjust that we are given a free trip to Israel, while Palestinian refugees are barred from returning to their homes.”</p> \n<p>The IfNotNow campaign debuting this summer falls short of JVP’s call for young Jews to boycott Birthright. Rather, it charges that Birthright fails to tell Israel’s story accurately and must be pressured to do so. Birthrighters, it says in its #NotJustA FreeTrip video, must “challenge Taglit-Birthright trips until they show us the reality of the occupation.”</p> \n<p>That is what last week’s walkout was designed to illustrate.</p> \n<p>Beilin believes the young protesters were unfair on Birthright. “They are coming to a store and asking for merchandise that exists in another store. I never asked them to become our ambassadors and deal with hasbara. For me, what happens on the bus is more important than what they hear at Masada. This is a Jewish trip that the Jewish people are paying for.”</p> \n<p>He said IfNotNow members who walked out, in what appeared to be a pre-planned action, should have completed their Birthright trip and then joined a Breaking the Silence tour later.</p> \n<p>“For me, Breaking the Silence is doing a sacred job and they are real Zionists and we owe them much for their courage. But this doesn’t mean I would like to praise this kind of a game [that the women played]. Because it is not honest.”</p> \n<p>As Prof. Steven M. Cohen sees it, “The current situation is more driven by context than by personalities or Birthright’s educational procedures.”</p> \n<p>Cohen, one of the preeminent experts on the American-Jewish community, believes that, given the current circumstances, “Birthright is navigating these difficult times extraordinarily well.</p> \n<p>“Never have American Jews been so polarized around religion, politics and Israel,” he says. “We have confrontations between people who are religious and those who are relatively secular, conservatives against liberals, and hawks against doves.”</p> \n<p>In this context, the fact that Birthright connects Adelson – a conservative, Republican, Trump donor and a hawk on Israeli politics – with young Jews in IfNotNow who are politically progressive and dovish on Israel was a collision waiting to happen.</p> \n<p>“We had a situation ready for conflict, and that is what we are seeing right now,” notes Cohen. “In retrospect, there is little that Birthright could have done, or can do, to avoid demonstrations and protests – either now or in the future. If anything is to blame, it is Israel’s hawkish policies and American Jews’ liberal politics.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel’s preeminent Holocaust historian, Yehuda Bauer, has castigated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his recent joint statement with Poland, which, Bauer said, belittles the Polish role in the destruction of Polish Jewry. “This is a small achievement and a big mistake, which borders on betrayal,” Bauer said of Netanyahu’s blessing for the Polish amendment that would decriminalize claims that Poles aided and abetted the Nazis, but maintain their status as a civil offense.</p> \n<p>It’s tempting to excuse the incident as a triumph of realpolitik over historical truth. Israel, after all, has myriad political and security interests with Poland that are arguably more important than the age-old question of the complicity of Poles in the Holocaust. Yedioth Ahronot columnist Nahum Barnea, for example, this week compared Netanyahu’s move to Ben Gurion’s willingness in the early 1950’s to recognize an “other Germany” in exchange for massive German aid. “There were those who cursed him for this; others blessed him. In hindsight, it seems like he was right.”</p> \n<p>The comparison, of course, is problematic, and not just in scale. Israel in the early 1950’s was desperate. It suffered from extreme austerity, was strapped for cash and faced the impossible hurdle of absorbing masses of new immigrants that doubled the country’s population within the first four years of its existence. Germany’s decision to grant Israel close to $8 billion dollars in current value literally saved the Israeli economy from going bankrupt. Israel’s reliance on Poland in 2018 is negligible in comparison to say the least.</p> \n<p>Contrary to Polish leaders, moreover, who cater to nationalist sentiments by legislating revisionist history, German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer defied them in 1952 by accepting responsibility for the Holocaust as crimes committed “on behalf of the German people.” Ironically, Netanyahu’s ideological predecessor Menachem Begin was the fiercest opponent of the so-called reparations deal with Germany, leading a popular revolt that bordered at times on mutiny.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Netanyahu’s willingness to forgive, forget and look the other way when Holocaust revisionism and plain anti-Semitism rear their heads isn’t limited to Poland. His chummy relationship with Hungarian authoritarian Viktor Orban is another case in point. Netanyahu visited Budapest last July and extolled Orban’s leadership, despite the Hungarian prime minister’s effusive praise for Hungary’s World War II dictator Miklos Horthy, who was “complicit” in the extermination of Hungary’s Jews, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Netanyahu was also one of a handful of Western leaders who called Orban to congratulate him after his victory in this year’s April elections, despite the fact that the win was based on a virulent public campaign against George Soros, which Hungarian Jews and international observers described as anti-Semitic in tone and content.</p> \n<p>This week it was announced that Orban would visit Israel on July 18-20, thus completing Netanyahu’s efforts to stamp the Hungarian leader with an Israeli kosher certificate. The Hungarian leader will be given a royal welcome, but in light of Netanyahu’s own incessant attacks on Soros, for all we know the two leaders might issue a joint statement condemning the Hungarian-born Jewish financier. This is less Ben Gurion style realpolitik and more an Israeli prime minister’s active collaboration in anti-Jewish propaganda.</p> \n<p>The Netanyahu-Orban axis, after all, isn’t a product of tactical political expediency, but a strategic meeting of the minds. Both strive for ethnocentric illiberalism. Both share a disdain for liberal values, especially those admired and cultivated by the vast majority of American Jews. Both agitate against immigrants. Both are sworn enemies of the free press. Both feel an affinity with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin and both have tied their country’s fates to Donald Trump. Needless to say, Netanyahu has pointedly refrained from criticizing Trump for any of his questionable statements on racists and Jews, including his post-Charlottesville equation of neo-Nazis with anti-racist demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s courtship of authoritarian regimes can be explained, but not justified. Of course he revels in Trump’s revocation of the Iran nuclear deal and his anti-Palestinian policies, including the transfer of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. And naturally Netanyahu is eager to exploit the willingness of countries such as Hungary and Poland to buck the European Union, a pet peeve of the prime minister and the U.S. President, and to undermine Europe’s criticism of Israeli policies in the occupied territories.</p> \n<p>But such considerations cannot excuse Netanyahu’s willingness to turn a blind eye to Holocaust revisionism and anti-Semitism. They cannot serve as a pretext for turning his back on the painful legacy of Polish and Hungarian Jews or for alienating the vibrant American Jewish community. His decision to gloss over the odious Polish law against claims of Polish complicity in the Holocaust and to camouflage Hungary’s propaganda against “internationalists” like Soros are a blot on his own record and a stain on Israeli history. Netanyahu’s whitewashing of anti-Jewish regimes may not be tantamount to “selling the memory of slaughtered Jews for blood money”, as Begin said of Ben Gurion, but one thing is certain: the legendary Herut founder would be ashamed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ready or not, change is coming to the House Democrats.</p> \n<p>Across the country, a new generation is making its way to Washington. It’s not just that some of the Democrats, like 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are young and progressive. They are. Or that many are women entering politics who want to fight President Donald Trump. They do. Or even that some of them live in Trump country.</p> \n<p>They also come to politics steeped in an era of resistance and revolt, like the tea party Republicans who rose against President Barack Obama and the so-called Watergate babies elected after President Richard Nixon.</p> \n<p>If the newcomers provide the numbers to give Democrats control of the House, or even fall short and end up in the ranks of the minority, they will be a force to be reckoned with upon arrival. That holds especially true for Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the longtime House Democratic leader.</p> \n<p>“There is a hunger for generational change, for a new generation of leadership,” said freshman Rep. Ro Khanna of California. “I think we’re going to see some of the most impressive young people being elected across the country, and it’s going to be, in my view, an extraordinary class, like the Watergate Class.”</p> \n<p>Last Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez pulled off a stunning primary election romp in New York, toppling 10-term congressman Joe Crowley of Queens. He was once thought of as a possible successor to Pelosi, but has now become a symbol of how the party is being transformed in the Trump era.</p> \n<p>The defeat of Crowley, the Democratic caucus chairman, opens up the fourth spot on the leadership rung. A robust contest is expected to replace him, but the leadership changes may not stop there.</p> \n<p>Several Democratic candidates for Congress have said they would not support Pelosi as leader. And even some of those Democrats who want Pelosi to reclaim the speaker’s gavel, if Democrats retake the majority, have made clear that new approaches are needed.</p> \n<p>“I think there was a lack of listening on the ground, a lack of going to the grocery store and saying, ’Hey, how are you doing?’” Ocasio-Cortez said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” She pointed to a Democratic Party at risk of becoming out of touch with its communities. “The messaging isn’t as clear to the communities that we are trying to represent — are we fighting or not?”</p> \n<p>Ocasio-Cortez, who says being a Democratic socialist is “a part of what I am, it’s not all of what I am” — declined to say whether she would support Pelosi as House leader, calling any decision now “premature.”</p> \n<p>There remains no obvious replacement for Pelosi or the second-ranking Democrat, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, so many aren’t convinced there will be an immediate leadership shuffle after the election. But in the next few years, even newcomers “like Alexandria could be there,” said Khanna, who backed both Ocasio-Cortez and Crowley in the race. “The traditional rules of politics don’t apply.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi has shown no signs of loosening her hold on leadership, however.</p> \n<p>“We just want to win,” she told reporters this week. She recalled the questions she heard after the Women’s March in 2017, when people would ask how Democrats were going to use all of that energy. She said she told them, “It’s not a question of how we will use it. It’s a question about how they will use us.”</p> \n<p>She added last week: “Everything is at stake in our country. People all see the urgency of it, they want to take responsibility for it. That gives us an opportunity to win.”</p> \n<p>“So I just say, ‘Just win, baby,’” she said.</p> \n<p>Two-term Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, an Iraq War combat Marine, is not one to discount the staying power of Pelosi and the other top leaders. But he is certain they will be tested by the new arrivals.</p> \n<p>“Whoever the leaders are of this caucus, are going to have to be accountable to this new caucus that’s going in,” he said. “They’re going to have to come to caucus and give arguments — why they are in leadership and why they should stay in leadership.”</p> \n<p>One traditional factor in leadership races has been fundraising. Pelosi has been the party’s top fundraiser, and Crowley has long been skilled at bringing donors to the table. But the younger generation of Democrats doesn’t value fundraising the way leaders do. At a time when candidates like Ocasio-Cortez can win a primary with a big social media presence and small-dollar donations, they don’t need to cozy up to the party power structure.</p> \n<p>As far as traditional arguments to win leadership races, “that’s not going to fly with these incoming members of Congress,” Gallego said.</p> \n<p>Other competing factors will be at play when House Democrats decide their leadership slate, including ideology and geography.</p> \n<p>Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said Democrats need “to make sure progressives are represented in leadership.” The primary elections are showing that “bold progressive messages work, and we’re hoping leadership will take that to heart,” he said.</p> \n<p>Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, one of a dozen Democrats who represent districts that Trump won in the 2016 election, said it’s the corners of the country like her Midwestern stronghold that should have more voice in leadership. She wants the caucus to reflect the nation’s geographic diversity.</p> \n<p>“Where we need more Democrats is in these districts that are a little tougher to navigate,” Bustos said. “And I think it’s very important that we don’t lose sight of that.”</p> \n<p>As the top Democrat on the rules committee, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts said he would like to loosen the process to give more rank-and-file lawmakers a chance to propose amendments. That would allow them to bring their ideas to the table.</p> \n<p>McGovern said it recently took him two hours to shop for groceries back home because so many constituents stopped to talk with him. Voters, he said, want Democrats “to stand up to Trump’s racism and his bigotry and all his hateful policies.” But they also want them to make strides on Democratic priorities, he said.</p> \n<p>“What people are looking for is not just for us to be right on the issues,” he said. “They want to know what we’re going to do to fight for these issues.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Every visitor entering Polin, Warsaw’s Museum of the History of Polish Jews, has to pass through a symbolic ancient forest. This forest represents early medieval Poland: the cradle of the Polish nation-state, which has been populated by Slavic tribes, Celts, Germans, Baltic peoples, Jews and many others.</p> \n<p>In Poland, as elsewhere, the idea of a unified nation is a recent construct. The ethnic composition of the Polish modern nation included Germans, Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Armenians, Muslim Tatars and many other groups. For centuries, Polish noblemen did not consider peasants to be members of the same nation – and even in the early 20th century many Polish peasants did not declare any national identity.</p> \n<p>This complexity is worth mentioning in the context of the recent Haaretz opinion piece, Jews Should Be More Sensitive to Polish Feelings When They Talk About Holocaust-era Poland by Mr Andrzej Pawluszek, an adviser to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.</p> \n<p>In his piece, Pawluszek presented the problem of anti-Semitism in Poland and the commemoration of Jewish history as an international affair. The opposition between &quot;we&quot; (ethnic Poles) and &quot;they&quot; (Jews represented by Israel) in Pawluszek’s article is striking.</p> \n<p>I cannot imagine any other representative of a democratic country – be it France, Britain, Canada or the U.S. – who would discuss the problem of the safety of his Jewish compatriots or commemoration of Jewish history as an international rather than internal, domestic issue.</p> \n<p>Pawluszek is hardly alone in using language denoting Jews as 'outsiders.' The denial of Jewish indigeneity in Poland is visible in common Polish discourses about being a &quot;hospitable country&quot; or &quot;1000 years of Polish tolerance.&quot;</p> \n<p>Such views assume that the Christian population of Poland was the &quot;host,&quot; whereas Jews are often presented as &quot;guests.&quot; It excludes the fundamental contribution of Jews to Polish national culture – a contribution not less fundamental than the one of Polish peasants, noblemen or German burghers.</p> \n<p>Psychological studies undertaken in many countries show that claims of autochthony – a belief that one’s country or state eternally belongs to one’s own ethnic group – brings not only the sense of entitlement, but also prejudice and willingness to censor other voices on history. This is true both among Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem’s Silwan, as well as in contemporary Eastern Europe: Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia.</p> \n<p>Those Polish politicians who subjectively exclude Jews from Polish national identity seem to be completely blind to both the current and historical problems of their Jewish compatriots. They become somebody else’s problems. Many instances of that can be seen in Pawluszek’s article.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the clearest, egregious example of this is his discussion of contemporary anti-Semitism in Poland.</p> \n<p>In early 2018, in the middle of a heated debate about the Holocaust bill then approved by the Polish parliament, Jewish communities in Poland faced a wave of hate, from threatening phone calls and emails to a range of other forms of harassment. For many years Jews were the most frequent targets of hate crimes in Poland – being replaced by Muslims only after the anti-immigrant campaign of 2015.</p> \n<p>But Mr Pawluszek declares that &quot;only&quot; 100 hate crimes against Jews were reported in 2016. Conveniently for his thesis that anti-Semitism is in rapid decline in Poland, the report he cited does not include the statistics for the anti-Semitism wave following his government's Holocaust legislation, nor does he put Poland’s tiny Jewish population of less than 10,000 in context when he compares it with the anti-Semitism in European states with far larger Jewish communities.</p> \n<p>Indeed, by 2017 the numbers rose to 112 anti-Semitic hate crimes against Jews in Poland. That means last year more than one in 100 Polish Jews experienced such an assault. Instead of considering this number alarming, Mr Pawluszek tries to build advantageous comparisons with the UK (where a corresponding 1 in 200 Jews would experience an anti-Semitic hate crime) or France (less than 1 in 1000). Objective numbers are clearly misleading if one does not take the Jewish community size into account.</p> \n<p>Mr Pawluszek also claims that &quot;safe haven&quot; Poland is the safest country for Jews in today’s Europe. Not only is that demonstrably untrue, but it carries the unmistakable denialist and Islamophobic undertone of Europe’s nationalists: that all anti-Semitic incidents in Europe are linked to Muslims. In fact, even in the countries with large Muslim presence, the far right is still the major threat to Jewish communities. For example, in Germany about 90% of anti-Semitic hate crimes reported in 2017 were caused by right-wing extremists.</p> \n<p>In Poland, since the democratic transition of 1989, anti-Semitic hatred has become far more widespread, whether it’s online, on state-owned television, on Catholic radio stations, in mainstream newspapers, and even in graffiti on many buildings in L&oacute;dz and Krak&oacute;w. Many Jewish cemeteries and Holocaust memorials have also been vandalized.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our own research, conducted in 2014, showed that more than 58% of Polish adolescents had daily contact with anti-Semitic contents on the Internet; by 2016 that figure had risen to 74%. Almost 40% of Polish adults surveyed in 2016 stated they regularly heard anti-Semitic comments on local TV (a rise from 25% in 2014).</p> \n<p>At the same time, there is a striking prevalence of anti-Semitic stereotypes: almost half of Poles surveyed in 2017 believe that &quot;Jews often act in a secret, malevolent way,&quot; and blame Jews themselves for the belief that Poles are anti-Semitic. One in four Poles blame the Jews of today for killing Jesus. These numbers show no sign at all of decreasing over time.</p> \n<p>Living in a hateful environment is clearly detrimental to the psychological well-being of minorities; it is a known trigger for depression and is also a factor in increased numbers of suicides. It is, therefore, hard to understand why a high-ranking Polish policy maker would so explicitly ignore the objective growth in anti-Semitism in Poland and trivialize anti-Jewish hate crimes.</p> \n<p>This same thread is also evident when Mr. Pawluszyk discusses Poland’s Holocaust bill, whose clauses criminalized the act of accusing the Polish nation of responsibility for the Holocaust. His boss, the Polish prime minister, recently asked Polish lawmakers to amend the law and the Parliament voted to remove criminal penalties for accusing Poland of complicity in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Holocaust bill was not intended to criminalize the use of the term &quot;Polish death camp&quot; (as Mr Pawluszyk erroneously suggests). The obvious goal of the legislators was to construct a censorship law; many of them referred to this law as &quot;Lex Gross&quot; – that its intention was to silence Polish historians writing about the complexity of Polish-Jewish history, such as Jan Tomasz Gross.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Recently, the Center for Research on Prejudice at the University of Warsaw studied the consequences of the January 2018 Holocaust bill. After its introduction, anti-Semitic content on social media in Poland spiked rapidly. The bill, ironically, failed to fight the historical fallacies that the government - at least, rhetorically - most wanted to confront. After Poland introduced the Holocaust law, the term &quot;Polish death camps&quot; became one of the most commonly searched phrases on Google, not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Australia, Britain and the U.S.</p> \n<p>After January 2018, the language of the Holocaust debate in Poland became highly polarized, into &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; Poles: surveys show that Poles want to know more about Polish crimes against Jews during WWII, as well as about heroic Polish acts of rescue.</p> \n<p>But Poles today seem to forget that the most common reaction of bystanders to racism and atrocities is passivity – and acts of extreme morality or immorality are relatively rare. There are no nations composed only of heroes and villains. However, the overwhelming passivity of Polish bystanders during the Holocaust is missing from the public speeches of Poland’s prime minister, its president, as well as from Mr. Pawluszek’s article.</p> \n<p>Historical negation is quite common in today’s Poland. Mr Pawluszek mentioned the fact that the Institute of National Remembrance has investigated the cases of Jews murdered by Poles. It is worth mentioning, that under the current Polish government, that same Institute is a stronghold of historical denialism. The new Institute’s director, Dr. Jarosaw Szarek, testified in parliament that the massacre of Jews by Poles in Jedwabne was not only instigated, but also perpetrated by Nazi Germans. Similarly, the Polish education minister has expressed doubt that Poles participated in the pogrom.</p> \n<p>The historian responsible for the Jedwabne investigation in which Pawluszek takes such pride, Dr. Krzysztof Persak, was fired from the Institute of National Remembrance straight after a new director was put in place. That signified its transformation into an institute of denial, nationalism and historical censorship. Today, it presents Polish history only through the lens of Christians and ethnic Poles; other elements of Polish national heritage are effectively excluded.</p> \n<p>The tendency to represent the Polish nation solely through its Christian citizens is visible in Poland not only among the Holocaust denialists and nationalists. It is also apparent even in the language of well-intentioned statesmen, who apologized for the pogroms in Jedwabne or Kielce in the name of &quot;Poland&quot; – meaning Polish Christians, erasing the fact that the victims were themselves Polish citizens, no less than those who murdered them.</p> \n<p>The only real way for Poland to reconcile with its history is to stop excluding the minorities who have always been part of Poland - Jews, Byelorussians and Ukrainians - from Polishness. As Poland today becomes again an ethnically diverse country, having recently absorbed more than a million Ukrainian immigrants, a broader understanding of what it means to be a Pole is badly, belatedly, needed.</p> \n<p>Hopefully, the next generations of Polish politicians will also understand – in line with Poland’s constitution &nbsp;itself – that they are required to represent our whole nation, rather than a single ethno-religious group, and to represent its entire historical legacy.</p> \n<p>Michal Bilewicz – associate professor of social psychology and the director of the Center for Research on Prejudice at the University of Warsaw.

So here's this:</p> \n<p>We in Israel need to seriously address the history, the consequences, and, yes, the heritage, of our own terrorism.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago outside a courtroom in the mixed Jewish-Arab town of Lod, some 20 young Jews danced and chanted in celebration of the grisly 2015 fire-bombing murder of an 18-month-old Palestinian baby, Ali Dawabshe, killed in his bed in the West Bank village of Duma.</p> \n<p>Ali's parents were also killed in the attack, and his four-year-old brother Ahmed was critically burned.</p> \n<p>The celebrants, wearing the outsize skullcaps and long forelocks favored by militant &quot;price-tag&quot; settlers, surrounded Ali and Ahmed's grandfather Hussein Dawabshe as he left the court where the three Jewish murder suspects were on trial.</p> \n<p>&quot;Where is Ali? Dead! Burned! There is no Ali!&quot; they jeered at the grandfather, who has raised the four-year-old Ahmed and seen him through the grueling healing process since the attack. &quot;Ali is on fire! Ali is on the grill!&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Police officers and the ministers who were present at the court chose not to intervene,&quot; Ynet reported at the time, &quot;letting the demonstration of hatred and racism continue.&quot; The Israel Police&nbsp;were later quoted as explaining that officers did not intervene because &quot;There was no violent rioting.&quot;</p> \n<p>Apart from the question of how the police would have reacted had the demonstrators been Palestinians and the victim a Jewish child – recent experience leaves little doubt that the result would have been beatings, injuries and arrests – it is worth paying attention to the response of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet, who are consistent and immediate in strafing social media after every event involving Palestinian terrorism:</p> \n<p>Silence.</p> \n<p>There it is. Israel has a terrorism problem which has been part and parcel of Zionism even before the state was founded. It's there every time Benjamin Netanyahu waxes moral, declaring that the Palestinians erect monuments to their terrorists, while we build tributes to peace.</p> \n<p>Consider, as but one example of thousands, Netanyahu's meticulously produced video statement with which he opened this school year, excoriating Palestinians for building monuments to honor terrorists who killed Jews.</p> \n<p>&quot;Children should be taught to love and respect, not hate and kill,&quot; Netanyahu intones, his palms clasped in sincerity.</p> \n<p>&quot;There are so many champions of peace to dedicate statues to. Why do the Palestinians consistently choose to honor mass murderers?&quot;</p> \n<p>What Netanyahu did not say, was that entire Birthright trips could be built around the plaques and monuments which Israel has erected in recent years to honor the bombings and other terrorist killings committed by the members of the Irgun Zvai Leumi and Lehi pre-state underground groups – not to mention the highways, boulevards, schools, and town squares named for the armed bands' respective commanders in chief – the late Israeli prime ministers Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir.</p> \n<p>There is also the gravesite and pilgrimage site in the West Bank settler city of Kiryat Arba, honoring the memory of Baruch Goldstein, who close to the Purim festival in 1994 gunned down 29 Palestinians kneeling during worship at Hebron's Tomb of the Patriarchs.</p> \n<p>As recently as 2010, Jewish residents of East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood were filmed celebrating Purim by singing &quot;Dr. Goldstein, there is none other like you in the world. Dr. Goldstein, we all love you he aimed at terrorists' heads, squeezed the trigger hard, and shot bullets, and shot, and shot.&quot;</p> \n<p>Our terrorism problem has grown so cosmeticized as to have become all but invisible. Hidden in plain sight.</p> \n<p>It was there at the opening of the landmark official visit of Britain's Prince William. It was there in the breezy dispatch of Israel 10 Television News correspondent Akiva Novick, who reported, in a reference to former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin's Irgun Zvai Leumi armed underground:</p> \n<p>&quot;For the first time ever, an official visit of a member of the Royal Family, and in the place blown up 72 years ago by IZL men in one of the operations which brought about the end of the British mandatory rule here.</p> \n<p>&quot;It took very many years for the British to restrain themselves, or to have absorbed this insult.&quot;</p> \n<p>This insult.</p> \n<p>&quot;The terror attack on the King David Hotel in Jerusalem was in its day the equivalent of the Twin Towers,&quot; wrote historian Tom Segev in 2006, after Benjamin Netanyahu had taken center stage at a commemoration celebrating the 60th anniversary of the attack. Years later, Segev would call it, &quot;at the time the most lethal terrorist attack in history.&quot;</p> \n<p>The blast, which levelled six floors of a wing of the hotel with 350 kilograms of explosive, killed 91 people, all but 16 of them civilians. Most of the dead were British government staffers or hotel employees. There were 41 Arabs, 28 British citizens, 17&nbsp;Jews, two Armenians, one Russian, one Greek and one Egyptian.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the two-day 60th anniversary event at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center, Netanyahu joined IZL veterans and academics who sought to prove, once and for all, that the bombers and gunmen of Begin's IZL and of future prime minister Yitzhak Shamir's radical Lehi underground – which carried out high-level political assassinations - had been freedom fighters and not terrorists.</p> \n<p>They insisted that the occupants of the King David had been given fair warning, a claim disputed by British authorities.</p> \n<p>They spoke of the bombing as the most significant event in driving the British out of Palestine and paving the way for Israel's independence, a claim widely disputed by historians but significant in its subtext – that terrorism, in the end, pays.</p> \n<p>The climax of the 60th anniversary observance was the unveiling of a large plaque near the King David, commemorating the bombing.</p> \n<p>At the time, Simon Macdonald, the British ambassador to Israel, along with consul general John Jenkins, wrote to the mayor of Jerusalem protesting the plaque. &quot;We don't think it's right for an act of terrorism to be commemorated,&quot; they wrote. The British embassy added that: &quot;There is no credible evidence that any warning reached the British authorities.&quot;</p> \n<p>The text of the plaque was altered slightly, but the monument remained.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, meanwhile, who had just suffered a crushing defeat in the 2006 elections, his Likud coming in a dismal fourth with only 12 Knesset seats and less than nine percent of the vote, was readying a comeback.</p> \n<p>Among the cornerstones of his campaign would be – and is to this day – his condemnation of the Palestinians for honoring terrorists. Still, the reminders of Jewish terrorism continue to present themselves. As the UK Jewish Chronicle wrote in 2016 in a reference to the highest-ranking Jewish victim of the King David bombing, the Manchester man who served as under-secretary of the Palestine treasury:</p> \n<p>&quot;History's joke is that Julius Jacobs's house in Jerusalem became the prime minister's official residence for two decades. Its last occupant was Yitzhak Rabin, who then moved to the new residence on Smolenskin Street. Mr. Begin, the succeeding prime minister, was thus saved from having to confront the ghosts of the past each day and to be reminded of a British Jew who had died unnecessarily in such tragic circumstances.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, under pressure from a foreign state, has backed off the law which his parliament and president had approved.</p> \n<p>What political price he and his party might pay for this from their rightist and nationalist constituents is not known.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave Poland a real treasure in return – recognition of Poland’s narrative on World War II. The joint declaration, which (for good reason) the two leaders read in English rather than in their voters’ languages, made it clear that Warsaw has scored a real victory in the battle for the historical narrative.</p> \n<p>Israel has acknowledged that the Polish nation and state, as a whole, were not involved in the Holocaust and did not collaborate with the Nazis.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Adviser to Polish PM: Jews should be more sensitive to Polish feelings when they talk about Holocaust-era Poland&nbsp;■&nbsp;&gt;&gt; 'Orgy of murder': The Poles who 'hunted' Jews and turned them over to the Nazis</p> \n<p>It also recognized that the Polish government in exile and the Polish underground acted to rescue Jews. In addition, it appreciates and respects the action of “many Poles” who saved Jews, including, of course, about 7,000 Polish Righteous Among the Nations. These points are not historically disputed. Israel’s reservation concerning the phrase “Polish extermination camps” is also clear and acceptable.</p> \n<p>The problem begins with the part of the declaration dealing with the most painful, difficult and sensitive issue: the part many Poles played in persecuting, turning in and murdering Jews – before, during and after the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>On this issue, which is at the center of a lively historic debate, Israel has clearly “yielded” to Poland, out of undisclosed diplomatic considerations. We must pay attention in particular to one vague word – “cruelty.” Israel and Poland recognize the “cruelty” that Poles displayed toward Jews – it says, without detailing and expanding on the nature of this cruelty.</p> \n<p>Not a word about burning Jews alive after locking them up in a barn; no mention of “hunting down Jews” in the fields and selling them to the Germans for a beer bottle. Moreover, this is followed by a reservation, saying that the “cruelty” wasn’t linked to the criminals’ Polish origin – or even to their religion or “world view” – but was simply conduct practiced by “certain people” – so the statement said – in various places. In other words, “there are bad people everywhere.”</p> \n<p>It’s true that many nations collaborated with the Nazis, and in contrast to the Polish case, sometimes with their pro-Nazi governments’ encouragement and initiative. But even so, the joint statement lacks an honest reckoning on Poland’s part of the findings arising from numerous historic studies, including those carried out in Poland itself.</p> \n<p>Examining these studies shows that the Polish collaboration with the Nazis was so extensive, under any criterion, that in almost every village, township and city there were Poles who agreed to sell their soul to the devil. It isn’t worthy or respectable to use the word “cruelty” to describe this chapter of history.</p> \n<p>The Catholic Church also played a significant role in this – whether through anti-Semitic incitement or through silence. So the statement that the criminals among the Polish people acted “regardless of their religion” is not accurate, to say the least.</p> \n<p>A certain problem also arises from the peculiar sentence, that alongside the mutual condemnation of “anti-Semitism” both states also denounce “anti-Polish sentiment.” It is not clear from the declaration’s wording what it means. If it means labelling as “anti-Polish” every statement about the Poles’ collaboration with the Nazis – then the similitude to anti-Semitism is extremely discordant. If the intention is something else – it should have been made clear.</p> \n<p>Despite all this, the bottom line is that the joint declaration is welcome and desirable. From now on, the full examination of the Poles’ part in World War II will be carried out by historians, journalists, public figures and politicians – without the threat of imprisonment hovering over them if they express views that are unpleasant to a certain ear.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The ombudsman of the Israel Defense Forces, Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brik, released his 10th and final annual report Monday. It is unsparing in its criticism of the army’s conduct. Large organizations tend to get defensive in the face of harsh assessments, denying some of the claims and accusing external auditors of a lack of comprehension. But the defense minister and the army’s chief of staff would do well to pay close attention to Brik’s comments.</p> \n<p>Brik presented the report to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Monday morning and convened a press conference at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv Monday afternoon. At both events, he devoted much of his speech to an event that shaped his life - the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when he was the commander of a tank company in a reserve battalion. Out of more than 200 combat soldiers, only seven, including Brik, were still standing at the end of the war. Eighty-four were killed and over 100 were wounded. He himself was wounded twice, switched tanks seven times and was awarded a medal of courage.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Hamas seeks a major conflict with Israel, defense officials warn</p> \n<p>That, he said Monday, is what drives him to this day - ensuring that the state and the army don’t repeat the mistakes that led to that tragedy. It’s also something often raised by his critics, who hint that his views are outdated, that he is overly influenced by his war experience and that he judges by standards that are no longer relevant. And when he argues over the number of tanks the army needs, complains about the damage caused by shortening compulsory service - a move the IDF supported - or is shocked that reservists don’t have to clean their own guns after an exercise, one could make the mistake of considering him a fossil.</p> \n<p>But his criticism isn’t based only on his military experience; it’s also based on 10 years of regular visits to army units and unmediated conversations with soldiers who could be his grandchildren. He doesn’t handle individual complaints from soldiers; he actively seeks to identify problems and propose solutions. (Senior officers aren’t crazy about this; they say system-wide conclusions can’t be drawn from individual complaints). Among other things, he has spurred the army to restock its emergency stores and improve service conditions for soldiers stationed at observation posts and Iron Dome anti-missile system teams.</p> \n<p>And much of the criticism he voiced Monday was on target.</p> \n<p>Perhaps his harshest criticism was evident from what he refused to say. Asked about the IDF’s preparedness for war in the Gaza Strip, he noted that there were worse scenarios, such as an escalation that spreads to the West Bank. And then he retreated: “Allow me not to answer you.” His main concern appears to be the level of preparedness and training in the ground forces’ reserve units.</p> \n<p>He also raised other weighty concerns. The army, he said, faces a growing problem of poor discipline and nonfulfillment of orders. It doesn’t have a culture of following up on the implementation of its plans and orders, and sometimes doesn’t maintain the systems it sets up.</p> \n<p>As an example, he cited the restocking of emergency stores after the Second Lebanon War of 2006, at a cost of 2 billion shekels ($550 million). Some of this money went down the drain because the program lapsed a few years later.</p> \n<p>One of Brik’s regular complaints relates to the Gideon multiyear plan, under which the army dismissed more than 5,000 career soldiers. It then took on 1,000 new ones, mainly in technology units such as cyberwarfare and drones. The ordnance and logistics corps are now short hundreds of noncommissioned officers, even as the workload has grown immeasurably. Thus vehicles and guns are being maintained less well, or even neglected — something that evokes bad memories in any veteran of 1973.</p> \n<p>Brik is also concerned over the quality of the career army’s personnel — especially in combat support units, from the medical corps to the ordnance corps, but recently in combat units as well. “People are voting with their feet,” he said. “The people who stay in the service aren’t always the ones we’d want. ... We’re losing good people, including in intelligence and combat units. Officers are willing to sign on as company commanders, but no higher.”</p> \n<p>Young officers have trouble handling their workload, but their commanders tell them they must make do, Brik continued. They also see their battalion commander attending thousands of conferences and meetings instead of training and commanding his battalion, and consequently, “Many say, ‘I’m not willing to stay if it’s like this. I don’t want to be mediocre.’”</p> \n<p>Many of his complaints relate to the army’s organizational culture, and many are shared by reserve officers and other veterans. The army has no management doctrine; each unit and each commander does as he sees fit, Brik said. Most commands are sent by email; subordinates choose which to obey and which to ignore; and commanders have no ability to follow up.</p> \n<p>Moreover, soldiers are buried in their cellphones. Not only does this make meetings and classes less effective, but “soldiers even guard at the border with their phones, and commanders don’t enforce the rules,” he said. “This is also what will happen in wartime, and the result will be that the units’ location will be in the enemy’s hands.”</p> \n<p>Brik painted a gloomy, pessimistic picture. In the coming days, the IDF will submit its responses, some of which will contradict his conclusions. And indeed, it’s impossible to ignore the army’s successes in building and adapting its forces to new challenges, or the operational successes of recent years, both up in the fighting up north and in preventing a new intifada in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Brik’s criticisms deserve public attention, widespread media coverage and, above all, some thought by the General Staff about how to fix the problems his report highlighted.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the joint press conference during Benjamin Netanyahu’s fleeting visit to Berlin three weeks ago, the prime minister warned about Iran’s actions in Syria. One of the implications, he said, could be another wave of Syrian refugees arriving in Europe.</p> \n<p>“And we all know where they will come to,” he added. Standing beside him, Chancellor Angela Merkel looked even more mournful than usual. Netanyahu had hit her weakest spot, and he had learned to do so from his best European friend&nbsp;– who’s due to arrive in Israel next month.</p> \n<p>Over the last few years, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n has been waging a war of attrition against Merkel over Europe’s future. It may sound absurd that a modest-sized country with economic problems is taking on Europe’s superpower. But based on events in recent weeks, Orb&aacute;n looks like he’s winning – mainly thanks to the immigration issue.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; With 'Stop Soros' bill, Hungary just passed a law Stephen Miller can only dream of | Analysis &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>This weekend they were both at the European Union Leaders Summit in Brussels. The desperate attempt to agree on an EU-wide solution to the immigration crisis&nbsp;was at the top of the agenda.</p> \n<p>Orb&aacute;n, arriving in Brussels, was forthright. “The invasion should be stopped,” he said of the refugees at the Continent’s borders, “and to stop the invasion means to have strong border control, and we have that.”</p> \n<p>Merkel, in a speech in Berlin before leaving, sounded almost apologetic. “Our decision to open doors to refugees in 2015 was not unilateral,” she said. “We acted to help Austria and Hungary.” This time, it was Merkel who was in need of help, to save her political career.</p> \n<p>After a nine-hour marathon meeting that went on into the early hours of Friday, Merkel succeeded in cobbling together a compromise of sorts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In an agreement that 16 EU members agreed to sign, they undertook to set up “centers” for immigrants, both in Europe and North Africa, where they would be processed. Those eligible for asylum would be allowed to stay, while the rest would be deported. The member-states also undertook to prevent the emigration of refugees within the EU. Merkel also signed a separate agreement with Greece and Spain, who undertook to receive immigrants that had arrive there first.</p> \n<p>The details are still vague. It was an achievement for Merkel, simply in being able to agree on a policy that encompasses most of the EU. It may also satisfy her political allies at home, who are demanding more control of Germany’s borders. But it was a win for Orb&aacute;n and other countries with anti-immigration governments, as no country will be forced to have an immigration center in its territory against its will.</p> \n<p>Can the agreement be implemented? Will it hold up to pressure when the next wave of immigrants arrive? Orb&aacute;n and his allies are waiting to trip up Merkel at the next sign of trouble.</p> \n<p>Merkel and Orb&aacute;n were both born and raised under communist regimes. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, they both learned the rules of democracy and became all-powerful leaders of their countries.</p> \n<p>This is where the resemblances end. The apolitical Merkel who swiftly reached the leadership of the conservative CDU party is now seen as the last guarantor of the post-Cold War liberal world order. Orb&aacute;n, who burst onto the public scene in Hungary as an anti-communist activist, is the standard-bearer of “illiberal democracy,” a term he invoked in a speech in 2014.</p> \n<p>Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside</p> \n<p>George Soros, the Hungarian-American financier now the most hated man in Orb&aacute;n’s Hungary, said in 2016 that Orb&aacute;n is “challenging Merkel for the leadership of Europe.” According to Soros, the Hungarian prime minister “attacks the values and principles on which the European Union was founded. Orb&aacute;n attacks them from the inside, [Vladimir] Putin from the outside.”</p> \n<p>It was a showdown that Merkel, backed up by Germany’s economic might and a near consensus among EU leaders, was winning. In early 2015, she visited Budapest and forced Orb&aacute;n to cancel a tax his government had levied on German companies. But two weeks later, the Russian president visited Budapest as well, and Merkel should have read the signs. She was about to make a series of decisions that would lead to her current predicament.</p> \n<p>Throughout 2015, she led the EU’s tough line against the cash-strapped Syriza government in Greece. Merkel insisted on severe austerity measures in return for a bailout. She broke Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, despite the referendum in which a large majority of Greek voters rejected the EU’s terms. The price was bolstering her domineering and coercive image, and that of the EU. A year later, things would end very differently in another referendum.</p> \n<p>But before that, Merkel would make another fateful decision&nbsp;– in September 2015, when she decided that Germany would open its borders and welcome the stream of Syrian refugees crossing the Aegean from Turkey to Greece. Despite the Dublin Treaty, which stipulates that refugees will be processed in the EU member state where they first arrive, she agreed to accept the over 1 million refugees who were reaching Greece and from there crossing the Balkans into Hungary and Austria.</p> \n<p>Merkel had sown the seeds of the current crisis and would begin to counter growing opposition from other EU members who were asked to take in a quota of refugees.</p> \n<p>In 2016, in a series of meetings with Britain's then-Prime Minister David Cameron, Merkel refused to grant any concessions on the EU’s freedom-of-movement principle for immigrants. Without her support, Cameron had no chance with the EU, and though he continued to support remaining in the union, immigration was to become a main issue used by Brexit-supporters, motivating 52 percent of British voters to support leaving on June 23.</p> \n<p>Dominoes fall</p> \n<p>Brexit was to be the wind in Donald Trump’s sails, who five months later promised his supporters on Election Day a “Brexit-plus-plus.” With Trump’s surprising election, Merkel had two alternatives. She could swallow her pride and try to embrace the vainglorious president, or stand for her principles. She chose the second option and won glowing headlines as “the new leader of the free world.” But she also began to lose supporters in Europe.</p> \n<p>The three other members of the Visegrad Group – Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia – rallied to Orb&aacute;n, as did Bulgaria and then Austria under its new right-wing-populist government, which has taken a much tougher line on immigration.</p> \n<p>The most damaging blow was to come last month when Italy’s new populist government began blocking boats from Libya carrying immigrants. But the greatest danger lay at home.</p> \n<p>Orb&aacute;n has long been building his relations with the CDU’s sister party, Bavaria’s CSU, and especially its leader, Horst Seehofer. The more conservative and wealthy Bavarians were much less excited by Merkel’s friendly welcome to the refugees thronging in their thousands at Munich’s main train station. Seehofer, who has hosted Orb&aacute;n at CSU meetings where Merkel’s immigration policy has been criticized, is now demanding that Germany block at its borders refugees who have passed through other EU countries.</p> \n<p>Merkel refuses to budge, and this weekend’s summit was her last chance to try to deliver a new EU policy that would not only gain the support of the other member states but also placate the CSU. She was on the brink of losing the party necessary for her tenuous majority in the Bundestag.</p> \n<p>The deal achieved on Friday will probably satisfy the CSU for now. But it may not be enough to deal with much larger numbers of immigrants, if a similar wave to that of 2015 arrives from Syria or North Africa. Orb&aacute;n is lurking.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And now he is not alone; he has a much larger coalition of like-minded governments, including the Trump administration and a growing list of European allies. These new populist leaders see Orb&aacute;n and Netanyahu as their father figures.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Orb&aacute;n has managed to diffuse international condemnation of anti-Semitism by forging a political marriage of convenience with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an equally cynical, ruthless and shrewd operator,” wrote the Hungarian-Jewish journalist, Paul Lendvai, in his recent biography of Orb&aacute;n. “Each side uses the other as a smokescreen to cover up ugly realities and offer pretexts to blunt liberal critics.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In three years, Merkel has gone from leader of Europe to being almost isolated. Even French President Emmanuel Macron, nominally her ally, has been discreetly distancing himself. The photograph of Merkel at last month’s G-7 summit confronting Trump made liberal hearts soar across the Western world. But it also underlined how the West is now divided into two camps. And the Orb&aacute;n-Trump-Netanyahu camp is swiftly gaining ground.</p>",

Saut&eacute; until softened and fragrant, but before anything begins to brown, about two to three minutes. Add the remaining spices: turmeric, fenugreek, coriander, cumin and cayenne. Stir and saut&eacute; for an additional minute.</p> \n<p>3. Add the mango, brown sugar and water to the pot. Stir, increase the heat and bring the liquid up to a simmer. Simmer for five to six minutes, or until the mango has softened and the liquid has slightly reduced. Turn off the heat and add the vinegar to the mango mixture. Taste and adjust to your liking by adding more vinegar, sugar, salt or spices if needed.</p> \n<p>4. Using an immersion blender or blender, puree the mango to the desired consistency. I like mine a little chunky with about half of the mango pieces still intact. If you would like your amba smoother, pur&eacute;e it for longer and add water to thin it out. Note that amba will thicken slightly as it cools.</p> \n<p>5. Once cooled, transfer the amba to jars and refrigerate. Amba keeps well in the refrigerator for about two to three weeks. Makes three pints.</p> \n<p>Sonya Sanford is a Los Angeles- based chef, food stylist and writer.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On Monday, a 36-year-old unemployed helicopter pilot whose sole role in life is to wait around until his grandmother and father are dead so he can inherit the family business will arrive in Israel on a historic visit. His arrival will coincide with the departure of another thirtysomething heir, whose main achievements in life have been losing hundreds of millions of daddy’s money in the New York real-estate market, getting in hock to shady lenders, owning a gossip rag and making a cameo appearance on &quot;Gossip Girl.&quot;</p> \n<p>By coincidence of birth&nbsp;– in William Windsor’s case, and marriage in Jared Kushner's&nbsp;– they are both jetting around the region on taxpayer-funded private airliners, surrounded by numerous government flunkies and meeting with leaders like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Not that there is any reason for anyone to be jealous of either man.</p> \n<p>Kushner is enjoying, for now, the trappings of his position as senior adviser to the president of the United States. In his not-too-distant future, though, he can look forward to having to make the bleak decision whether to rat out his father-in-law or go to jail for his multiple roles in collusion with foreign powers and influence-peddling. Either way, his period of power will be brief and followed by ignominy.</p> \n<p>Prince William’s predicament is of the opposite nature. He is sentenced for life to be a figurehead, forbidden to speak his mind as he is shuttled by courtiers from event to event. His existence is a mind-numbing succession of thousands of handshakes and polite exchanges, while he grows old and becomes a cranky pensioner like his father, Charles, waiting for the demise that will make him king.</p> \n<p>So why are these two princelings, one for life and the other for as long as his toxic father-in-law holds on, here? And what does their arrival say about the nations they represent?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Prince William's Israel visit: Holocaust survivor rescued by Britain at age 6 on royal itinerary&nbsp;■ Big trouble in little Palestine: Britain's rough three decades in the Holy Land</p> \n<p>Kushner may have had no diplomatic experience until Donald Trump won the election, but his political inclinations are known. Everything he has done in the last year and a half, along with his two partners, Ambassador David Friedman and Special Representative Jason Greenblatt, and in coordination with Netanyahu, has been geared to turning the paradigm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on its head.</p> \n<p>Finally, the contours of the “Trump peace plan” are beginning to emerge, and it is clear that as Kushner said in his interview to Al Quds newspaper, “It will be up to the leadership and the people of both sides to determine what is an acceptable compromise in exchange for significant gains.” Or, in other words, the United States isn’t going to bother itself with borders, statehood or refugees. It will make do with setting out some vague guidelines for future negotiations, while offering separate economic incentives for the West Bank and Gaza.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians will have little choice but to reject a plan that doesn’t address their national aspirations, undercuts their political leadership and perpetuates the split between Gaza and the West Bank. This fits perfectly into the vision of Netanyahu, who believes in giving no concessions to the Palestinians, and wearing them down in the belief that they will one day agree to a permanent status of semi-autonomous enclaves. Effectively, it means kicking the can down the road until a new U.S. administration and new Israeli and Palestinian leaderships are prepared to deal with the core issues.</p> \n<p>Kushner and his friends are simply helping prolong the period of suffering that both nations will have to go through until they can find a way to live at peace. His visit is just another signal of America’s abdication of its duty, as the most prosperous nation in history, to try and help the rest of the world solve its problems – a process that began under Barack Obama and has only intensified under his unworthy successor.</p> \n<p>But at least Kushner has some agency and control over his actions. And he will one day, hopefully soon, be held accountable for some of his sins. Prince William has literally no say in his own travel plans. For 70 years since Israel’s establishment, there has not been an official visit by a senior member of the British royal family to Israel. Was that because Queen Elizabeth II and her offspring didn’t want to come? And does the prince’s visit now signal a sudden Zionist change of heart? Who knows.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We are not allowed to know where the queen and her princes actually would like to travel. They have no opinions, no politics, no real power over their lives. For 70 years, the British government and its senior civil servants believed that a royal visit to Israel would harm the United Kingdom’s interests in the Middle East, and should not take place before Israel is at peace with its neighbors. Now they think a prince’s arrival will somehow enhance the relationship and Britain’s standing.</p> \n<p>No one asked William whether he thinks flying to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Territories is a good idea at this time. His views matter about as much as those of the giant pandas that the Chinese leadership sends as gifts to zoos in countries where it is trying to improve its diplomatic relations.</p> \n<p>Just as the 70 years of royal boycott represented a misplaced sense of Britain’s importance in world affairs, so does the change in policy represented by the royal visit now. It won’t help Britain get more of a say in the diplomatic process; Kushner and Netanyahu have shut out everyone else. The petty differences over William’s tour in the Old City being described by the British government as taking place in the “occupied Palestinian Territories” are meaningless. It would have made no difference on the ground whatever the British called it. Neither will the royal visit help Britain curry favor in Jerusalem (or Washington) when its representatives arrive to negotiate trade deals after their departure from the European Union. No amount of royal goodwill is going to help Britain get preferential treatment. The British people have voted for the self-inflicted blow of Brexit and demoted their already much diminished kingdom to fourth-rate status.</p> \n<p>With its pomp and pageantry, the royal family remains a national symbol of unity and is a useful tourist attraction. But even the embarrassingly parochial Israeli politicians who will line up for a handshake with William this week won’t be more inclined to granting Britain a place at the negotiating table, or any trade favors. Those will be doled out according to the calculations of raw power – and Britain doesn’t have much anymore. Its real influence in the region ended on February 14, 1947, when it returned the mandate for Palestine to the United Nations. Prince William is arriving 71 years too late to make a difference.</p>",

Were they born on the moon? It’s Poles, and not one or two.”</p> \n<p>Regarding Poles who saved Jews, and the fact that the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial has recognized around 6,700 Righteous Among the Nations, Bauer said this number was far from “numerous.”</p> \n<p>“Even if we assume that the real figure is 200,000, out of 21 million Poles, that’s only 1 percent,” he said. “What about the other 99 percent?” According to Bauer, the joint declaration “devalues the true Righteous Among the Nations and minimizes the value of their heroism.”</p> \n<p>Bauer said the Poles “cheated us, twisted us around their finger and we agreed to it because to the State of Israel, economic, security and political ties are more important than a little matter like the Holocaust.”</p> \n<p>Bauer said that by signing the declaration, Israel had betrayed Polish historians who had been persecuted by the Polish government because they “tell the truth.” He was referring to scholars such as Prof. Jan Tomasz Gross and Jan Grabowsky, who research the role of Poles’ involvement in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Bauer said Poland would still use civil law to persecute Polish scholars who “tell the truth.”</p> \n<p>“They will demand money from them, they will impoverish them, they will keep funding from them. And we are legitimizing [this] . They will say: ‘What do you want, the Israelis agreed to this, why are you making noise?’”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jewish terrorists are troubled, rebellious youth who have somehow gone astray – distant from Israel’s core values. That’s the stereotype most Israelis have of their fellow citizens who commit violent acts against Arabs in pursuit of their far-right political agenda.</p> \n<p>A new documentary series, “The Jewish Underground” (airing on the Yes Doco channel in Israel), aims to shatter that persistent myth once and for all, telling the story of the country’s most notorious Jewish terrorists who were – and remain – anything but outsiders.</p> \n<p>The three-part series, created by veteran Israeli journalist Shai Gal, relates (and recreates) how a group of determined Jewish settlers committed acts of violence in the early 1980s, blowing up cars, shooting into crowds, planting explosives on buses, and stockpiling explosives with the aim of destroying the Dome of the Rock (part of the site known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif).</p> \n<p>The story of the Jewish Underground isn’t new. But, some 30 years on, it is finally being seen in its full and chilling context.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Revealed: How Israel first thought to deal with &quot;Jewish terror&quot;</p> \n<p>The same men who committed those acts still retain the same ideology and agenda. But today they sit in the center of power in Israeli politics – a far more effective place from which to work toward their vision of a renewed biblical Jewish kingdom with a Third Temple&nbsp;on the Temple Mount.</p> \n<p>As former Jewish Underground member Yehuda Etzion – convicted and imprisoned for his participation in terror activities, and one of the series’ stars – tells Gal: “We are aiming at the same target. We are just using different means.”</p> \n<p>As a young member of the movement, Etzion participated in the plot to blow up the Muslim holy site on the Temple Mount, hoping it would lead to a holy war that would result in Jewish victory.</p> \n<p>Today, he is the leader of a group that works to promote Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount and to revive ancient traditions like animal sacrifice. Indeed, Gal’s series opens with a nighttime reenactment of the Passover sacrifice, the flames of the pyre flickering on Etzion’s face.</p> \n<p>Messianic fervor</p> \n<p>The idea for the series came to Gal as he spent a sabbatical year at the University of Michigan, studying extremist movements. For his research he read “Dear Brothers” by Haggai Segal – now a senior Israeli journalist but who, in his 20s, pleaded guilty to involvement in the planting of bombs that maimed two West Bank mayors. (He eventually served two years of a five-year sentence.)</p> \n<p>The group that became known as the Jewish Underground was an offshoot of the settler movement that evolved into a vigilante cell and began to carry out revenge attacks on Palestinians.</p> \n<p>They were driven by a mixture of frustration that the Israeli government had failed to quell Palestinian violence against Jews and fear that the 1978 Camp David Accords could be a first step toward ending the settlement enterprise, alongside the messianic fervor of members like Etzion.</p> \n<p>The group’s first operation (for which Segal was jailed) occurred in June 1980: Car bomb attacks targeting the mayors of Nablus and Ramallah; a third mayor was spared when the device was found before he started his engine.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Mossad operative who formed the Jewish underground in North Africa</p> \n<p>Israel’s vaunted intelligence services failed to crack the case, and three years later, in July 1983, students at the Islamic College in Hebron were gunned down by Underground members, in revenge for the murder of a yeshiva student. Three people were killed and a further 33 students and faculty members were injured or wounded.</p> \n<p>A year later came the plot that proved to be the group’s downfall: an attempt to blow up five buses carrying Palestinians. The movement's activities were finally detected by the Shin Bet security service, which arrested them after they had placed the bombs on the buses.</p> \n<p>It was only later that the authorities realized the actual extent of the danger the group posed. They had accumulated enough explosives to blow up the Dome of the Rock, which they believed would pave the way toward building the Third Temple.</p> \n<p>Like most Israelis, Gal knew the basic story of the movement. However, he said he was astonished when he really dug into what had happened and was amazed it had never been fully documented on film.</p> \n<p>“The details were crazy,” he says. “These guys actually broke into an army camp in the Golan Heights in 1982, stole over 1,000 kilograms [2,200 pounds] of explosives – mines that were being stored for time of war – and built 27 explosive devices, using 750 kilos of C4 intended to blow up the Temple Mount. This was super-serious.”</p> \n<p>Another revelation for Gal: The fact that the core leaders of the vigilante cell came from the mainstream, not the fringes, of Israeli society.</p> \n<p>“These men were part of the mainstream settler leadership. One was the secretary of Gush Emunim. Another was working at Hebron and Kiryat Arba’s city hall. One was a pilot in the Israel Air Force. There were several sons-in-law of important rabbis, sons-in-law of senior IDF staff. These were not outsiders.”</p> \n<p>What really grabbed Gal’s attention was when he took a close look at where some of the key perpetrators are today. Two are key settler leaders: Ze’ev (“Zambish”) Hever is secretary-general of Amana, a cooperative that builds settlement homes in the West Bank;&nbsp;his stated goal is to settle a million Jews in the next decade. Another Underground leader, Nathan Nathanson, is a close political associate of Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali Bennett, who is also education minister.</p> \n<p>“Once I understood that members of this Jewish Underground who had been convicted for terrorist activity, are now holding positions of power in the highest levels of the Israeli government, I knew it was a story I had to do,” said Gal.</p> \n<p>‘Law &amp; Order: Jewish Underground’</p> \n<p>The first two episodes are structured like an episode of “Law &amp; Order.” The detective story plays out in the initial episode, as Jewish Underground members describe in detail exactly how they came together, planned and perpetrated their crimes. Meanwhile, the senior Shin Bet officials charged with stopping them – the head of the Shin Bet’s Jewish unit, Carmi Gillon, and head of the Jerusalem and West Bank District, Jacob Perry – describe their frustration with the cat-and-mouse game of chasing them, with their targets repeatedly eluding capture.</p> \n<p>“They were very serious and very sophisticated,” concedes Gal. “Think about it: It took the Shin Bet’s A-team four years – 30,000 hours of investigations – to catch them.”</p> \n<p>The second episode reviews the trials, convictions and sentences of the Underground members, in a case led by a state prosecutor who would eventually rise to head the Supreme Court: Dorit Beinisch.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Former Jewish Underground convict receives more than 1.3 million shekels from Israel</p> \n<p>While Beinisch was successful in winning her cases, public pressure – including letters and petitions calling for the convicted terrorists’ early release – chipped away at the consequences of the crimes. Prison conditions were lenient; sentences were reduced for good behavior; and some enjoyed pardons that drastically shortened their sentences.</p> \n<p>Even the three Jewish Underground members convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison for their roles in the Islamic College shooting had their sentences commuted by then-President Chaim Herzog. By December 1990, all of them were free after serving less than seven years in prison.</p> \n<p>That is where the third episode hammers home the story’s central message: The Jewish terrorists emerged from their relatively short sentences to fanfare and celebrations, unrepentant and buoyed by the support they had received from their community. In subsequent years, they have reestablished themselves in positions of influence, moving the country in their desired direction.</p> \n<p>“None of them ever said anything to me&nbsp;like, ‘I was young and stupid when I did these things,’” Gal notes. “They are proud of what they did.”</p> \n<p>In an illustration of how the Jewish Underground’s agenda has gone mainstream, Gal’s film concludes with a “Seekers of Zion” convention in the Knesset held in 2017, honoring Temple Mount activists.</p> \n<p>Leading political figures like Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan showed up to laud the activists’ cause with slides of a rebuilt Temple – the Dome of the Rock nowhere in sight – projected on the wall.</p> \n<p>Religious devotion</p> \n<p>Gillon, who went on to head the Shin Bet in the 1990s, ruefully admits to Gal that, in his view, the Jewish Underground’s side has won the battle between the competing visions of a Jewish and a democratic state. “They are more devoted to their idea,” he says of the former Underground members.</p> \n<p>“It’s exactly what you see with Hamas or Hezbollah,” he notes. “A religious person who believes he is commanded from on high can’t compromise on that command. A secular person is more pragmatic to begin with. But they have one goal: To turn Israel into a Jewish state governed by religious Jewish law, to perpetuate the occupation and to rescind liberal laws.”</p> \n<p>Gal says it was important to assemble the full sweep of these men’s stories over 30 years. Events, he says, move so swiftly in Israel that it is often impossible for people to understand the larger nature of what is happening.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; If an extremist Jewish underground exists, why can't the Shin Bet stop it?</p> \n<p>“Even those like me, as a correspondent who has covered news here for years, operate in a world where we only see parts of the story. We don’t get to see the big picture,&quot; says Gal. &quot;Even senior people in politics who watched my documentary have told me it has helped them see what has really happened here over the last 30 years.”</p> \n<p>Gal grew up on a kibbutz, where he discovered his journalistic curiosity by accidentally overhearing some of the sessions his psychologist mother had with her patients.</p> \n<p>“I knew I loved listening to people’s stories,” he says. Following his army service (he is still a major in the Tank Corps reserves), he entered university, where he “discovered the power of television journalism” and knew he wanted to make a career in it.</p> \n<p>After 13 years as a reporter for Channel 2 News, Gal is now a correspondent on the award-winning, prime time investigative TV show “Uvda” (“Fact” in Hebrew).</p> \n<p>Over the years, his in-depth reporting has often had an impact on events in Israel: His profile on Naama Margolese, an 8-year-old girl terrorized by ultra-Orthodox men in Beit Shemesh in 2011, led to a backlash that resulted in hundreds of thousands demonstrating. A heart-wrenching story he aired on poverty among Israel Defense Forces soldiers was credited with improving their conditions.</p> \n<p>In this case, telling the story of the Jewish Underground may not have immediate results. But Gal hopes it will give the Israeli public pause when they consider the background of some of today’s power players and their impact on Israel’s current reality.</p> \n<p>It is a lesson, he believes, that isn’t exclusive to Israel at this particular moment in time. As extremist movements gain strength around the world, he was told at a recent European screening that his documentary’s message is relevant in many countries.</p> \n<p>“This isn’t just an Israeli story,” he concludes. “It’s the story of how extreme ideology finds its way into mainstream politics.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>On Monday I was up on the Golan Heights, trying to get some kind of impression of the magnitude of the escape of Syrian refugees from bombarded Daraa to the border.</p> \n<p>It was a frustrating assignment. I’ve met Syrian refugees on their country’s borders with Jordan and Turkey and along their migration trail across Europe. This was the first time I’ve seen them, but had no way of making face-to-face contact.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It would have taken a couple of minutes to walk up to them, but a narrow strip of no-man’s land, a border fence, and a minefield prevented any communication.</p> \n<p>There was something very dislocating about being in immediate proximity to so much human suffering, to thousands who after surviving over seven years of civil war (the Syrian uprising against the Assad regime began in Daraa on March 6, 2011), have now had to flee for their lives, and not being able to record their story first-hand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As I was standing at the closest observation post to the two new refugee camps, the IDF’s Chief Rabbi, Brigadier-General Eyal Krim drove up. Naively, I asked him what role the Military Rabbinate was playing in the IDF’s humanitarian operation, which has been delivering regular shipments of food, clothes, tents and medical supplies to the refugees and has so far provided medical treatment for four thousand refugees.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Krim looked at me mystified. “What are you doing here?” I asked again.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“We’re to make sure that the soldiers who have been sent to reinforce the border have properly kosher kitchens and&nbsp;eiruvin&nbsp;[symbolic boundaries] for Shabbat,” he answered.</p> \n<p>The idea that somehow the IDF’s spiritual corps should be looking for a way to aid the thousands of human beings stranded just a few hundred meters away from Israel’s northern frontline hadn’t occurred to him, and still didn’t make sense to him when I actually suggested it. He was just doing his job, supplying the religious needs of IDF soldiers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And maybe that should be a rabbi’s job? Tending to his (or her, though Rabbi Krim wouldn’t recognize a female rabbi) community’s spiritually and making sure they have the basic requisites of Jewish life. Most secular Israelis certainly would be very happy to see rabbis concentrate on their pastoral duties and not interfere in politics. But no rabbi, whether Orthodox or progressive seems reticent when it comes to expressing their political opinions. The two groups have almost nothing in common besides their belief that it is their duty to have a strident view on public affairs.</p> \n<p>What a wide gulf separates Rabbi Krim and his like-minded colleagues from the dozens of American rabbis who in recent weeks have joined and led protests against the Trump administration’s immigration policy and even got themselves arrested in the act. There’s probably no issue that better demonstrates that gulf than the different attitudes towards refugees and migrants.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Who are the rabbis leading protests in recent days against the separation of children from their partners on the U.S.- Mexico borders? Overwhelmingly those of the non-Orthodox streams.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And the same was true in past months of the movement in Israel (supported by many Diaspora Jews) to prevent the Netanyahu government’s plan to deport over thirty thousand Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers back to Africa. Rabbis involved in that movement tended by and large to be progressive ones.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are a handful of exceptions. A few Orthodox rabbis in Israel, like Yuval Cherlow and Avi Gisser, were publicly against the deportation plan. The Orthodox Union in America added its name to a letter from a coalition of Jewish organizations that expressed &quot;strong opposition&quot; to the child separation policy.</p> \n<p>But by and large, it’s the progressives who feel they have to strenuously and vocally act against anti-migrant policies while the Orthodox rabbis in their overwhelming majority who simply don’t understand why helping non-Jewish refugees is something they should be involved in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The differences are theological, ideological and political. Progressive rabbis will repeatedly remind us that the Torah exhorts us to welcome and love the ger - the stranger living among us, 36 times, more than any other commandment. But even they will admit that this is a new reading of the Torah. The standard translation of&nbsp;ger has always been a person who has chosen to live beside the Jewish people and abide by the Torah’s commandments. Not just any random stranger.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Besides, no amount of warmth to&nbsp;gerim can change the fact that the Jewish foundational text, with its commandments to destroy entire foreign nations and raze to the earth towns of idol-worshippers, is riddled with xenophobia, racism and intolerance to the other. Those looking to the Torah (or the New Testament) for justification for illiberal and cruel policies will always find ample ammunition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not that the Orthodox or ultra-Orthodox rabbis are celebrating a particularly &quot;authentic&quot; Judaism either. Just as the progressive rabbis are simply clothing their western liberal values in biblical or Talmudic quotations, so are the Orthodox ideologies modern concepts. There is of course no such thing as authentic Judaism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israeli Orthodoxy is a nationalist creed, invented by Rabbi A.Y. Kook a century ago. Ultra-Orthodoxy, or Haredism, is a reactionary movement that is only slightly older, and can trace its roots just as far back as the emancipation of Jews in Europe, which is when Reform Judaism was born as well. All three main ideological streams of Judaism today pick and choose whatever is convenient for their political needs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no &quot;Jewish&quot; attitude towards immigration.</p> \n<p>An American progressive rabbi fights for the rights of immigrants on the U.S.- Mexico border because Jewish ideals of Tikkun Olam are identical to standard Western liberal values. An Israeli Orthodox rabbi has no problem with the deportation of African migrants because the Jewish character of Israel must be preserved and he thinks Donald Trump is a good thing because apparently he’s “pro-Israel” and nothing else matters. A Haredi rabbi simply isn’t interested in these matters because a Jew isn’t supposed to get involved in goyshe stuff.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By and large, it doesn’t take that much bravery or conviction for rabbis of any persuasion. In nearly all cases, they are expressing the views that are prevalent among their communities. A Reform rabbi fighting for immigrant rights will be in sync with their members, who are overwhelmingly liberal anyway. An Orthodox rabbi won’t get in trouble for not sticking up for African asylum-seekers as most of his community will be in favor of kicking them out anyway.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A few months ago, a very senior figure in one of the largest American-Jewish organizations called up an old friend of his, a world-famous, celebrated Orthodox rabbi, and begged him to lend his influential voice to the campaign against Netanyahu’s deportation plan. I’m not at liberty to say his name but I’m sure quite a few readers know exactly who the rabbi is and are not surprised at his refusal to stick his neck out.</p> \n<p>And let’s be perfectly honest, how many progressive rabbis were standing up for immigrants two years ago, when the administration that was chasing them down and carrying out policies which were not as cruel as today’s, but abhorrent nevertheless, was Barack Obama’s?</p> \n<p>Jewish experience teaches us that anti-immigrant policies and governments are usually tainted by anti-Semitism as well and that we have a historical duty to ensure that other immigrants are not treated like our ancestors who were denied safe haven. I believe that. But I’m just one Jew with a column in Haaretz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ask French Jews who have worked so hard to successfully integrate in to their society, what they think about the neighboring Muslim immigrant communities whose members have murdered them in recent years. Ask Israeli nationalists who are convinced that security can only be found in a strong Jewish state that accepts only Jewish immigrants. Ask Haredim who will tell you that all this liberal mumbo-jumbo is a deviation from the true path of Torah and a prelude to the holocaust of assimilation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no true Jewish attitude to immigration, one of the greatest defining issues of Western politics in our age. There are competing visions of what it means to be a Jew today and where we stand on refugee rights is intrinsically related to how we see our Judaism and humanity. And the dilemmas are about to get much harder.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If recent reports on an impending four-way deal between Israel, Syria, Russia and the U.S. are anything to go by, the Israeli-Syrian refugee dilemma may be about to become much more immediate, and deadly, very soon. The deal would allow the Assad regime to regain control of the border region in return for guarantees that Iranian-aligned forces would be banished from southern Syria and Israel would be allowed to continue operating against Iranians in other parts of Syria as well.</p> \n<p>Assuming the deal goes through, those thousands of Syrian refugees on the Golan could end up being sacrificed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Will Israel stand by while on its doorstep Syrians are being massacred or deported on buses to an uncertain future? Who will advocate risking the lives of Israeli soldiers and jeopardizing a deal that gets Iran out of Syria to save refugees? There’s no clear Jewish answer for that dilemma.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem harshly criticized the joint statement signed last week by both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki, following Poland's decision to amend a controversial law that criminalized those accusing the Polish nation of complicity in Nazi era crimes.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Yad Vashem vs. Bibi: When there's nothing to celebrate, Netanyahu runs from the cameras | Analysis ■ FULL TEXT: Yad Vashem historians rebuke Netanyahu over Israeli-Polish statement on 'Holocaust law'</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem&nbsp;said in a statement that the Israeli-Polish declaration contained a number of historical errors, and that it paves the way to continue with legal battles against historians and other Holocaust researchers – even if these will now be only civil and not criminal proceedings.</p> \n<p>“A thorough review by Yad Vashem historians shows that the historical assertions, presented as unchallenged facts, in the joint statement contain grave errors and deceptions, and that the essence of the statute remains unchanged even after the repeal of the aforementioned sections, including the possibility of real harm to researchers, unimpeded research, and the historical memory of the Holocaust,” said Yad Vashem in its statement, released a week after the official joint statement. The Yad Vashem document was signed by the institution’s senior historians Prof. Dan Michman, Prof. Hava Dreifuss and Dr. David Silberklang.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel is yielding to Poland's Holocaust narrative&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Israel's stupid, ignorant and amoral betrayal of the truth on Polish involvement in the Holocaust&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■ Dear Poland: Your Holocaust law fools no one. No one forgets&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem warned of a possible wave of lawsuits by Polish groups against those who “impugn the good name of the Polish State and the Polish Nation,” as the language of the law stpiulates. By Polish law, the burden of proof in these cases will be on the defendants and not the plaintiffs, which will force defendants to raise large sums to defend themselves in court.</p> \n<p>Even worse, now that the criminal sanctions have been removed, the reservations to them that appeared in the original text, which stated that it does not apply to artists and researchers, have been removed as well. In practice, according to Yad Vashem, this means that now researchers, artists, tour guides, politicians and others can be sued for statements not made in public and that “are not contradicted by the facts.”</p> \n<p>As a result, many people could now be exposed to suits because they fulfilled their rights to freedom of speech and academic freedom concerning the Holocaust, said Yad Vashem. This will create an atmosphere of intimidation, which will deter people from touching on sensitive questions that are the foundations of Holocaust research.</p> \n<p>Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Bartosz Cichocki stuck by&nbsp;the joint Israeli-Polish statement, telling Polish news outlets in response that Netanyahu's commitment is the one that is &quot;binding&quot;, not Yad Vashem's statement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett said in response that the statement &quot;is a disgrace rife with lies. As education minister, charged with teaching the memory of the Holocaust, I fully reject it. It lacks a historical basis and will not be taught in schools.&quot; Bennett added that he would ask the prime minister to either cancel the declaration or bring it to the government to be approved.</p> \n<p>&quot;The historical reality is that Poles assisting Jews was a relatively rare phenomenon, while Poles hurting Jews was widespread,&quot; the minister continued.</p> \n<p>Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid also referred to the statement as a disgrace and called on Netanyahu to immediately cancel the joint statement with Poland. Lapid said the statement &quot;outrageously debases the memory of the victims... 200 thousand Jews were killed by Poles in the Holocaust, and Netanyahu signs a declaration that clears the Poles' name.&quot;</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem released its statement even though Netanyahu thanked Yad Vashem’s chief historian, Prof. Dina Porat, for her help in in his explanation of the joint declaration. Yad Vashem has said that if Prof. Porat was involved, it wasn't on behalf of the institution.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the Polish government published a Hebrew translation of the joint statement (written in English and not in either of the native languages of the countries involved) in ads it bought in Israeli newspapers.</p> \n<p>On June 27, after months of secret negotiations between Israel and Poland, the Polish government amended the section imposing criminal sanctions in the “Holocaust Law,” which was passed in January. In signing the joint statement, Israel in fact accepted the Polish narrative concerning the Holocaust, which emphasizes the efforts of the Poles in saving Jews and minimizes their role in persecuting and killing Jews.</p> \n<p>The Yad Vashem historians specifically criticized the wording of the joint statement signed by Netanyahu and Morawiecki, saying it has a number of sections that are historically controversial, such as recognizing that the Polish Government-in-Exile&nbsp;and the Polish underground acted to rescue Jews during World War II, and “attempted to stop this Nazi activity by trying to raise awareness among the Western allies of the systematic murder of the Polish Jews.”</p> \n<p>“The statement contains highly problematic wording that contradicts existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field. The joint statement’s wording effectively supports a narrative that research has long since disproved, namely, that the Polish Government-in-Exile and its underground arms strove indefatigably—in occupied Poland and elsewhere—to thwart the extermination of Polish Jewry. As such, they created a ‘mechanism of systematic help and support to Jewish people’ and even took vigorous action against Poles who betrayed Jews. Although the joint statement acknowledges that there were cases in which Poles committed cruelties against Jews, it is also says that “numerous Poles” risked their lives to rescue Jew,” write the historians.</p> \n<p>But they continue: “The existing documentation and decades of historical research yield a totally different picture: the Polish Government-in-Exile, based in London, as well as the Delegatura (the representative organ of this Government in occupied Poland) did not act resolutely on behalf of Poland’s Jewish citizens at any point during the war. Much of the Polish resistance in its various movements not only failed to help Jews, but was also not infrequently actively involved in persecuting them.”</p> \n<p>The document does “acknowledge and condemn every single case of cruelty against Jews perpetrated by Poles during WWII,” but only as individuals and refers to “the sad fact is that some people – regardless of their origin, religion or worldview – revealed their darkest side at that time.”</p> \n<p>At the same time it states: “We are honored to remember heroic acts of numerous Poles, especially the Righteous Among the Nations, who risked their lives to save Jewish people,” while rejecting “the actions aimed at blaming Poland or the Polish nation as a whole for the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their collaborators of different nations.”</p> \n<p>Another controversial part of the joint declaration is its final section, which drew parallels between anti-Semitism and “anti-Polonism and other negative national stereotypes” and condemned both equally. “While we should put an end to the use of the misleading and ill-conceived concept of ‘Polish death camps,’ calling the use of such terms ‘anti-Polonism’ is fundamentally anachronistic and has nothing whatsoever to do with antisemitism.”</p> \n<p>The statement from Yad Vashem emphasized that this is the official, and only official position of the institution and its scholars. The statement was released after Prof. Yehuda Bauer, an Israel Prize-winning Holocaust historian formerly at Yad Vashem, said last week that the Israeli-Polish statement was a “betrayal” that “hurt the Jewish people and the memory of the Holocaust.”</p> \n<p>In a radio interview, the 92-year-old said the backtracking on the law and the signing of a joint statement with Poland was “a small achievement and a very big mistake, bordering on betrayal.” Bauer said Israel had accepted the Polish narrative and “legitimized it,” even though it was a “completely mendacious story.” Bauer said the Poles “cheated us, twisted us around their finger and we agreed to it because to the State of Israel, economic, security and political ties are more important than a little matter like the Holocaust.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I blame myself for not standing by him in real time. I’m hardly ever afraid of being lynched, but this time I was deterred. I failed. Garbuz is right,” wrote Haaretz's Rogel Alpher about 10 days ago. Garbuz got the message. “I admit that it made me very happy and was very important to me,” he says of these things now. “Incidentally, every day there are more people asking me for forgiveness.”</p> \n<p>Over three years have passed since the fateful speech – the one about “amulet kissers and those who prostrate themselves at the graves of the saints” – delivered by renowned&nbsp;Israeli artist Yair Garbuz in Rabin Square, Tel Aviv, before the 2015 election, which resulted in public condemnation and fury, on both the right and the left. Since then many things have happened – Miri Regev was appointed culture minister, the prime minister and half of his cabinet are under investigation or indictment, Eurovision, Messi – and still, they don’t forget what Garbuz said. Neither does he.</p> \n<p>In all the interviews he has given since that speech, Garbuz repeatedly explained that he doesn’t regret what he said, because his words were deliberately distorted, and that he was never referring to the Mizrahim in his speech. “Very few people can say ‘I was lynched.’ And I was,” he says in an interview at the Zuzu Gallery in Emek Hefer, where his new exhibition is on display.</p> \n<p>“But I managed – because I knew that if my words really did include anything against Mizrahi ethnic groups I’m the first who would have apologized for that. Because what are they talking about, I’ve been dealing with that for 30 years. Anyone who hears me at a lecture tells me that I sound like the members of the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition” (a Mizrahi social justice organization).</p> \n<p>‘I was left without a camp. Nothing.’</p> \n<p>However, perhaps because of the time that has passed, today Garbuz speaks openly about the sense of abandonment and helplessness that he experienced. About friends who didn’t call, fans who didn’t say a word, reports that placed words into the speech that were never there. “What I don’t understand is why the people who said at the lectures that I talk like the Mizrahi Rainbow, didn’t say in real time – ‘He’s been talking about that for years, it’s not possible that he would say something like that against Mizrahi ethnic groups’?</p> \n<p>“And more important is that people I worked with for 30 years didn’t pick up a phone. Even if I didn’t agree with someone about something he said, I would pick up a phone and ask how he’s doing, The fact that he said something I don’t agree with, does that mean that I want him to be threatened? That he’ll be afraid to open the door?</p> \n<p>“It’s not that I was hurt,” he says. “Sometimes you come from a certain camp, and you have an opinion and you criticize the other camp. But as a result of that, I was left without a camp. Nothing.”</p> \n<p>The exhibition “Ein Gvul Lefanekha” (“There’s No Border Before You”), which opened at the end of May, will be on display until July 7, and includes works by Garbuz from the past two years. In his characteristic style, the works are a wild and seemingly careless combination of plays on words, texts full of humor, and hints, imitations and “borrowings” from works by others. These works always connect with the Israeli experience, even if Garbuz says that it happens almost by chance. Asked whether in the exhibition he dealt with what he experienced as the result of that incident in Rabin Square, he answers indirectly.</p> \n<p>“Whenever something happens and is in your soul, it’s also in the work of art in some way. This way you’re your own strictest, most truthful judge, and if you didn’t say something, you can’t apologize – you decided to lie. And if you create a painting that you know will be hard for people to accept, then let it be hard to accept. And if you create a painting that they’re liable to distort, then let them distort it, but the fault will lie with the distorters and not the artist.”</p> \n<p>In one of the works in the exhibition, you see two figures who are clearly Yemenite, with shoelaces instead of side curls, and above them is the inscription “Kibbutz or Exiles,” which is also the name of the work. In a short conversation with a group of critics before the interview, he explained that during his childhood many Yemenites used to sell shoelaces – and served as models for artists like him, in the kibbutz. “Since people said that they are passive, that they don’t move much, that became etched in me – that they took an entire group and attributed only one characteristic to it.”</p> \n<p>There’s no question, therefore, that the blow he received after the speech didn’t censor him – not in his art nor in his words. He continues to burrow into the country’s past and into the direction it’s heading, and to deal humorously with the most difficult issues.</p> \n<p>In conversation too, often he uses jokes that illustrate what he means. “You have to both laugh at these things, and to clarify them,” he explains. “If you deal with these things humorously, the person through whom you laugh at the injustice is liable to be insulted by the laughter. But humor is essential, it’s like laughing gas in the dentist’s office – it’s to enable you to undergo a root canal. Root canal is what I do, and the laughing gas confuses and misleads people.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, he believes, discrimination in Israel is closely related to a deliberate erasure of history. “The country began from a restart of history, and thinks that at any given moment it’s possible to do another restart,” he says. “Government, both left and right, uses history only in order to glue us,” he continues. “Two epoxy glues are keeping the Israeli public in place, and the exhibition clearly contains that: folklore and fear. And every time they tend to scare us and to make us happy. The news is supposed to make us embrace because soon another terrible thing will happen. And therefore that’s another way they’re writing history, giving us homework in how to defend ourselves and how to unite. The question of truth is irrelevant.”</p> \n<p>‘I resigned from the judges’ panels’</p> \n<p>Along with his work as an artist and writer, another aspect of Garbuz’ professional life is art education. For 14 years, until 2011, he served as the head of Beit Berl College’s Faculty of Arts – Midrasha, and afterwards he joined his friend Yaakov Dorchin in the Basis Art School in Herzliya as a coordinator of cultural activity. In that role he presents podcasts that survey the history of Israeli art, hosts artists for discussions and conducts a series of meetings with curator Tali Tamir, “Dibur-Tziyur” (“Talk and Painting”), where they discuss paintings.</p> \n<p>In all his educational activities he aspired to bring the historical connection into the art world. “The Midrasha is the first place that taught Israeli art. On that subject we were the pioneers. Because we said, if there’s no art here, then we don’t have to teach art here.”</p> \n<p>According to Garbuz, the erasing of history in Israel is even more flagrant when it comes to the art world. “You go to the Musee D’Orsay in Paris, you see post-Impressionism, what there was in the 18th century, the 19th century. You come to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art or the Israel Museum, and what do you learn? The curators’ taste. That’s what you know. You don’t know what happened in the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s. There’s no historical stratification. They do good work, but it’s the work of a gallery, not a museum.</p> \n<p>“Every retrospective exhibition in Israel is a royal burial with a confirmed kill,” he adds. “Because you know that now they’ve checked off that box, they’ve solved the matter, they’ve presented this artist. While in other places you go inside and there’s a Rothko room, or a Rauschenberg room. There’s this collection and that collection. The only ones who really become history is artists whose families know how to maintain museums for them, like Kuperman, Nachum Gutman, Marcel Janko. It’s a catastrophe.”</p> \n<p>Garbuz’s departure from the Midrasha marked his retirement, at least officially. Today, at 72, he divides his time between his home in Ramat Gan and a house in Safed that he bought with his wife. And although between his work and the media echoes he’s quite a busy man, he insists that he feels like a retiree. The real retirement was his retirement from the humorless bureaucracy.</p> \n<p>“The first thing I did when I retired was to inform myself that I wouldn’t sit on any judges’ panel anymore, no instrumental committee, and I won’t write a single letter of recommendation,” he says. “That’s really hard for me, because I have a large number of former students whom I like very much, but I’m finished with the formal texts. I can no longer write that someone is talented and worthy and has potential. I’m willing instead to sign for them as a guarantor for a mortgage.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“This isn’t the way,” Ahad Ha’am wrote in the paper Ha-Melitz in 1889, criticizing “practical Zionism.” As he put it, “Any belief or opinion that leads to action is necessarily based on these three sentences: 1. That achieving a known end is a heartfelt need. 2. That known actions are the means to achieve this end. 3. That these actions aren’t beyond our power and the exertion they require doesn’t exceed the value we place on this end.”</p> \n<p>Anyone trying to take action to create a different Israel should keep the words of this Zionist philosopher in the front of his mind.</p> \n<p>A sense of whining confusion and forlorn powerlessness arises from the debate in Haaretz over what the Israeli left should do in the current situation. Various writers have made various proposals, each according to his own worldview and political loyalties.</p> \n<p>Some call for pragmatism: The left must leave its purist bubble and take shelter under the wings of parties (Zionist Union, Yesh Atid) capable of replacing the protofascist government that’s gradually consolidating here (Emilie Moatti, June 28, Tzvia Greenfield, May 28, Uzi Baram, May 29). Others urge us to wake up from our naivete and embrace the vision of annexation and apartheid (Eitan Cabel, May 25), or view the very term “left” as a stigma (Nachman Shai in an interview with the paper Makor Rishon, May 25).</p> \n<p>Some insist on sticking to the mainstream left’s traditional values (two states for two peoples, a welfare state, the rule of law) and hope to expand their ranks within the accepted political game. They believe that if the left stops apologizing and holds its standard aloft, an Israeli Spring will arrive (Tamar Zandberg, June 22). And there are some bound by political commitments laden with intrigues and special interests, paying lip service to the anachronistic frameworks they’re committed to (Ayman Odeh, April 18). But all this prattling is no more than a barren debate on the deck of the Israeli Titanic.</p> \n<p>There are also Israeli organizations fighting tooth and nail to create an alternative to the conversation and practices that prevail at the top – an alternative that favors Israeli-Arab coexistence, humanistic education, human rights in the territories, exposing the injustices of the occupation, and providing legal assistance to Palestinians. The left’s galaxy of idle chatter is also studded with groups of authors, intellectuals and academics who believe they have the power to come up with a magic formula that will convince hundreds of thousands of people to flock to the polls on Election Day with the correct ballot in their hands.</p> \n<p>But the stubbornly consistent election polls reveal a reality whose end isn’t visible on the horizon. The current mix that characterizes the ruling parties – a combination of thuggishness, ignorance, corruption, religious extremism, misogyny, racism and simple opportunism – will continue to dominate, with or without Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>A tale of two Congress parties</p> \n<p>If we adopt Ahad Ha’am’s insights, we will conclude that all this activity by all the aforementioned leftist players is being conducted out of a strong and sincere desire to achieve a worthy goal. Still, a big question remains about Ahad Ha’am’s other two assumptions. Are the actions being taken indeed a means for achieving this goal, and is the goal truly not beyond the power of those trying to achieve it?</p> \n<p>We must state bravely that this search, which has been going on for years now, for something that would produce the big bang to divert Israel onto another course, is a wasted effort. The heroic actions of thousands of activists in peace groups and human rights organizations has managed, perhaps, to preserve tiny islands of sanity in Israeli life, but it hasn’t fundamentally changed the reality.</p> \n<p>It’s worth studying a few lessons from the battle against apartheid in South Africa. Few people remember that the boycott movement there actually began as a domestic effort by the African National Congress in 1952. Its model was the effort by India’s Congress Party in the ‘30s, which called for a consumer boycott that undermined Britain’s economic interests such as its monopoly on salt production. In other words, long before there was an external boycott, a boycott was organized within South Africa by opponents of the regime.</p> \n<p>The Israeli parallel could be, say, a clear call by everyone who sees themselves as belonging to the “peace and democracy” camp to sever all ties with economic, academic, social and cultural activity taking place in the settlements or with groups that promote the occupation, racism and racist hatred. What’s needed is a clear and sweeping statement that such activity is a legitimate popular struggle to end the occupation, a first and necessary stage in a broader change.</p> \n<p>Awareness of the situation in South Africa began filtering into the West, and especially the United States, after human rights activists realized there was a connection between, say, the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama – which was ignited by Rosa Parks in December 1955 – and the Sharpeville massacre in South Africa in March 1960 in which police killed 69 black demonstrators. But liberal groups worldwide haven’t yet made the connection between their war on xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism in their own countries and, for example, the war crime Israel committed when it slaughtered more than 120 Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>Gorgeous mosaic</p> \n<p>The Israeli left’s great task is to create this necessary connection. This needs to be done cautiously, in the spirit of Ahad Ha’am’s instructions.</p> \n<p>First, an “alliance of minorities” must be created in Israel, similar to the alliance Barack Obama created that brought him to victory in the presidential race. In the United States, this alliance included African-Americans, Hispanics, women and white liberals.</p> \n<p>In Israel, its base must be Jewish liberals and leftists and Arabs. The Israeli left must understand that the only hope – albeit a small one – to change Israel’s direction lies in creating a full alliance with the Arab minority. After that, the left must also try to add other spurned groups to this coalition of minorities.</p> \n<p>The organizations and parties that comprise Israel’s “peace and democracy” camp must forge connections with parallel groups in Europe and America. Through them, it must reach out to artists, sports teams, educational and cultural associations and academia and explain that they must start implementing a policy of “conditional boycott” on Israel.</p> \n<p>For instance, you want a sporting event or rock concert in Jerusalem? Reserve tickets for residents of East Jerusalem and the territories. You want to be invited to an scientific conference abroad? Make it easier for researchers from Palestinian universities to obtain exit visas and let those universities exercise academic freedom, which is currently grossly violated by the army and the Shin Bet security service. You want Eurovision? Show that you’re taking steps to ease the Gaza blockade and give humanitarian aid to the people imprisoned in that terrible ghetto. Otherwise, we won’t come.</p> \n<p>This isn’t an easy task; it requires a march down an unpaved road. On the one hand, we must avoid being identified with the BDS movement, since any such identification would close channels of communication with, for instance, Jewish organizations, which have trouble swallowing the idea of a sweeping boycott of Israel. On the other hand, we must persuade organizations worldwide that only a policy of “conditional boycott” can get Israeli society to understand the cost of the occupation and reach the requisite conclusions.</p> \n<p>The cumulative effect of cancellations, like the soccer match with Argentina, will be felt immediately. Netanyahu understood this better than anyone; he immediately grasped the significance of the cancellation and the danger crouching at the door. His rapid retreat from the idea of holding Eurovision in Jerusalem exemplifies this understanding.</p> \n<p>The Israeli left must find a hammer of persuasion so as not to miss the opportunity. It must act in the spirit of Ahad Ha’am’s hope: “Not by might, not by power, but by spirit, and then the day will come on which our hands, too, will create understanding.”</p> \n<p>Prof. Daniel Blatman is a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Polish and Israeli governments have reached an agreement on an amendment to the Polish law that states that claiming that Poland as a country, or the Polish people, were responsible for crimes committed by the Nazis is a criminal offense punishable by up to three years in prison. According to the agreement, this criminal aspect was removed.</p> \n<p>The Polish government passed the law to begin with to defend its good name against accusations that many Poles took part in the murder of Jews during the Holocaust. And who will decide on the historical facts? According to the Poles, it will be the Institute of National Remembrance, which is run by the politicians controlling the country today.</p> \n<p>And so according to the law – even after the agreement with Israel – the government will determine what happened in the past via historians in its service, and this narrative cannot be critiqued by historians, independent researchers or others. Is this acceptable to the Israeli government?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; With Nationalists in Power, Can Jews Ever Feel at Home in Poland?&nbsp;| Opinion ■ The Polish were once victims of historical whitewashing. Now they are doing the same&nbsp;|&nbsp;Analysis&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The joint announcement by Israel and Poland also states that many segments of Polish society helped Jews. This position diminishes the heroism of Poland’s Righteous Among the Nations because the noble-spirited Polish rescuers had to hide not only from the Germans, but also, and perhaps mainly, from their Polish neighbors.</p> \n<p>Yad Vashem has recognized some 6,750 Polish Righteous Among the Nations. They are a small and courageous minority. Unfortunately, the social norm that was accepted in occupied Poland was completely different: The usual conduct was not to help Jews, but to harm them, and many Poles were involved in the persecution of Jews. Europeans’ cooperation with the Nazi death machine was widespread, of course, not only in Poland. But in other countries, scholars who uncover this can’t be penalized.</p> \n<p>As for the abrogation of the criminal aspect of the law, let’s not forget that this also means eliminating the exception of historians and literary figures whose profession is to write about this subject. From now on they too, and of course also journalists, educators, politicians and others, can be sued for revealing historical truths. Eliminating the criminal aspect lifts the threat of imprisonment and fines in criminal proceedings, but not punishment in civil proceedings.</p> \n<p>In fact, the revamped law encourages civil suits against Poles who claim that a good many Poles were involved in persecuting Jews. Naturally, this claim is correct. There were Poles who gave Jews up to the Polish police, who in turn gave them to the Germans. There were those who turned Jews in directly to the Germans, and there were those who murdered Jews themselves.</p> \n<p>The clauses of the law that still stand can, apparently, be imposed via civil proceedings against anyone claiming that the main motives for persecuting Jews were the anti-Semitism of a good many Poles and the greed of Poles who on a huge scale throughout Poland stole the possessions of those who were deported and murdered.</p> \n<p>The Law and Justice party now rules Poland, with a decisive majority in parliament. In fact, the government is in the hands of the party chairman, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who in this is imitating Stalin, who controlled the Soviet Union from his position as head of the Bolshevik party. Kaczynski and his party are of course anti-Communist, so their rule can be defined as Bolshevik anti-Communism.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;Neither Poland nor Israel can afford their fixation with the past&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kaczynski announced a few days ago that preparations are already being made in civil courts to sue offenders. These people could be required to pay high fines.</p> \n<p>Polish liberals, academics, journalists and simply honest people who want to expose the acts of harassment by Poles against Jews during the Holocaust could risk impoverishment and loss of livelihood. It may be assumed that their research funding will be reduced or eliminated, and honest people will be removed from their jobs. Poland will quickly become an illiberal democracy, the term favored by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who supports this nationalist-populist revolt and will receive a royal welcome by the Israeli government on his upcoming visit here.</p> \n<p>The declaration by Warsaw and Jerusalem legitimizes this betrayal by the Israeli government of the historical truth, the memory of the Holocaust and the marvelous people in Poland who investigated the facts on which we base our criticism. And for what did the Israeli government sacrifice truth and justice? For its current economic, security and political interests, which are more important than some Holocaust that happened 70 or 80 years ago.</p> \n<p>We accepted the mendacious official Polish narrative, and swallowed it. If we come now to the Americans or the Europeans with complaints against what this generates in Poland, they’ll answer us, and rightfully, that the Israeli government accepted the Polish facts. I don’t know what was going on here – ignorance, stupidity or the clear amoral victory of transient interests that will remain with us as an eternal disgrace. And perhaps it was simply betrayal.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Seventy years ago, on the eve of Israel’s establishment, six Polish Christians were executed without trial in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem by the Haganah, the pre-independence army of Palestine’s Jews. Despite the decades that have passed, the investigative report on these killings, which was submitted to David Ben-Gurion, has never been made public. The state archivist, Dr. Yaacov Lozowick, has recommended that the report documenting these unrelated cases be made available to the public, but the military censors are trying to block this for reasons known only to them.</p> \n<p>Even seven decades later, the report – a detailed summary of which is being made public here for the first time – is difficult reading. The following, for example, comes from the description of the first case: “Three weeks ago, a Polish Christian was arrested in Tel Aviv and taken to Yona base [the Haganah base in Independence Park]. He was not interrogated. His guard shot and killed him. The body was taken and thrown into Hadassah Garden” – the site of today’s Gan Ha’ir mall in central Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>According to one version of this story, as recounted in the report, the Polish detainee attacked the guard, who shot him in response. “The prisoner, after the shots, was dying. Accordingly, after considerations, it was decided to liquidate him and remove him from the base,” the report states.</p> \n<p>A later a case involved a “Polish Christian who was arrested in Tel Aviv on KKL Boulevard” (today Ben-Gurion Boulevard). His interrogation, which was conducted “with torture,” revealed him to be an underworld figure involved in robberies from an early age, and “it was clarified that he had ties with the Germans abroad.” As the report puts it, “There was a suspicion that he was not sane. Executed.”</p> \n<p>Two more Poles were killed in similar circumstances after being arrested near Jerusalem’s Central Bus Station because “they could not explain the purpose of their presence there.” The report cites different accounts regarding the circumstances of their death. According to one version, their interrogation did not lead to charges against them, but nevertheless, “they were executed.” In another account, “suspicion arose that they were spying on the preparations for the convoys leaving for Tel Aviv.” It also was claimed that “a letter recommending him as a German Nazi” was found among the effects of one of them, though it’s not clear what was meant by this.</p> \n<p>Yet another Pole, also arrested in Jerusalem, is described as an “instructor of gangs” and a “well-known thief” who, “according to rumors,” worked for the British criminal investigation department. But his execution had nothing to do with these allegations. According to the report, he was put to death mainly because it was feared that he would be able to reveal to others the address of the site where he was interrogated by the Haganah.</p> \n<p>“Since he was arrested with another two [people], who were released following a brief interrogation, and the danger existed that the police would search for him, he was moved hastily to another place and wasn’t blindfolded,” the report states. “For reasons related to the danger of revelations by him if he were released, and also on the basis of the material we noted it was decided to liquidate him.”</p> \n<p>The circumstances of the death of the sixth Pole mentioned in the report are not cited.</p> \n<p>Who were the victims?</p> \n<p>Who were these Poles, why were they in the country on the eve of Israel’s founding, and why were they killed in quick succession? The 18-page report does not answer these questions fully. It was written on March 1, 1948, by Yaakov Riftin, a member of the so-called Security Committee, which approved security-policy decisions before Israel’s establishment in May 1948. Riftin presented the results of an examination he carried out at the request of Ben-Gurion, the committee’s head, concerning a series of sensitive events.</p> \n<p>Unlike the report, Riftin’s letter of appointment has been published in several venues over the years.</p> \n<p>“Serious complaints and accusations have reached me about disorder and lawlessness among several members of the organization [the Haganah] and the Palmach [the Haganah’s elite strike force],” Ben-Gurion wrote, providing a list: “robbery of Arabs, murder of Poles and Arabs without cause or with insufficient cause, and in any case without trial, improper actions toward Jews as well, cases of theft, embezzlement of funds, torture of Arabs during interrogation and the like.”</p> \n<p>The then-future prime minister added, “These deeds, if they occurred, constitute a political and moral danger to the organization and to the Yishuv [the Jewish community of Mandatory Palestine], and the most stringent measures must be taken to uproot them.”</p> \n<p>Attached to the letter of appointment was a list of incidents that had been provided to Ben-Gurion by the head of Haganah intelligence, David Shaltiel, and which Riftin was requested to examine. In the report, Riftin sets forth his findings and adds a list of 15 other events that he had heard about but did not examine.</p> \n<p>“When the fighting started, before the [establishment of the] state, I was a one-person committee of inquiry,” Riftin said in 1957 in testimony that’s now in the Ben-Gurion Archives. “I was asked by Ben-Gurion to investigate the complaints, which came from different sides, about people being killed without trial. He asked me to investigate several cases involving the Arabs and not only about Arabs but also people who were suspected of espionage. There were cases of this sort, which caused concern. I was given the powers of a committee of inquiry, and a secretary – Nehemiah Argov.”</p> \n<p>The conclusions of the Riftin report on the killings have also been published in several venues; historians have quoted from the report, even if it has never been made public in full. Its very existence was hitherto known only among experts on the history of the Israel Defense Forces and the state’s creation.</p> \n<p>No secrets</p> \n<p>The report should have been declassified and made accessible to the public in 1998, on the 50th anniversary of its compilation. But two state archivists requested that it remain sealed and received the consent of a rarely convened ministerial committee that deals with permission to view classified archival material.</p> \n<p>Four years ago Lozowick, now the outgoing state archivist, asked the cabinet secretary at the time, Avichai Mendelblit, for permission to let the public peruse the Riftin report. “There is a demand from the public” for the document to be made available, he wrote Mendelblit, adding that, contrary to his predecessors, he recommended that the report be fully declassified. That approach was opposed by Ilana Alon, the director of the IDF and Defense Establishment Archives. But while Alon explained her objections in a classified letter, Lozowick’s opinion is open to everyone and represents an extremely liberal approach rare in the Israeli archival world.</p> \n<p>“There is no justification for continuing to close the file,” Lozowick wrote. “Wars are the most extreme form of policy that a government can pursue. As such, it is most important for the documentation of wars to be open to the public. The period of closure having passed, it is obligatory to open the documentation. Longer closure on the documentation of war is justified only if it contains very special content. In this file, there is none.”</p> \n<p>He added: “A democratic society is obliged to allow a free discussion of its wars. The discussion is a guarantee of democratic resilience. This file perhaps contains material for such a discussion, but that is a reason to open it, not close it.”</p> \n<p>Lozowick stressed that the file contained nothing of current operational significance. “Concealment of historical documentation after so many years shows that the state has something to hide. If after the passage of more than half a century, and after repeated examinations by officials and discussion by cabinet members, the state is still concealing certain files from the public, it is only because they contain particularly dark secrets – that is what the reasonable individual understands,” he wrote. “But there are none. There are no secrets at all [in the report]. The State of Israel is strong, Israeli society is strong, and there is no reason not to allow its citizens free research of the documentation of its wars now remote.”</p> \n<p>The relevant ministerial committee, consisting of Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz and Culture Minister Miri Regev, rejected that argument and blocked the report from being made available to the public. The reasons were not published, though the committee did not order restrictions on the perusal of the document in several Israeli archives where copies exist.</p> \n<p>The result, not for the first time, is an absurd situation in which the most senior decision-making body concerning the fate of archival documents orders their censorship, but anyone who knows about their existence in the archives can view them.</p> \n<p>Enter the Akevot Institute for Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Research, which catalogs information about the conflict and works to promote human rights. Two years ago it located the Riftin report – open and accessible to everyone – in the Yad Tabenkin Archives of the United Kibbutz Movement. But at the end of last year, when Akevot asked the military censor for authorization to publish the report, it encountered a delay. After a two-month wait, Akevot received a copy of the report but with each page circled and the word “Restricted” stamped on it.</p> \n<p>In other words, publication was banned until a final decision by the military censor. Since then, despite repeated requests, the censor has yet to decide whether to let Akevot publish the 70-year-old document.</p> \n<p>“Because it’s a document from the pre-state period, we assumed that no delay was to be expected,” says Lior Yavne, Akevot’s executive director. “But for the past eight months we’ve been trying unsuccessfully to get an answer from them.”</p> \n<p>Unprofessional conduct</p> \n<p>Poles were not the only ones executed without due process by the Haganah on the eve of Israel’s creation. The Riftin report also refers to a Sudanese man who was arrested in Tel Aviv, interrogated and executed without being charged. The report also mentions a number of Arabs who were executed by Jews. One of them, the report states, was a taxi driver from Tiberias, who “was kidnapped by a Palmach unit together with his car. Put to death.” His car was later used by the organization’s undercover unit that impersonated Arabs, the mistaravim.</p> \n<p>The report contains several versions of this case. “The mistaravim unit hired an Arab taxi [driver] from Tiberias in order to hijack his car for their operational needs,” the document states. “Their intention was to bind his hands and feet, leave him by the side of the road and make off with the car.”</p> \n<p>According to one account, during the journey, when the driver thought that his passengers were ordinary Arabs, he boasted to them that he was active in the “gangs,” as the report puts it. Hearing this, the mistaravim wanted “to take him prisoner for interrogation – but he resisted forcefully, opened the door and wanted to jump out, and our people were forced to liquidate him.”</p> \n<p>According to a different account, “They kidnapped a taxi driver in Tiberias with his car. On the way they injected him with morphine, but the injections didn’t work . They put him in the trunk but he started pounding, and then they were forced, at the top of the hill, to shoot him three times.”</p> \n<p>Another brutal case occurred at Kibbutz Nir Am in the Negev. “A case of the interrogation of an Arab by unauthorized persons, with cruel torture, and his execution amid abuse,” the report states. “He was tortured there was harsh torture (his genital organ was clasped with pliers) . His head was smashed against a wall . The Arab lay in a pit, was shot and covered over.”</p> \n<p>The report also cites complaints about looting – of goods from both Arabs and Jews – by Haganah people. “Items of food being transported to settlements in the Negev are gorged by people escorting the convoys,” it says. In other cases, “money is stolen from Arabs” and there are “complaints of theft of Arab property in fields, orchards and warehouses.”</p> \n<p>Beyond these specific accounts, the Riftin report is important because it was a factor in the decision to establish the military advocate general’s unit. The report’s conclusions include a recommendation to improve the legal system and a ban on executions (other than in cases of rulings by authorized courts).</p> \n<p>“It is therefore essential to create immediately the position of general prosecutor of the organization, who will be responsible for implementing the investigative mechanism and bringing matters to trial,” the report states.</p> \n<p>One can only wonder why the military censor is preventing Akevot from publishing this document. To begin with, it’s not clear how state security could be compromised by the publication of a document dating from the pre-state period. Second, given that the report exists in a number of archives and is available to anyone who searches for it – what is gained by preventing publication?</p> \n<p>Also, a summary of the document’s most interesting sections was published in 2010 in a Ph.D. thesis filed at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It is accessible to everyone.</p> \n<p>Much has been written about this chaos in which, for example, in some cases a document is censored by an entity such as the state archives and is accessible elsewhere, such as on the website of the IDF and Defense Establishment Archives.</p> \n<p>In addition, the censors (at both the state and the military archives) are too prone to blue-pencil documents or sections of them only because they might embarrass the state or show it in a negative light. Akevot’s people say the story of the Riftin report is part of a larger effort to prevent the publication of archival material about harm inflicted by Israelis on innocent people from 1948 to the present day.</p> \n<p>Currently, for example, a military court is considering the request by historian Adam Raz to publish classified documents on the massacre of residents of the Israeli-Arab village of Kafr Qasem by the Border Police in 1956. In the past, the public was also denied access to documents pertaining to the Deir Yassin massacre of 1948.</p> \n<p>In all these and other cases, even though the information has been made public in the media and in historical literature, the state strives to block the publication of archival material about various incidents, citing security reasons and damage to Israel’s foreign relations.</p> \n<p>“The result is the falsification of history and the prevention of a fact- and document-based discussion of our recent history,” says Yavne, the Akevot director. By concealing such documents or preventing their publication, he notes, the state is blocking a discussion on serious events in the history of the Israeli state and society, including “war crimes perpetrated by IDF soldiers and defense officials over the course of years, including in the pre-state period.”</p>",

After all, you’re so suited to one another. I have no doubt that Bibi would be happy to leave his home already today in order to marry you, but apparently that won’t work (the Chief Rabbinate).

The evidence is too strong. Below are a few lines from the speech you delivered to your electorate on March 15, 2017:</p> \n<p>“We are fighting an enemy that is different from us. Not open, but hiding; not straightforward but crafty; not honest but base; not national but international; does not believe in working but speculates with money; does not have its own homeland but feels it owns the whole world.&quot;</p> \n<p>Bravo, Viktor Orban. Josef Goebbels would be proud of you. You didn’t miss a single anti-Semitic clich&eacute;: crafty, without conscience, internationalists, speculators, without a homeland, think that they own the whole world and we’ll continue. In a festive speech on June 21, 2017 you exonerated Admiral Miklos Horthy. “An outstanding statesman,” you called the man who ruled Hungary from 1920 to 1944. A declared anti-Semite, an ally of Hitler, a legislator of anti-Semitic racist laws, a silent supporter of the murderers of the Arrow Cross Party, who slaughtered tens of thousands of Jews, and full party to the deportation of about half a million Hungarian Jews to the crematoria of Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israeli ambassador to U.S. praises Hungary for 'zero tolerance to anti-Semitism'&nbsp;■&nbsp;Zeroing in on Soros, Netanyahu stands shoulder to shoulder with anti-Semitic scum || Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu's silence on son's inflammatory anti-Semitic cartoon is deafening || Editorial &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>And for dessert, your anti-Semitic campaign against George Soros. The Jew. The Hungarian. The philanthropist. One of the century’s great men of conscience. He gives billions of dollars of his wealth to promote open society and combat racism, to promote free thought and combat ultranationalism, to promote freedom and combat tyranny, to promote everything that you despise and combat everything that you represent. It’s no wonder that you and Bibi hate him so much.</p> \n<p>That’s why there’s no point in denial, Mr. Orban. You’re an anti-Semite. A perfect anti-Semite. A Jew hater, an Arab hater.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, among your advisers there may have been one person, who, knowing your taste in nations discreetly warned you that Israel is actually infested with Jews. Don’t worry, these are not Jews of the type you despise. Only very few “Soroses” have remained here On the other hand, we have masses of Judaites. They call themselves Jews, but in fact they are far more similar to your electorate. And if you conduct an open, heart-to-heart discussion with them, you’ll really feel at home.</p> \n<p>Thanks to them, Israel already deserves to be called “The Hungary of the Middle East.” Although, just between us, in the race to the bottom of the barrel we are leading by a considerable margin: We are more racist and less democratic, more ultranationalist and less enlightened, more evil and less sane. In brief, we are already now what you will be soon.</p> \n<p>And still, there’s something positive that we can derive from your visit: Israelis will benefit from an experience like that of a leper who sees himself in the mirror for the first time. “My God!” he will mutter to himself in horror, “Is that what I look like??”</p> \n<p>Yes. It is. Only a little worse.</p>",

They headed to Bethlehem and Hebron to see the occupation for themselves with Breaking the Silence.</p> \n<p>Sunday, another group of eight participants left their Birthright trip during a visit to Jerusalem's City of David,&nbsp;to conduct a solidarity visit with a&nbsp;Palestinian family slated for eviction from their home.</p> \n<p>Birthright has responded to the frustration of millennial American Jews by emphasizing that it is apolitical, and serves to deepen Jewish identity, not educate about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>But choosing to sidestep the conflict is a political move in itself. And at a moment when American Jews are more divided than ever about Israel’s 51-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, it is a stance that is neither sustainable nor inclusive.</p> \n<p>While it’s common to hear that younger American Jews are less connected to Israel than any previous generation, data show the opposite: millennial American Jews are more connected to Israel than previous generations, but they are also more critical of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. Dov Waxman calls this &quot;critical engagement,&quot;&nbsp;and it should interest Birthright. It suggests that creating community between Israeli and American Jews is not served by preventing younger American Jews from asking critical questions about Israeli policy.</p> \n<p>The distinction between &quot;critical engagement&quot; and hatred for Israel is often lost on those with a more traditional view.</p> \n<p>As the five Birthright participants left the trip, their guide yelled after them, &quot;You came to bash Israel. You didn’t come to learn about Israel, you came to learn about Palestine.&quot; &quot;We came to learn,&quot; one young woman replied. For them, that meant meeting Palestinians as well as Israelis.</p> \n<p>Watching this exchange on Facebook Live, I was reminded of my own Birthright experience. In 2012, I headed to JFK eager to join a Birthright program I had been told was designed for curious liberal arts students. It never occurred to me that sincere questions would be treated as a threat.</p> \n<p>The first time I asked about the conflict, my guide voiced the old cliche, &quot;The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.&quot; Later questions about the conflict, no matter their specifics, received the same answer. When several of our group asked whether we were driving through the West Bank, the trip leader told us, &quot;It doesn’t matter.&quot; When I asked an IDF soldier if she had ever talked to a Palestinian, she asked why I was on &quot;the Arab side.&quot;</p> \n<p>The most disturbing moment of the trip came at the top of Masada. Our trip leader began to describe fond memories of an Italian-American neighbor from Staten Island. &quot;But if I had to choose,&quot; he said, suddenly earnest, &quot;between her life and the life of a Jew I have never met, I would choose the Jew. If I had to choose between the lives of my 10 best non-Jewish friends and one Jew I’ve never met, I would choose the Jew.&quot;</p> \n<p>At this, even the more conservative participants seemed uncomfortable. But the guide upped the ante further. &quot;If I had to choose between 10,000 non-Jews and one Jewish life, I would choose the Jewish life.&quot;</p> \n<p>Our trip leader’s eyes narrowed and he leaned closer to us, like an overzealous football coach delivering a pep talk. &quot;Do you remember the tsunami in Asia a few years ago? It killed 100,000. If I had to choose between all those people or one Jewish life, I would choose the Jewish life.&quot;</p> \n<p>I am sure Yossi Beilin, champion of Oslo and architect of Birthright, would be as appalled by this as our Birthright group was. This episode was extreme, but the Masada speech made explicit the implicit message of our Birthright program: enjoy swimming in the Mediterranean, wandering Ben Yehuda Street, and learning about Israel’s success in high tech, but don’t worry about those who live here who are not Jewish.</p> \n<p>It’s an approach Birthright reinforced last November when it ceased meetings with Palestinian citizens of Israel.</p> \n<p>Birthright left me eager to meet those who live in Israel-Palestine but were not included in our program. After spending time in the West Bank, Palestinian communities in Israel, and parts of Israel not included in Birthright, I co-founded Extend in 2013. Participants meet Palestinian civil society activists in Ramallah and Hebron. We learn about the civil disobedience movement in Nabi Saleh and Bil’in. We meet with Palestinian citizens of Israel in Kafr Qasim and Lod. We meet with Israeli organizations that don’t make it onto Birthright itineraries, such as Breaking the Silence, Meretz, B’Tselem, and Rabbis for Human Rights.</p> \n<p>By openly showing Israelis and Palestinians struggling together for human rights, co-existence, and justice, we are trying to introduce young American Jews to an Israel-Palestine in which they see their own values. Participants leave feeling more deeply connected to Israel-Palestine and more determined to advocate for a just future for all.</p> \n<p>After the five Birthright participants left their trip, a Haaretz headline declared, &quot;Between Adelson and BDS, Birthright has become a political battlefield.&quot; But Birthright does not have to choose between the hard-right agenda of the Trump-Netanyahu-Adelson alliance or the BDS camp.</p> \n<p>It can choose instead to meet young American Jews where they are: deeply connected to Israel, but also concerned for its Palestinian neighbors, who do not yet share the freedom Israelis enjoy.</p> \n<p>Sam Sussman is co-founder and director of Extend.</p>",

        "text":["<p>If Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon isn’t careful, his lovely smile revealing his glistening white teeth, which has become his trademark, is likely to become the symbol of Jewish supremacy.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Contrary to what political advisers claim, not everything is subject to being “manufactured.” Just ask Netta Barzilai. Can the Israeli winner of this year’s Eurovision song contest prevent the fact that the video clip of her song “Toy” will always be associated in disgrace with the slaughter on the Gaza border during that period? That’s exactly what is likely to happen to Kahlon if the proposed nation-state bill, which legalizes Jewish supremacy and Arab inferiority, passes thanks to him.</p> \n<p>Kahlon is walking a thin line. He sees himself as the future leader of Likud and is trying to withstand the wave of ultranationalism on which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the prince of the ultranationalist high tide and the depths of racism, is deftly surfing. It probably warms the prime minister’s heart to see Kahlon betraying those same exalted values about which Kahlon spoke when he formed his Kulanu party. It probably gives Netanyahu great pleasure to see Kahlon losing his independence, toeing the line like a rank-and-file Likudnik.</p> \n<p>Nor is the Knesset opposition making Kahlon’s life easy. The finance minister has to sustain much of the criticism that has been directed at the government since its formation. But there’s something unfair in the fact that Kulanu, a centrist party that has always tried to distance itself from confrontation and to promote a social agenda, is being forced to deal with angry calls for it to leave the government and to bring it down. People who didn’t vote for Kahlon have demanded that he resign in their name. Will they vote for him in the next election if he brings down the government “for them”?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The Jewish nation-state bill alienates Israel’s Arab citizens for nothing || Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>That’s unfair, just as it’s unfair that Barzilai’s song is identified with the killing of civilians from Gaza. But that’s how it is. There’s nobody to turn to except Kahlon. The entire opposition has been pulled far to the right, and it doesn’t look like its members have enough strength to row (back) to a safe democratic shore. Whom can the opposition turn to?</p> \n<p>The critics on the left who claim that the nation-state bill reflects reality — destroying the illusion of democracy and equality practiced in Israel (certainly within the Green Line) — are correct. If there is any hope during this bad period, it’s that only when Israelis are longer able to boast about the justice of their laws when racism and discrimination are running rampant, only when Israelis are unable to convince the world and themselves that the regime in Israel is democratic — because the truth will be in black and white on the statute books — that they will demand the elimination of discrimination and the establishment of just government.</p> \n<p>But none of those critics would go so far as calling on opponents of the law to vote for it. Criticism is important, but the opposition must position itself between de facto and de jure realities — that same space that the settler-annexationist-ultranationalist right is trying to constrict — and prevent them becoming one and the same.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'Racist and discriminatory: U.S. Jewish leaders warn Israel against passage of nation-state bill&nbsp;■&nbsp;Explained: The controversial bill that would allow Jewish-only communities in Israel&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The gap between reality and the law embodies not only the illusion that Israel is still a democracy that practices equality but also the hope that some day it will really do so. If the Knesset finds the political strength to prevent the extreme right from carrying out its evil ultranationalist plans, that would be an achievement for it. And such an achievement would for the first time signal a new ideological boundary, changing the political map.</p> \n<p>There is a reason why Netanyahu has been steamrolling the coalition recently. It’s important for him that he go on a strict ideological diet before the summer Knesset recess, to show off the extreme right-wing contours of the government he heads and, most importantly, to fit into his election suit.</p> \n<p>But how far to the right is Kahlon willing to sink? Is he willing to take the risk that when people the world over think of Israeli apartheid, they will picture Kahlon smiling ear to ear? The finance minister’s support for the law will stand out in light of his actual ideological opposition to it. With one vote, he will distort the meaning of his party’s name, transforming “Kulanu” (all of us) to “All of us except the Arabs.”</p>",

The ice cream is made from an Italian recipe, in an Italian machine, from the dairy’s fresh cow’s and goat’s milk and local yogurt.</p> \n<p>Flavors: sheep’s milk yogurt with blueberries; Oreo; nectarine, watermelon and mint or pineapple-coriander sorbet. The toppings are generous.</p> \n<p>Jacobs Dairy Farm, Kfar Haroeh</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Great ice cream: Buza</p> \n<p>The first Buza (Arabic for ice cream) was established six years ago.

In truth the heady flavor of mastica, the resin from the mastic (pistachio) tree, which is very common in Greece, is all you need. That’s why there are only three flavors.</p> \n<p>42 Gibor St., Shfaram</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Uri Buri’s ice cream: Endomela</p> \n<p>Endomela is a small, modest but terrific ice cream parlor in Acre, opened by Uri Jeremias, the man behind the nearby Uri Buri fish restaurant. It began with a small workshop where they made the ice cream served in the restaurant, but due to the great demand they opened an ice cream shop, with a small but excellent and surprising selection.</p> \n<p>Flavors: nut halvah; salted caramel; cinnamon, rose or cardamom and dates; sorbets include mandarin orange, orange and red grapefruit.</p> \n<p>Hahagana, the lighthouse plaza on the western promenade, Acre</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Homemade and high-quality: Eissalon</p> \n<p>On the second floor of a commercial center in Haifa’s Savyonei Danya neighborhood in, you’ll find Eissalon, opened by Adva Barak-Liani and her husband Sion. Adva fell in love with ice cream making in Germany, studied in Bologna, and the couple returned to Israel and about a year ago opened the shop.

The reasonable price is surprising in light of the excellence of the ice cream.</p> \n<p>Flavors: labneh and za’atar; Austrian wheat beer; poppy seed, marzipan and Amarena cherry; sorbets include blueberry, chocolate, lemon and basil or orange and mint.</p> \n<p>7 Oskar Schindler St., Haifa</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pink parlor from the R2M Group: Cr&egrave;me</p> \n<p>On northern Dizengoff Street a small ice cream parlor from the R2M Group opened a month ago, with fresh ice cream combined with fragrant pastries. It offers only four flavors, but it is not to be missed.</p> \n<p>Flavors: vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, mango sorbet. You can turn the ice cream into a small dessert such as “apple pie” (vanilla ice cream with caramelized apples and streusel), or a dessert that is like a lemon meringue pie, among others.</p> \n<p>262 Dizengoff St., Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pride of Givatayim and Ramat Gan: Freezer</p> \n<p>Tal Fernheimer and Eran Prizant are two childhood friends from Givatayim who love ice cream. The former is a Cordon Bleu chef and the latter a lawyer. Four years ago they opened Freezer in Givatayim, and a year ago they opened a branch in Ramat Gan.</p> \n<p>Flavors: apple ricotta crumble; poppy seed cream; halvah, honey and tahini.

There they produce homemade Sicilian ice cream and granita. There’s a large selection, made from fresh ingredients only.</p> \n<p>Flavors: a wonderful bread and butter ice cream or Arte cake, a cheesecake with berries and almond crumble.</p> \n<p>11 Nahalat Binyamin St., Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Emek Hefer’s ice cream: Dida</p> \n<p>Ten years ago the Dida boutique ice cream parlor was established at the Ruppin interchange, with fresh ice cream produced daily using traditional methods. There is now another branch in Kibbutz Yakum. The ice cream maker is Vered Ben Yakar, who every day produces a large number of flavors. Including pastry flavors such as tiramisu and malabi.</p> \n<p>Flavors: yogurt with seeds and honey; birthday ice cream; marshmallow; rum raisin, sugar-free white chocolate.</p> \n<p>Paz gas station, Ruppin interchange; Yakum commercial center.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>100 Shades of sweet: Aglida</p> \n<p>In the Ramat Yishai industrial zone you will find Aglida.

Since then the shop has wandered among the alleyways in Mahaneh Yehuda and two years ago it landed on Ha’armonim Street, with another place downtown.</p> \n<p>Flavors: The most popular is coffee. There are also unique flavors like black sesame, aromatic saffron and chai masala. Sorbet: grapefruit and basil; cherry, coconut or mango.</p> \n<p>2 Ha’armonim St., Jerusalem</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fine Italian: Mimi</p> \n<p>The Nono Italian restaurant is in Hod Hasharon’s Sportan sports complex. There was always homemade gelato, and now there’s Mimi, a cafe-bakery-ice cream parlor.</p> \n<p>Flavors: caramel with Rice Crispies; vegan marzipan; mascarpone and Amarena cherries; sugar-free Madagascar vanilla. Sorbets: pear with chocolate pearls, peach, mango.</p> \n<p>2 Jabotinsky St., Hod Hasharon</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The best: Glidat Be’er Sheva</p> \n<p>In 1950, when most Israeli ice cream was made with vegetable fat, Yulia Rotenberg used cream. A partner in a Viennese ice cream factory, she fled to Israel and turned the ground floor of her Be’er Sheva home into an ice cream shop. Once there were branches throughout Israel, now there are six — with unforgettable ice cream.</p> \n<p>Flavors: The original Be’er Sheva location has a huge variety: carrot yogurt, vanilla nut raisin, Russian cream, blueberry yogurt.</p> \n<p>50 Hadassah St., Be’er Sheva</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The closest to Italy: Otello</p> \n<p>You could think you were in Italy. A large ice cream parlor with Italian ice cream made with cream, very soft and smooth, with innovative flavors. The owners, Matan Sela and Guy Baron, also make chocolate and other sweets.</p> \n<p>Flavors: milk cream, salted caramel, unbelievable pistachio.

        "text":["<p>Of all countries to spearhead a global drive to combat global warming, Pakistan is possibly the worst equipped. But it may also be among the most motivated.</p> \n<p>Pakistan is already among the countries worst hit by climate change, if the criteria is unbearable heat. In April, the town of Nawabshah experienced a temperature of 50.2&ordm; Celsius (122.4&ordm; Fahrenheit) in the shade – the hottest temperature ever recorded anywhere in the world for that month. In May, doctors advised the public to wear light-colored clothing to reflect sunlight and Karachiites begged the city to set up heatstroke shelters.</p> \n<p>Food security in the Indian subcontinent depends on the monsoon, which may diminish as global warming intensifies, scientists warn. This year at least, the monsoon is expected to be “as usual,” says a source in Pakistan.</p> \n<p>But Pakistan is already running a significant water deficit and the forecast for the Indian subcontinent, which houses a fifth of the world’s population, is grim. And the people sense the change and are afraid.</p> \n<p>Faisal lives in north Karachi and works in the city’s south, which is a long trip to make daily. “The major anomaly we have witnessed recently, regarding climate change, is that there is no rain in the entire city at once. One area gets wet and another is completely dry and warm,” he says: precipitation patterns are changing. “Water shortage, especially during heat waves, is the aspect killing us the most. The dust in the air makes it uncomfortable to breathe deeply,” Faisal says.</p> \n<p>A recent HSBC report ranked India as the country most vulnerable to climate change, Pakistan second and Bangladesh fourth. (Israel is 63rd.)</p> \n<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has created climate change scenarios based on projected trends and rates of industrialization, energy use and population growth, explains Prof. Steve Brenner of Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan. The panel refers to its scenarios as “representative concentration pathways” (RCPs).</p> \n<p>The “stop all emissions” scenario, RCP-2.6, assumes that greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2020 and vanish by 2080; the average global temperature may rise by 0.3&ordm; to 1.7&ordm; Celsius by 2100, Brenner explains.</p> \n<p>The intermediate scenario, RCP-4.5, assumes emissions peak in 2050 and then decline; the projected temperature increase&nbsp;is 1.1&ordm; to 2.6&ordm; Celsius.</p> \n<p>The worst-case scenario, RCP-8.5, assumes emissions rise even faster, more than doubling by 2100. The projected temperature increase is 2.6&ordm; to 4.8&ordm; Celsius.</p> \n<p>Those figures are projected global averages. In Pakistan and the subcontinent, by 2100 the annual mean temperature is expected to rise by anywhere from at least 3&deg;C and up to 6&deg;C.</p> \n<p>In August 2017, Pakistan inaugurated a Ministry of Climate Change and gave it $70 million for that year and 2018, out of the national budget of $51&nbsp;billion. Less impressively, that funding was quickly slashed to less than $7 million for 2018-2019.</p> \n<p>Pressed by reporters, Mushahidullah Khan – who headed the ministry until May (when the government term expired) – explained that the ministry’s mandate is to make policy, not execute it. Pakistan is allocating 8 percent of its budget to address climate change, he said. But when asked about concrete achievements during his short term, all Khan noted was building work commencing on a botanical garden in Islamabad and work on the ministry’s website.</p> \n<p>Islamabad at least isn’t denying that climate change is a thing, as some in the West do. The question is what it can do, and will do.</p> \n<p>Recurrent catastrophe</p> \n<p>Throughout the subcontinent extreme weather is becoming more frequent, including deadly cyclones, storms and floods. (Drought isn’t considered an “extreme weather event,” just a catastrophe.)</p> \n<p>Pakistan’s average mean temperature has risen by 0.5&deg;C in the last 50 years, says a 2017 report by the Asia Development Bank. Hot days are hotter, and the number of heat-wave days per year in Pakistan jumped fivefold in the last 30 years.</p> \n<p>In humid conditions, sweat can’t evaporate and the body can’t cool down, so the survivable heat level is lower. In two decades, the think tank Germanwatch estimates, more than 10,000 Pakistanis died from extreme weather.</p> \n<p>For 2016, Germanwatch’s Global Climate Risk Index ranked India as the sixth-worst sufferer from extreme weather and Pakistan 40th (the worst hit was Haiti, followed by Zimbabwe.) But over two decades, from 1997 to 2016, the index ranks Pakistan’s climate change suffering in seventh place and India in 12th.</p> \n<p>By 2100, summer heat and humidity in the subcontinent are expected to reach unsurvivable levels. Dipping into the sea to cool off is evidently not going to be the answer because the seawater itself is warming – or because of its befoulment with sewage.</p> \n<p>A tough neighborhood</p> \n<p>The problems of Pakistan start with the present climatic ravages and the shortcomings of government, compounded by inability and lack of resources. And then there’s the neighborhood.</p> \n<p>Since 2010, the Indian economy has doubled in size. Even if you suspect the numbers are as cooked as a curry, India’s sheer scale and growing demand for energy render it crucial to the climate change story. It is expected to become the biggest contributor to global warming – passing the United States and China – as its economic development and population growth ramp up the demand for energy, and emissions.</p> \n<p>Not only are Pakistan, India and Bangladesh in the same flimsy boat: It’s adding insult to injury for Islamabad that its nemesis is blowing smoke, from emissions and burning mountains of garbage, right into its face (or that of Bangladesh, on India’s eastern side).</p> \n<p>All three are spectacularly unequipped to invest heavily in means to combat climate change. Pakistan’s GDP per capita is about $1,470, somewhat under India’s and just over that of Bangladesh. All are plagued by lip service to governance.</p> \n<p>Assuming India and its 1.4 billion people don’t volunteer to revert to the Stone Age in order to spare the planet, the Financial Times estimated that over the next 20 years, India alone will become responsible for almost all the increase in total global emissions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Pakistan can’t change that any more than you could save a burning office tower by tossing your cup of coffee at it. What Pakistan could feasibly do is alleviate local distress, which will take more than lip service and building botanical gardens.</p> \n<p>There are three things thirsty countries like Pakistan need to do, spells out Uri Schor, spokesman of the Israel Water Authority: prevent waste (the world loses vast amounts of freshwater to leakage and silly use); prevent water theft; and teach people to water economy.</p> \n<p>That means changing the mind-set. Umair is a banker who works in the field: he rides his bike around Karachi to reach his clients. “Is it in our hands to change the climate of Karachi? I don’t know even if it is possible to bring an adequate change,” he says. “Things are worse than ever. If we get no water, we complain to the water board. If we get no electricity, we complain to Karachi Electric. But what if the climate is changing? We do not know whom to complain to.”</p> \n<p>It’s easy to blame amorphous authorities for mere lip service. It’s more difficult to accept the need for personal sacrifice. But the basis for change, Schor stresses, lies in public acceptance.</p> \n<p>“People need to understand,” he says. “A nation can’t invest huge amounts in recycling and desalination while the public groans under the burden and doesn’t understand where the money is going. Explain to them – explain how to save water, be more efficient.”</p> \n<p>Thirsty in Karachi</p> \n<p>Pakistan is running dry. The roughly 21 million Karachiites routinely get only half the UN-recommended daily water allocation, a source in the city told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Per capita annual water availability in Pakistan has plunged from 1,500 cubic meters per capita in 2009 to 1,015 cubic meters now, which is on the brink of water scarcity, according to the International Monetary Fund.</p> \n<p>The water deficit isn’t because of desertification or even because of climate change, yet. It’s because of explosive population growth, urbanization, and ecological and resource mismanagement. But the water stress, which both the UN and IMF describe, can only intensify: the population is growing; hotter temperatures means more evaporation from fields and more need for irrigation; and sea-level rise is already causing saltwater intrusion on the coasts.</p> \n<p>Most of Pakistan’s water supply comes from the Indus River, which originates from snow and ice in the Tibetan Plateau and cuts through the country. According to the UN Development Programme, 90 percent of Pakistan’s agriculture depends on this river. What is climate change expected to do to the Himalayan snowpack and glaciers, though?</p> \n<p>“This is a difficult question to answer due to the large uncertainty,” says Brenner. Some project that the Himalayan snowpack and glaciers will shrink faster through this century and possibly disappear entirely in some regions, he says. But the uncertainties are immense, he stresses: In 2010, the IPCC retracted the conclusion reached three years earlier, that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. “They apologized for basing this on poorly substantiated estimates from an unrefereed report,” Brenner adds.</p> \n<p>So, we don’t know what will happen to the snowpack, the glaciers and the immense rivers they feed.</p> \n<p>If there’s good news, it’s that experts don’t necessarily expect climate change to affect rainfall on Pakistan. But they do anticipate that storms will become more intense – which means worse flooding.</p> \n<p>Flooding is just bad news for Pakistan and Bangladesh, which, in contrast to India, have not invested in dams or reservoirs to cache floodwaters and seasonal deluges, say experts. They do not “save” the floodwater for later use.</p> \n<p>In fact, India has been arguing to international watchdogs that it should be allowed to take more water from the mighty Indus – and other rivers that are Pakistan’s fief under a 1960 treaty – because Pakistan is so useless at utilizing them anyway. Islamabad, for its part, has growled back that India is grabbing water from “its” river, the Jhelum. Bangladesh also claims that India is taking more than its share from the Ganges.</p> \n<p>If the Indus flow ebbs, it will be critical for Pakistan’s food and water security. Happily, nobody’s expecting that in the foreseeable future. Long-term, beyond 2050, nobody’s even hazarding a guess because of the sheer complexity of the region, let alone the climate change parameters. But nobody’s expecting improvement, and the sooner Pakistan begins to prepare for the evil day and build infrastructure to cache monsoon rains and floodwater, the better – because Pakistan’s sources of water are not expected to increase but its population is.</p> \n<p>The wrath of God</p> \n<p>Desalinating seawater isn’t a feasible option for thirsty Pakistan either, or even just for Karachi. The huge cost of building desalination plants is just one obstacle. Another is ongoing expenses: desalinating water is energy-expensive. So is adding back essential minerals&nbsp;removed from the water.</p> \n<p>And, the seawater off the Pakistan coast is filthy, Pakistani sources wail. Very little of Pakistan’s sewage, less than 10 percent, gets treated. “The coast here was a popular tourist resort in the 1950s and ’60s,” a source in Karachi told Haaretz. “Celebrities would come from all over the world for a luxury vacation on the sea. Now nobody swims in the water.”</p> \n<p>Truth is, even raw sewage can be treated in desalination plants, explains Schor of the Israel Water Authority. Again, the problem is cost. Treating seawater fouled with sewage means replacing filters a lot. “It’s not only costlier but much harder,” Schor explains. “Ultimately, it’s a question of cost-benefit. Even if I’m filthy rich, if a liter of water costs $300, it becomes irrelevant.” Again Schor stresses the benefit of public education: “Each cubic meter of water saved, saves a cubic meter of desalinated water.”</p> \n<p>There ought to be a law. In fact there is, but there’s no enforcement, the Pakistani Ministry of Agriculture itself admitted in 2012. The only cities treating wastewater at all – less than 8 percent at that – are Islamabad and Karachi, it said. Farmers irrigate with sewage, a recipe for disease. “There seems no national policy in effect on sustainable use of wastewater in this country,” the ministry observed.</p> \n<p>And that hasn’t improved, according to a 2015 paper in the Journal of Water Resource and Protection: “Human health is facing serious problems due to deteriorating drinking water quality. Pakistan has developed many water laws,” but does nothing to enforce them.</p> \n<p>It can’t control Indian emissions, but mismanagement and enforcement are things Pakistan could tackle if the people cooperate.</p> \n<p>The will seems to be developing. Shafiq owns a general store in Karachi’s busiest market, Boltan. “We should pray to God and ask his forgiveness. The warm weather is because of our wrong deeds. Our leaders are corrupt. That’s why we are facing the wrath in the form of extreme weather,” Shafiq says.</p> \n<p>Sinking underwater</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, sea levels on the Pakistani coast have risen by 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the last 100 years, says the Asia Development Bank report. By 2100 the sea is expected to rise by 60 centimeters more – and that’s not factoring in land sinkage due to groundwater exploitation, the weight of buildings and more.</p> \n<p>In 2015, Pakistan’s Standing Committee on Science and Technology shrieked that the riverside cities of Badin and Thatta could disappear underwater within 30 years – followed by Karachi itself by 2060. Yet Badin and Thatta are both inland. “These cities, as well as Karachi, are located in low-lying regions that are related to the Indus River valley and delta,” explains Brenner. “Continued sea-level rise and erosion of the delta, together with unplanned coastal development, are causing the sea to intrude into these regions,” he adds.</p> \n<p>Mitigating the threats Pakistan faces from climate change alone will require a “concerted effort by the government and civil society at all levels,” the Asian Development Bank points out.</p> \n<p>Schor seconds that: Water economy is crucial to future survival and it is urgent to talk with the people (and fix leaks).</p> \n<p>The alternative is to continue creating paper ministries as temperatures and sea levels creep up, the megacities run dry or sink into the sea, and starvation spreads as crops fail. The future of the Himalayan snowcap may be obscure, but the trajectory of the subcontinent is not.</p> \n<p>Pakistan can’t save the world unless it suddenly decides to and becomes extraordinarily persuasive, but it can save its people from a lot of distress. If it decides to.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After a whirlwind 48-hour trip to Israel in which he told Israeli leaders of Diaspora Jewry’s distress over the controversial nation-state bill, Jerry Silverman said he was leaving the country “disappointed.”</p> \n<p>Silverman, president and CEO of the Jewish Federations of North America, told Haaretz Monday that despite last-minute changes to the draft law, he was still deeply concerned over the current version of the legislation, which would legally define Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>“The nation-state bill in its current form falls short of the expectations we have of Israel, a thriving democracy,” he said. “We appreciate that members of the Knesset and other leaders were open to listening to our concerns. However, the bill as is is still disappointing.”</p> \n<p>The concerns of Diaspora leaders, including Silverman (who heads the umbrella body of community Jewish philanthropies across the United States), are focused on several contentious clauses.</p> \n<p>The first of these is a clause that originally read: “The state will work to preserve the special connection between [Israel] and the Jewish people everywhere.” Following pressure from ultra-Orthodox parties last week, that wording was then changed to read: “The state will work in the Diaspora to preserve the special connection between [Israel] and the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>The government’s approval to changing the clause by removing “everywhere” and specifying “Diaspora” is viewed as an effort to ensure that the bill, if it passes and becomes a Basic Law, cannot be interpreted as ensuring Jewish religious pluralism in Israel. This could potentially affect High Court of Justice rulings on hot-button Israel-Diaspora issues like conversion, marriage and prayer arrangements at the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>“The language is patronizing and makes clear that Israel is responsible for the unity of the Jewish people in the Diaspora only,” Silverman said. “We are disappointed that the change [by the ultra-Orthodox parties] was accepted and would make it into the final bill.</p> \n<p>“We feel this way not only because it will have a negative effect on Diaspora Jewry, but because it will have a negative effect on Israel,” Silverman added.</p> \n<p>Another clause causing concern is the one that originally said the state would allow groups to establish separate communities “on the basis of religion and nationality,” thus enabling the establishment of Jewish-only communities.</p> \n<p>Following widespread criticism from many political figures – including President Reuven Rivlin – and legal experts, a compromise on the wording was reached among coalition members. The clause now reads: “The state sees developing Jewish communities as a national value and will act to encourage, promote and establish them.”</p> \n<p>But North American Jewish leaders remain unhappy with this new draft. They also believe the very public debate over the original segregated communities clause – which highlighted that key coalition parties endorsed blatant discrimination – damaged Israel’s image internationally.</p> \n<p>Another clause Jewish leaders object to would downgrade Arabic from an official language to one having “special status” in Israel. Here, too, Diaspora leaders believe that passage of the bill as it stands would create negative perceptions worldwide of state-sanctioned discrimination against nearly a quarter of the country’s population.</p> \n<p>Silverman said he was grateful for “the opportunity to meet with different leaders in the Knesset, ministers and people from the Prime Minister’s Office, expressing our opinion on areas of the bill we found challenging.”</p> \n<p>He said he was not able to “directly” meet and speak with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but spoke with officials in his office.</p> \n<p>Asked if he believed North American Jewry opposed the bill in its entirety, Silverman responded, “Israel is a sovereign nation. I’m not going to be critical of the total bill.”</p> \n<p>He added, “How can I oppose, for example, a clause stating that ‘Hatikva’ is the national anthem? What I am challenged by are those aspects of the bill that could have indirect consequences for the Diaspora.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said Monday that the government intends to pass the nation-state bill by Wednesday, when the Knesset closes for its summer recess.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Sacha Baron Cohen was first making a name for himself as faux white rapper Ali G in the late 1990s, making fools of B-list celebrities with his dumbass interviews, another British provocateur was really going for the jugular: Chris Morris’ “Brass Eye” was jaw-droppingly good television, where he got celebrities and politicians to solemnly pronounce on some completely made-up danger to society. In an episode looking at drugs in Britain, he found a disturbingly high number of familiar faces to speak out against the perils of the fictitious narcotic “Cake,” even getting one Conservative politician to ask questions about it in Parliament.</p> \n<p>I can pay Baron Cohen’s new Showtime comedy no greater compliment than saying there is one particular sketch in “Who is America?” in which I was reminded of “Brass Eye.” But I was also disappointed that the 10-minute segment at the end of the first episode – in which Israeli “terrorist terminator” Col. Erran Morad goes to Washington, pushing his idea to arm 4-year-olds in kindergartens – was the only sketch that truly merited the enormous lengths to which the comedian and his team have gone to dupe Americans into appearing on camera.</p> \n<p>There were two interesting things about the announcement earlier this month that Baron Cohen was returning to star in his first TV show since 2004: First, as the likes of David Bowie and Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z have shown in recent years, it’s surprisingly easy to keep high-profile projects under wraps if you really want; and, second, are oddball segments for the likes of batshit crazy websites like “InfoWars” so prevalent nowadays that it’s become easier than ever to dupe politicians into appearing on screen for some completely random show?</p> \n<p>“Who is America?” nails its colors to the mast in the opening credits, as JFK and Reagan are shown delivering presidential addresses, while Donald Trump is shown mocking a reporter with a disability. Folks, it doesn’t get any subtler than this. Baron Cohen’s comedy hero was Peter Sellers, and while the Jewish comedian shares the former’s amazing ability to transform himself into a variety of characters, he also shares his love of a crude joke. Put simply, the show veers between the satirical brilliance of “Dr. Strangelove” and the scatological humor of the latter-day “Pink Panther” movies, making for an at-times frustrating watch.</p> \n<p>Of the four sketches in the opening show, I’d rate one as a timely yet timeless comedy masterpiece; one a very funny if morally dubious piece lampooning the art world; one an overextended joke that has a certain car-crash appeal to it; and one a big disappointment.</p> \n<p>The latter is the interview with “Bernard Sanders,” in which Truthbrary.org founder Billy Wayne Ruddick explains to the bemused Vermont senator how the 99 percent can join the 1 percent to become the 199 percent. The moustachioed, fair-haired, corpulent “journalist” also asks Sanders about the Affordable Care Act: “ObamaCare doesn’t work,” he explains. “I mean, I know personally. I was a healthy man, then ObamaCare came in. I was forced to see a doctor and suddenly I have three diseases.” Cut to Sanders’ sudden eye movement as if searching for the nearest exit door.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The problem here is it’s never clear who the butt of the joke is. It’s definitely not Sanders, who escapes with his dignity intact and concludes with the honest admission, “Billy, I have no idea what you’re talking about, I really don’t.” And someone like Billy is almost beyond a joke because the type of character he is based on is already a parody.</p> \n<p>The next sketch features an NPR sweatshirt-wearing, ponytail-sporting liberal (“a cis gender, white heterosexual male – for which I apologize”) cycling across America in order to “heal the divide” – which isn’t exactly the hardest target to hit. To do this he visits the opulent home of a South Carolina Trump couple “who suffer from white privilege.” As they dine, he introduces more and more outrageous ideas (including having his newly menstruating young daughter, Malala, “free bleed” on a U.S. flag as a sanitary towel). The Republican couple bear all of this with remarkable sanguinity, which ultimately begs the question of what the hell they thought they were signing up to.</p> \n<p>Peak crudity arrives in a segment in which a British ex-con presents his unique art forms to the fine art consultant at a swanky gallery in Laguna Beach. These works, he explains, were borne from a “dirty protest” he staged while in prison, giving a whole new meaning to the term “art movement.” Much as I wanted to hate this sketch, I did find myself laughing throughout – although God only knows what Christy the consultant will be feeling as she watches herself make a rather personal offering at the end. I can only hope she sees it as some kind of video installation art.</p> \n<p>The moment of genius finally arrives with the most compelling new character, the Israeli character of Col. Morad (the show is worth watching alone to hear Baron Cohen’s Israeli pronunciations of “NRA” and “Congress”).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;No, Sacha Baron Cohen fans - Israel Does not actually arm preschoolers&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The NRA wants to arm the schoolteachers. This is crazy! You should be arming the children!” says black-clad, bulked up, black-cropped-haired Erran, who appears to be modeled on a G.I. Joe figure. He enlists gun rights activist Philip Van Cleave to his cause for a cartoon called “Kinder Guardians: How to Protect Your Preschool,” which really does need to be seen to be believed.</p> \n<p>But the real stroke of genius comes when Baron Cohen’s character struts through the Capitol Building and meets Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who expresses misgivings about saying on television that he supports giving firearms to 3- and 4-year-olds, noting: “Typically, members of Congress don’t just hear a story about a program and then indicate whether they support it or not.” Cut to the likes of Trent Lott, Dana Rohrabacher, Joe Wilson and Joe Walsh expressing their instant support for the “Kinder Guardians” program. (“A 3-year-old cannot defend itself from an assault rifle by throwing a Hello Kitty pencil case at it,” is Wilson’s particularly scary comment.)</p> \n<p>Of course, this shows us that – as Morris demonstrated 20 years ago – you can pretty much get a politician to say anything on screen if you couch it in the right way for their electorate and make sure they don’t think about it for too long. Yet the most worrying aspect is not that these politicians’ careers will not be shot to pieces despite them spouting such nonsense, but that there are people out there right now probably thinking, “Kinder Guardians? Great idea!”</p> \n<p>“Who is America?” ultimately proves there’s a very thin line between satire and White House policy these days.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Dozens of prominent religious-Zionist and ultra-Orthodox rabbis gathered in a rare joint event in Jerusalem Tuesday, aimed to thwart the conversion bill recently proposed by former senior Likud cabinet minister Moshe Nissim.</p> \n<p>They called on the government to preserve the Chief Rabbinate’s monopoly over conversion in Israel and warned that Nissim’s proposal would divide the nation, sever the Rabbinate from the state and constitute a “sellout” of Judaism and Jewish religious law, or halakha.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, rabbis Yisrael Meir Lau, Reuven Elbaz and members of Israel’s Chief Rabbinical Council joined leading rabbis from the religious Zionist movement, including Shmuel Eliyahu, Shlomo Aviner, Zvi Tau and Dov Lior.</p> \n<p>“Nissim’s recommendations must be buried, and we must forget they were submitted to the cabinet at all,” stated the organizers of the event, called “One Conversion for One People.”</p> \n<p>Nissim headed a committee that recommended establishing a new state-run Orthodox authority — not under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate, which currently has a monopoly on conversions — in order to facilitate and expedite conversions for hundreds of thousands of Israelis.</p> \n<p>“The Rabbinate is the only body authorized to perform conversion,” Yosef said at the event. “We cannot have a person who has nothing to do with conversion matters dictate to us on the matter, without consulting with any rabbi. At first I refused to accept Moshe Nissim. I didn’t know what consultants he surrounded himself with. Unbelievable, everything I told him, he did exactly the opposite.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Orthodox-run authority would get total control over conversions in Israel under new bill&nbsp;■&nbsp;Jewish leaders reject bill that would grant Orthodox movement monopoly over conversions&nbsp;■&nbsp;'The Orthodox conversaion was purely bureaucratic, with nothing behind it'&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said Interior Minister Arye Dery intends to submit a bill under which no private, Orthodox or Reform conversion would be recognized and urged all the rabbis to back this move.</p> \n<p>The rabbis also blasted the idea to allow city rabbis to perform conversions, noting that in the past some rabbis took bribery for conversions. Yosef, who listed in a letter several failures he found in Nissim’s proposal, said “already today most of the conversion judges are religious Zionists, who are more lenient.”</p> \n<p>He said the fact that a man who wasn’t appointed for this by the Chief Rabbinate had been tasked to outline the conversion process was “completely erroneous.”</p> \n<p>Other failures of the proposal, according to the rabbis, were having Reform and Conservative representatives on the conversion judges’ appointments committee and taking the conversion out of the Rabbinate’s hands.</p> \n<p>Two former Sephardi chief rabbis, Shlomo Moshe Amar and Eliyahu Bakshi Doron, also objected to the proposal. Amar sent the rabbis a letter saying Nissim “recommends detaching conversion from the Rabbinate and halakha, and setting up a body to perform a social state conversion in the spirit of halakha deniers.”</p> \n<p>He wrote he was sure Nissim, the son of a former chief rabbi, hadn’t written “this report, and if he did, he must have been greatly misled.” He feared the recommended move would “not only uproot conversion from the rabbinate, but sever the rabbinate from the state.”</p> \n<p>In conclusion, Amar called on the rabbis who had initially approved the proposal to write urgently that their signature was a mistake and revoke it. Bakshi Doron also signed Amar’s letter and added: “It’s a sell-out of halakha, of Judaism.”</p> \n<p>Lior said the bill would divide the nation, “because it will be necessary to set up a separate marriage system. It will ruin the basic structure in Israel. ... Those who care about the nation’s dignity and safety will understand that for the people’s unity they must give it up. The issues of marriage and joining the people of Israel cannot be taken out of the rabbinate’s hands,” he said.</p> \n<p>The organizers issued a statement saying “we hope the gathering’s resolute statement will convey to the public the rabbis’ concern for the state’s Jewish character and the great responsibility of preserving the integrity and Judaism of the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>Nissim said when he submitted his recommendations that the goal of the new law is to stop the growing levels of assimilation in Israel.</p> \n<p>“There are some 400,000 people without a religion in Israel today,” he said, referring to immigrants who moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s and whose Judaism is not recognized by the Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>The organizers of the gathering — Liba Center and the Hotam organization — belong to the religious-Zionist-Haredi stream, which has been playing a major role in state-religion struggles in recent years.</p> \n<p>These organizations spearheaded the struggle on the Western Wall mixed prayer plaza, the grocery stores’ legislation and others. Their rabbis present a hawkish position and drag the ultra-Orthodox public to a more radical position, and to a clash with the general public.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In recent years Russia has staged a comeback in the Mideast, big time, to the extent that it may replace the United States as the leading foreign power in the region.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia’s success results from a combination of both deft diplomacy and weapons and nuclear reactor sales to states throughout the region, from Iran to Morocco. The weakness of American regional policy under the Obama administration, followed by the total chaos under Trump, have further contributed to Russia’s success. Russian policy has been sophisticated, but has also benefited from the void left by the U.S.</p> \n<p>President Vladimir Putin’s fundamental strategic objective is to restore Russian global leadership, or to put it somewhat less delicately, to stick it to the U.S. wherever possible.</p> \n<p>His primary problem is that Russia does not have that much to offer: it cannot compete with the U.S. and Western countries on an economic level, or usually a diplomatic one, and all it does have to offer is weapons, nuclear technology and energy.</p> \n<p>The Middle East is one of the primary regions in the world in which Russia can pursue its ambitions today. Most global weapons sales are with Middle Eastern states and a race is underway among them to procure nuclear power reactors. Moscow’s willingness to sell them weapons and reactors, and to maintain close relations with rogue regimes such as those in Damascus and Teheran, provide it with a degree of influence that it does not have in much of the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>In Syria, with a minimal deployment of two fighter squadrons, Russia succeeded in turning the tide in the civil war, stabilized the Assad regime and defended it from accusations that it had repeatedly used chemical weapons, despite the clear proof that it has done so.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia allowed Iran and its affiliated militias to do the bleeding on the ground in Syria, while it hardly paid any price at all for intervening. In so doing, it has put paid to Obama’s fears of intervention, lest the U.S. become mired in the Syrian quagmire, and his prophecy that Syria would become the Russian Vietnam.</p> \n<p>The fact that Russia is the only player in Syria today that maintains relations with all of the sides involved, has turned it into the leading actor there and the only one that just may be able to bring about a diplomatic resolution of the domestic crisis and prevent a direct conflict between Iran and Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia has also succeeding in ensuring that its presence in Syria, in the Hamimim airbase and Latakia naval base, will be for the long-term. Advanced S300 and S400 air defense systems - manned so far solely by Russian personnel - have been deployed in Syria to defend these bases, which provide Russia with the ability to project power throughout the Middle East.</p> \n<p>In Egypt, after four decades in which Cairo has been aligned entirely with the U.S., Putin succeeded in using the regime’s anger towards Washington that followed Mubarak’s ouster and American sanctions on arms sales to deepen relations. Military ties have been renewed, including the sale of approximately 50 MIG 29 fighters and a similar number of attack helicopters, S300 missiles and joint military exercises.</p> \n<p>The two countries are now cooperating in Libya, including the deployment of a small Russian military force in western Egypt. Last year a deal was concluded for the provision of four Russian nuclear power reactors to Egypt.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia, which has long lived under an American security umbrella, is now afraid to continue placing all of its “strategic eggs” in the American basket and has also improved ties with Russia. The first visit ever of a Saudi king in Russia took place last year, and the crown prince has also visited since then. A deal for the sale of S400 and antitank missiles has been signed, as well as a nuclear cooperation agreement, in preparation for Russian participation in a Saudi tender for the first two out of 16 planned nuclear power reactors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia and Russia, which jointly account for some 20% of the world’s oil production, have also begun investing in joint energy projects and, more importantly, to coordinate moves in order to bring about a cut in the global supply of oil and a price hike.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For decades, Russia has maintained a strategic relationship with Iran. A Security Council resolution prevents resumption of arms sales to Iran until 2020, but talks are underway regarding the sale of fighter aircraft, tanks and artillery and Russia has already supplied Iran with S300 missiles.</p> \n<p>The American withdrawal from the nuclear agreement and its resumption of sanctions, make Iran even more dependent on Moscow. Both strategic and economic cooperation between the two, including a possible free-trade zone, is expanding further.</p> \n<p>Turkey may still go ahead with the purchase of S400 missiles, over the protestations of its NATO allies and despite the threat the deal poses to the future of the alliance. Morocco, Bahrain and Qatar are also interested in the S400. Russia has concluded large arms sales with the UAE and a nuclear cooperation agreement with Tunisia. Russia is now interested in naval bases in Libya.</p> \n<p>Lebanon, too, has become a focus of Russian interest, in the attempt to reduce American influence in that country. Russia has offered Lebanon a large arms sale at zero interest and expressed interest in air and naval bases. Russian firms have also competed for oil and gas exploration tenders in Lebanese territorial waters. Russian weapons have reached Hezbollah, apparently through Syria and/or Iran, without Moscow making a major effort to prevent this.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time that it has deepened ties with Arab states, Russia has also succeeded in establishing a strong relationship with Israel and creating growing Israeli dependence on it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the prospects of a direct Israeli-Iranian conflict, with Hezbollah as well, depend to a large extent today on Moscow. As the only power that has strategic relations with Iran, the crisis over its nuclear program, following the American withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, may provide Russia with a unique role in the efforts to bring the sides back to the table and to reach a &quot;better&quot; deal. It is not for nothing that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made urgent visits to Moscow every few months.</p> \n<p>The U.S. is Israel’s strategic ally, but it has adopted a diminished role on issues of vital importance for Israel’s national security, making Israel increasingly dependent on Moscow. There have been conflicting reports so far regarding Moscow’s willingness to take Israel’s security concerns into account.</p> \n<p>President Trump has sought to disrupt long-established strategic realities everywhere. In the Middle East, he has succeeded in causing not just disruption but mayhem, clearing the way for Russia and Iran to supplant and dominate.</p> \n<p>Chuck Freilich, a senior fellow at Harvard’s Belfer Center and former Israeli deputy national security adviser, is the author of&nbsp;Israeli National Security: A New Strategy for an Era of Change&nbsp;(Oxford University Press, 2018)&nbsp;</p>",

City of David, which Birthright-Israel took the group to visit, is managed by Elad, which is also engaged in Jewish settlement in Silwan and wants the house for that purpose. The organization is expected to receive control over the property if the family is evicted, just as it has in other cases.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why more U.S. Jews will walk off Birthright this summer | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Between Adelson and BDS, Birthright has become a political battlefield</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago another group walked off the Birthright trip&nbsp;in favor of a tour of Hebron led by anti-occupation army veterans' group Breaking the Silence.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, two Birthright-Israel tours arrived at the City of David National Park in Silwan. At the entrance to the park, eight tour participants announced that they were leaving the group and joined left-wing activists Uri Agnon and Peace Now activist Hagit Ofran for a visit at the Sumreen family home in the neighborhood of Silwan.</p> \n<p>The Sumreen family has been facing eviction notices by the Ir David Foundation and the Jewish National Fund since 1991. Israel declared the family home absentee property and later sold it to the Jewish National Fund, which has been seeking the family's eviction. The family's filed its own suit, but was rejected for failing to prove they had purchased the property. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Birthright regulations, those who leave the tour cannot return to it. The group of eight who walked out intend to continue the trip touring the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They plan to visit Khal al-Ahmar, the Bedouin village slated for demolition, and to join Breaking the Silence for a tour of Hebron.</p> \n<p>Some of the eight people received a message that Birthright intends to cancel their return tickets.</p> \n<p>&quot;We think that part of the story is the occupation and unfortunately Birthright will not show us this reality, they try to leave the occupation out of the story,&quot; said one of the people who left the Birthright tour. Becky Wasserman, 26 from Boston, said that &quot;we tried to point during the tour to the fact that they won't speak to us about the occupation, but we got no answers. They gave us a map of Israel that doesn't have the West Bank borders depicted on it. It's really unfortunate because Birthright is often the only opportunity for young Americans to learn about what's going on.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to Wasserman, she did not plan to leave the tour when she first arrived, but decided to do so once she realized she was not going to receive honest answers about the occupation or hear the perspective of the Palestinians. Therefore, she got in touch with Israeli activists.</p> \n<p>Birthright Israel said: “50,000 young Jews from all over the world have taken part in Birthright so far and it is the leading educational initiative in the Jewish world.”</p> \n<p>“Birthright believes in the ability of the participants to formulate their views and opinions themselves. That is why Birthright will not allow groups with any political agenda to sidetrack the plans for the tours. Participants who interfere with the experience of their friends in the groups for any political objectives will forfeit their deposit and their plane ticket.”</p> \n<p>&quot;More young Jews are joining the protest against Birthright's attempt to cover up the occupation, and instead choose to see what we did as soldiers in the Occupied Territories,&quot; Breaking the Silence said in a statement. &quot;It's time for our right-wing government and Birthright to understand: a prolonged occupation will widen the gap between the Jewish diaspora and Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Peace Now also put out a statement, saying: &quot;We were glad to meet today the young Americans who left the Birthright tour to hear about the situation in Silwan and the story of the Sumreen family, who is in danger of being evacuated for the benefit of settlers.&quot; The group vowed to &quot;continue and present… the complex reality that created by the occupation, especially in Jerusalem.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nasser Halahlih and Isam Elias, the local electronic music duo known as Zenobia, want to revolutionize the global Arabic pop music scene. Their performances are hypnotic. The energy and smiles spread on their faces throughout the entire show are infectious. The wail of their synthesizers, alongside the pulsating beat, creates authentic instrumental music, a full-length tribal trip that many in the world toady are trying to copy without success.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, the instrumental electronic duo from Haifa of Halahlih and Elias have toured Israel from one end to the other. They appeared in bars such as Anna Loulou in Jaffa, Kabareet in Haifa as well as Ramallah in the West Bank, Tel Hai in the far north and many other places.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; An Israeli singer returns to her Yemeni roots – and fans in Yemen approve</p> \n<p>They opened the Roots of Art festival in the south Tel Aviv club Haoman 17 in May. Hundreds danced to their music for over an hour. Just last week, they returned from performing in South Korea, and at the end of the month they will appear in Berlin. They’re also set to perform in the Meteor Festival at Kibbutz Lehavot Habashan in the north in September.</p> \n<p>Elias, 27, was born in Nazareth. He began studying piano in first grade and at 23 he fell in love with the synthesizer. He went on to study at the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music and was part of Ghazall, one of the most important Palestinian-Israeli pop groups today.</p> \n<p>Halahlih, 37, was also born in Nazareth. Originally his family was from a village near Kibbutz Ayelet Hashahar. From there they moved to the Arab city of Shfaram in the north, where his father — who studied film and acting in Tel Aviv in the 1960s — established the first theater.</p> \n<p>In 1996, Halahlih moved to Haifa. He DJed at weddings at night while attending a morning course for DJs. When he realized he wanted to create original electronic music he moved to Tel Aviv, picking up the secrets of the profession gradually from anyone who was willing to teach him. He began to produce clips of trance and psychedelic trance music on a demo version of the legendary Fruity Loops software he had.</p> \n<p>“The first real track I released was ‘Fairuz.’ I sold it for 500 euros to some collection on a German label curated by a guy from Binyamina. Everyone who heard it was in shock at first. It was 2001 and since then things began to roll. Performances, sets,” said Halahlih. In a local Tel Aviv paper from those days Halahlih was described as the first Arab trance artist in the world. At the same time, he began experimenting with electronic pop in Arabic, something that didn’t exist at the time. One of his first projects was “Sha’ababika” (in loose translation: the new kids). in which he wanted to create an Arabic version of the Pet Shop Boys with a friend.</p> \n<p>He began performing in Israel and abroad during that period and released tracks with well-known trance record companies, such as the Danish label Iboga and the German Blue Tunes. His first full studio album was “Checkpoint,” released in 2008 by the Berlin label Iono. The cover featured an image of the West Bank separation barrier.</p> \n<p>Halahlih got a job with a mobile content company and abandoned the studio for a long time. In 2012, musicians from the Jazar Crew, a Haifa-based party collective, approached him and asked him to play his 2008 album live.</p> \n<p>“I went to the Natanzon club in Haifa at 2 A.M. and saw some 200 Arabs dancing dubstep. It was a shock. Suddenly I was sick of my office job and only wanted to make music. I began searching for a direction,” he says.</p> \n<p>The first station on his way back into the music scene was a project called “Fauda.” Halahlih played keyboards, someone else the electric oud and with Ayed Fadel of the Jazar Crew and one of the best-known figures in the alternative Palestinian nightlife culture in Haifa, and in general. The project was quite dark and the lyrics Fadel wrote dealt with slavery and liberation. The trio appeared quite often, even outside Israel. The entrance to the Kabareet club in Haifa still has graffiti with the band’s name on the wall.</p> \n<p>“Kabareet was home for me,” says Halahlih. “I think that I was the first to play there when the place had three tables. I would host all sorts of artists and perform live with them. Ayed always would come up and improvise on the microphone.” And then, on the place’s first birthday, the connection with Elias happened.</p> \n<p>The two already knew each other when they ran into each other at the Ashams radio station and even worked together making children’s’ songs, but nothing much came of it until they met by chance in the club — and this led to the start of Zenobia.</p> \n<p>“I had just left Kabareet, he was just coming in. He told me he was doing an hour-long jam and offered for me to join him. By chance, the keyboard and synthesizers were in my car. We did a very down tempo deep house session. The next day we sat in a caf&eacute; on Masada Street and people told us that we had to do something with it, so we did. In the third rehearsal we decided to lower the beat even a little more. It was Mizrahi with soul, a session of a few hours in which we didn’t stop playing.” That’s where Zenobia was born, says Halahlih.</p> \n<p>Septimia Zenobia was the queen of Palmyra (Tadmor), an ancient city located in what is Syria today. From 267 to 274 she ruled the eastern part of the Roman Empire, which included large parts of Asia Minor and Egypt. That is why they chose the name Zenobia for their project.</p> \n<p>“This is the new Levant, it is our new music and this music connects us to our roots,” says Halahlih. “My father, grandfather and grandmother were Bedouin and they have energy of place and wandering. Our music comes from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Palestine.”</p> \n<p>Despite the deep-rooted characteristics, this is not debka music, the party sounds with darbuka drums, and also not ballads with violins. Zenobia leaves the stigmas at home.</p> \n<p>“We play both our souls, and that of the music we grew up on: We don’t play debka but we toy with ‘maqam,’ the Arabic word for the scale that has quarter tones,” adds Halahlih. “That is the music of the region where Zenobia ruled, on top of which we add a 2018 production.”</p> \n<p>If we are talking about debka, it is hard not to mention the resemblance, at least outward, to the Syrian singer Omar Souleyman. Halahlih and Elias perform in kaffiyehs, headbands and dark glasses, a look modeled, none too subtly, on Souleyman, the king of Syrian wedding music who is credited with reviving the genre.</p> \n<p>“Omar Souleyman is a gimmick as far as I’m concerned,” says Halahlih. “He has been making the same music for years and is not developing in any direction. We live in a world in which people want a show and not just music, and also to film and upload to the internet. We reached the conclusion that because the music that we make is a mix between folklore and the new world we need to express it in clothing too. So we wear a kaffiyeh and headband but wear black clothes and not galabiyas.”</p> \n<p>The revolution the duo is talking about, a mix of old and new, is taking shape day by day. If the first step in the Arab music revolution was Egyptian singer and composer Sayed Darwish, without whom there would have been no Umm Kulthum; and the second was the Jordanian-Palestinian electronic music group 47Soul, as the duo says, will Zenobia be the third step in the Arab pop revolution? Only time will tell, but for now it seems they are heading in the right direction — and all this without releasing a single album.</p> \n<p>Brian Eno came up to them after their performance in the Music Expo festival in Ramallah, the French duo Acid Arab have become their friends after a few visits to Haifa and they are signed with an international booking firm. Soon they will sign with a Belgian-French record company.</p> \n<p>Halahlih: “Our dream is to come out with this music from Haifa to the world, so they hear it in China, they can hear it in Brazil like any other music without all the stories, without all the issues. Until now, Arab music in the new era since Umm Kulthum has not been on the map in the world and this is our dream, they should ask us where it comes from. They should know that it doesn’t come from Europe but from here.”</p> \n<p>If everything goes according to the plan, knock on wood, and you conquer the world, will you continue to work from here?</p> \n<p>Elias: “We’re from here, aren’t we? That’s what makes us special, that is the story our music tells.</p> \n<p>Their music is hypnotic, powerful and seasoned with critical dashes of Levantine acid, and if you ask them about the occupation — they prefer to focus on conquering the global world of music.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Once upon a time, before 1999, there were no Birthright trips. </p> \n<p>Back in the Stone Age, Jewish college students who hadn’t made it to Israel yet and wanted to travel there had to make it happen themselves. That was no mean feat at a time when parents were already shelling out thousands in university tuition. Many opted to spend a semester studying at an Israeli university, so the costs were offset by the fact that no college tuition was being paid in the United States.</p> \n<p>Such programs for “overseas students” included Birthright-style field trips – heavily subsidized by the Israeli government – to the Western Wall, Masada and even West Bank settlements, to learn how they were working toward achieving the dream of the Greater Land of Israel. Some participants drank the one-sided Kool-Aid; others questioned and ridiculed the assumptions of old-school tour guides, whose agenda seemed to be to convince participants to drop everything, join the Israel Defense Forces and immigrate to Israel.</p> \n<p>Weekends and vacations were used by some students to travel on their own, straying from the official route, exploring the country and its complexities for themselves: From such experiences, many a left-wing American Jewish activist was born. None, however, would have considered marching off of the programs’ trips in protest: After all, the outings were something the students and their families worked and paid for, and had consciously chosen to take part in.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Why more U.S. Jews will walk off Birthright this summer | Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Between Adelson and BDS, Birthright has become a political battlefield</p> \n<p>Then along came Birthright – branded as Taglit (“discovery,” in Hebrew) – the free 10-day trips offered to young Jews from North America (lower numbers come from other countries), born out of the worry that not enough of them were willing to make such trips on their own dime. True to its name, Birthright programs have become so readily available that travelling to Israel is no longer viewed as an expensive privilege: It is taken for granted, and – for some – even as an obligation.</p> \n<p>Thus began&nbsp;a decades-long battle over the content of the trips, climaxing in this&nbsp;summer’s two&nbsp;Facebook-dominating, headline-grabbing&nbsp;walkouts&nbsp;staged by the collective IfNotNow, whose stated goal is to end what it sees as the American Jewish community’s support of the occupation.</p> \n<p>While the gambit, along with other high-impact tactics, has successfully boosted the organization's profile – the relatively small group scored a lengthy profile in New York Magazine, it is also rubbing many people – including those sympathetic to their politics – the wrong way.</p> \n<p>The two walkouts that took place,&nbsp;on Sunday&nbsp;and in late June – both carefully coordinated, Facebook-lived, and publicized across all social media platforms – involved young people reading from a prepared text, decrying the fact that the full story of Israel and Palestine is not provided within the 10-day Birthright “heritage trip” itinerary. Once their declarations were made, they headed off to Hebron or East Jerusalem to hear Palestinian voices. Recorded all the way, their confessions were emotional as they navigated the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, telling viewers what a painful and difficult decision it was to break away from the fellow Birthright participants they had grown so close to. Then they arrived at their destinations to rendezvous with Israeli activists from pro-coexistence and anti-occupation groups, who would then show them – and their Facebook audiences – the injustices against Palestinians that Birthright had left off the itinerary.</p> \n<p>The goal may be noble: the method – not so much.</p> \n<p>Birthright’s programs are, essentially a gift, a joint gift from the government of Israel and from wealthy American Jewish individuals and organizations that are certainly self-interested: It is presumably valuable and important that the younger generation travel to and build a connection to the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>But the trips are still a gift. You can dislike or even hate the person who gives you a gift; you can even criticize the size, shape or nature of it. But accepting and enjoying that gift, only to proceed to hurl it publicly in dumpster while loudly denouncing it, is not an attractive sight. Doing so while tearfully declaring what a “sacrifice” one is making, and praising oneself and others for being “brave” – adds absurdity to what already looks like the act of an entitled brat.</p> \n<p>Many Jews are on the same page as some, if not all, of the young idealistic IfNotNow walk-outers and share their criticisms of Birthright. Yes: In an ideal world, organizers of Birthright programs would work harder to educate first-time visitors to Israel about the Palestinian narrative and would not shy away from confronting the occupation. Attempts by the group to lobby Birthright and other Jewish organizations are legitimate, as are its efforts to hand out materials to participants before their departure to Israel in order to raise their awareness and encourage a critical attitude toward what they will experience there.</p> \n<p>But even for sympathizers, the disruptive vignettes recorded and posted live on Facebook – then widely distributed – are destined to get old very fast. The shock factor has already disappeared: the second of the two videos, recorded Sunday, provided none of the conflict and drama of the first. The tour guide graciously deferred to the participants and presented no anger or opposition to them: It looked as if he had been trained for this eventuality, even offering to have a discussion of the Palestinian issue later in the day.</p> \n<p>The biggest protest IfNotNow members on the trip could conjure up was a rebellious refusal to stick around for 10 minutes and sign release forms (allowing them to leave the Birthright program, and acknowledging the fact that their return tickets would be cancelled and that they might have to pay for their trip themselves) before they headed off to East Jerusalem, which made the guide look eminently reasonable and made them look bad.</p> \n<p>So does the skewed claim that they were forced to walk off their trip because otherwise they might never learn about the Palestinian side of the story. The Birthright participants who are students – the vast majority – have a long summer vacation stretching out in front of them, during which they could easily tour Hebron, meet with an East Jerusalem family facing eviction, take part in protests or volunteer for an organization that works against the occupation that they too oppose.</p> \n<p>Indeed, organizers of the program encourages extending stays: There have even been add-on post-Birthright trips created for this purpose by advocacy groups, such as the “Extend” program in which participants meet and interact with groups like Breaking the Silence, B’Tselem and Rabbis for Human Rights. Similarly, a right-wing Birthrighter who wants to know more about the settlement enterprise or the building of the Third Temple in Jerusalem and can’t do so in the framework of the trip can do so afterward.</p> \n<p>The contention that the entirety of a Birthrighter’s education is somehow limited to what he or she hears in those 10 days infantilizes and insults the intelligence of the participants.</p> \n<p>And, of course, for those who oppose Birthright in spirit and in content, there is another option: decide not to accept the gift in the first place, as the hard-left, anti-Zionist Jewish Voice For Peace proposes with its #ReturnThe Birthright campaign.</p> \n<p>The JVP solicits young Jews to pledge not to go on Birthright at all “because it is fundamentally unjust that we are given a free trip to Israel, while Palestinian refugees are barred from returning to their homes.” The organization is saying that if you don’t want the Israeli government or U.S. Jewish establishment donors who don’t share your values to pay for your trip to Israel – stay home, or pay for it yourself.</p> \n<p>Don’t get me wrong: Like most Israelis, I strongly prefer that all young Jews (all young people, frankly) come see the place for themselves. I would far prefer that young leftist Jews go on Birthright with an open but critical attitude and stay on to broaden their perspective rather than remain home and protest Israeli policies from a place of ignorance. But JVP’s message of “stay away” is a more honest, mature and ideologically consistent approach than the mid-trip walkout theatrics of IfNotNow.</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff&nbsp;here</p> \n<p>DRIVING THE DAY --&nbsp;President Donald Trump is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the&nbsp;at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland. Trump and Putin are&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to discuss efforts on&nbsp;scaling back Iran’s presence&nbsp;in Syria. Addressing Israeli&nbsp;concerns&nbsp;about the U.S. leaving the Middle East, National Security Advisor John Bolton&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;yesterday that U.S. troops would remain in Syria as long as Iran continues to “menace” the region. &nbsp;Live Updates [NYT;&nbsp;CNN]  Senator&nbsp;Ben Sasse (R-NE)&nbsp;tweets:&nbsp;&quot;Things Every American Should Know Before the Trump-Putin Helsinki meeting: 1. Exactly who is Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader our president is about to meet with in Helsinki? And what does he want? It’s a complicated question. But here’s what we do know&nbsp;&nbsp;Putin is a crook and a liar. He has broken almost every agreement he has signed with the United States, including on Syria and Ukraine... President Trump should have only one message for Putin: Quit messing with America.&quot;  VIEW FROM JERUSALEM --&nbsp;With Trump strategy unclear, U.S. allies turn to Moscow to secure their interests in Syria -- by&nbsp;Karen DeYoung&nbsp;and&nbsp;Joby Warrick:&nbsp;&quot;Confused by apparently conflicting administration messages, and doubtful that the United States has a plan for achieving its own long-term goals in Syria, regional allies have reached out to Russia... “It’s very clear that Russia and Israel are cooperating on Syria. The Saudis and Russia are cooperating,” said a senior international diplomat closely involved in the conflict... and described those contacts as a “good thing” to the extent that they “helped cool things down.” “The Americans,” the diplomat said, now consider “Syria . . . a Russian thing.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- Netanyahu at the start of the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem:&nbsp;&quot;Yesterday I spoke with US President Donald Trump. We discussed security and diplomatic issues in light of developments in the region, with Syria and Iran first and foremost, of course... I thanked President Trump for his strong policy against Iran because since this policy has been taken, we have seen a great effect on – and inside – Iran. President Trump clearly reiterated his commitment to the security of Israel and his willingness to help the State of Israel in various fields and, of course, I thanked him for that.&quot;&nbsp;  --&nbsp;Israeli officials said Netanyahu called Trump to coordinate before the Helsinki summit.&nbsp;[Axios]&nbsp;  Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel&nbsp;Daniel Shapiro emails us...&nbsp;&quot;Given President Trump's desire for &quot;a good relationship&quot; with Vladimir Putin, his dismissiveness of NATO, his desire to get US troops out of Syria as soon as possible, and his compromised position on Russia's interference in the 2016 election, there is virtually no chance he can successfully pressure Putin to change Russia's behavior on any of these issues. The bigger danger is that Putin will have him for lunch. The absolute best outcome we can hope for is that the summit is a nothingburger, with a few photos and handshakes, but no new decisions or commitments. We should be so lucky.&quot;  ON THE GROUND --&nbsp;Israel Broadens Fight Against Iran -- by&nbsp;Sune Engel Rasmussen and Felicia Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;Israel is ramping up attacks against Iranian supply lines in Syria to block the flow of weapons to Hezbollah and other Tehran-backed militias... In June Israel targeted a far-flung compound near the Syria-Iraq border, according to a security official, after carrying out multiple strikes closer to home against suspected Iranian military assets in Syria... A U.S. official confirmed that Israel was behind it...&nbsp;Israel considers it paramount to roll back Iran’s territorial expansion before the U.S. draws down its forces. Israel’s June strike so far to the east indicated that urgency.&quot;&nbsp;[WSJ]&nbsp;  Syrian state media: Israeli rockets strike military position near Aleppo -- by Lisa Barrington:&nbsp;&quot;Syrian state media said on Sunday that Israeli rockets had hit a Syrian military position near Nairab airport on the outskirts of the city of Aleppo... It said the strikes were an attempt by Israel to support rebels in southern Syria, where Syrian government forces have been waging an offensive.&quot;&nbsp;[Reuters]  FIRST LOOK --&nbsp;Adapted from former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicers's upcoming&nbsp;book&nbsp;titled&nbsp;&quot;The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President&quot;&nbsp;-- on &quot;Holocaust centers&quot; remark:&nbsp;&quot;Earlier, I had been part of a small, impromptu briefing in the dining room off the Oval Office where Secretary [of Defense James] Mattis had explained to the president the degree of the current atrocities committed by Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad. He noted that not even Adolf Hilter had dared to use chemical weapons on the battlefield... When I went into the briefing room to begin the daily briefing, echoes of Mattis's words were still with me...&quot;  &quot;Eleven of the first fifteen questions focused on Syria... I was doing well, talking about the president's reaction and concern. But then came the sixteenth question [about Assad]... I thought to myself, 'I got this.' I had been in a groove expressing the president's concerns and Assad's horrific actions. But instead of staying on the messages that had been working just fine. I tried to turn it up a notch...&quot;  &quot;I read the body language of not only the reporters but also my own staffers along the side of the room. I was beginning to realize I had misspoken badly... Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Natalie Strom, and Raj Shah gave me a look and said, 'Deeper than the Titanic.' Then I noticed a calendar on my computer. It read, 'First day of Passover.' Reince [Priebus] came into my office. 'Remember the first thing you taught me in media training?' he asked. 'Yes,' I said sheepishly. Never compare anyone to Hitler. I made a mistake, a big one, and I needed to say so. I went to the Oval Office to see the president. 'Mr. President, I need you to know that I just stepped in it really badly, and I screwed up.'&nbsp;  &quot;In May [when Trump visited Israel]... I was greatly moved by our brief visit to Yad Vashem... Coming out of Yad Vashem, the Israeli press yelled at me, 'Hey, Mr. Spicer, What did you think? What did you think?' Hope Hicks, who was between me and the president, whispered, 'Just keep going.' 'I think I need to talk to them,' I whispered back. I walked over to the press and spoke about what a profound impact Yad Vashem had on me... And then I just kept walking, in silence for the rest of the way to our vehicle.&quot;&nbsp;  DEEP DIVE --&nbsp;How Israel, in Dark of Night, Torched Its Way to Iran’s Nuclear Secrets -- by&nbsp;David Sanger&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ronen Bergman:&nbsp;&quot;The morning shift of Iranian guards would arrive around 7 a.m., a year of surveillance of the warehouse by the Israeli spy agency had revealed, and the agents were under orders to leave before 5 a.m. to have enough time to escape...&nbsp;The agents arrived that night, Jan. 31, with torches that burned at least 3,600 degrees, hot enough... to cut through the 32 Iranian-made safes. But they left many untouched, going first for the ones containing the black binders, which contained the most critical designs. When time was up, they fled for the border.&quot;  &quot;Fewer than two dozen agents took part in the break-in. Fearing that some of them would be caught, the Israelis removed the materials on several different routes. At exactly 7 a.m., as the Mossad expected, a guard arrived and discovered that the doors and safes were broken. He sounded the alarm, and the Iranian authorities soon began a nationwide campaign to locate the burglars — an effort that, according to an Israeli official, included “tens of thousands of Iranian security and police personnel.” The effort yielded nothing.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  --&nbsp;“This archive explains why we have doubts,” a senior Israeli official told U.S. journalists at the briefing in Tel Aviv...&nbsp;“It explains why the [nuclear deal] to us is worse than nothing, because it leaves key parts of the nuclear program unaddressed,” the official said. “It doesn’t block Iran’s path to the bomb. It paves Iran’s path to the bomb.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  --&nbsp;&quot;Alireza Miryousefi, a minister-counselor at Iran’s U.N. mission, said in response to the new allegations: “Iran has always been clear that creating indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction is against what we stand for as a country and the notion that Iran would abandon any kind of sensitive information in some random warehouse in Tehran is laughably absurd. It’s almost as if they are trying to see what outlandish claims they can get a Western audience to believe.”&nbsp;[WSJ]  REPORT --&nbsp;Moscow hosted indirect Iran-Israel talks, claims Kuwaiti newspaper:&nbsp;&quot;A Kuwaiti newspaper claimed on Friday that indirect talks have taken place in Moscow between Iran and Israel in an attempt to find solutions for a number of regional issues...&nbsp;Al-Jarida&nbsp;said that the visits to Moscow of senior Iranian official Ali Akbar Velayati and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the same time were not a coincidence. They were, it claimed, arranged by the Russians to conduct indirect talks.&quot;&nbsp;[MiddleEastMonitor]  Truce Called After Israel Strikes Gaza Over Rockets, Arson -- by Felicia Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;Israel and Gaza settled into an uneasy truce Sunday after their most intense fighting&nbsp;since the 2014 war&nbsp;over the weekend... Israel’s military struck dozens of Hamas targets in Gaza during an air campaign on Saturday that Mr. Netanyahu said was “the hardest blow” dealt to Hamas since Israel’s ground war four years ago, which was in response to an escalation of mortar and rocket fire from Gaza.&quot;&nbsp;[WSJ]&nbsp;  ‘Give peace a chance,’ UN envoy tells Palestinians -- by&nbsp;Khaled Abu Toameh:&nbsp;&quot;UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Nickolay Mladenov appealed to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Sunday to halt rocket and mortar attacks on Israel... during a news conference in Gaza City... “I appeal to the Palestinian factions to not provoke incidents at the fence, to stop firing rockets and mortars, to stop the incendiary kites and to give peace a chance,” Mladenov said.&quot;&nbsp;[JPost]  Israel has Iran on the brain, and all the kites in Gaza won’t change that -- by&nbsp;Avi Issacharoff:&nbsp;&quot;Israel sees getting dragged into a complicated war in Gaza over incendiary kites as unnecessary for the IDF while a much more critical campaign is being waged in Syria over Iran.&quot;&nbsp;[ToI]  REPORT --&nbsp;Price tag for Trump’s $250,000 Jerusalem embassy is in – at $21.5 million -- by&nbsp;Bryant Harris:&nbsp;&quot;Documents uploaded&nbsp;this week to the official database of federal spending show that Maryland-based joint venture Desbuild Limak D&amp;K has been awarded a $21.2 million award to design and build “addition and compound security upgrades” to the embassy in Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood. That’s in addition to the&nbsp;$335,000 spent&nbsp;to get the facility... ready for its ritzy grand opening as an embassy back in May.&quot;[Al-Monitor]  2018 WATCH --&nbsp;In rebuke of Dianne Feinstein, Kevin de Le&oacute;n wins endorsement of California Democrats in Senate race -- by Phil Willon:&nbsp;&quot;California Democratic Party leaders took a step to the left Saturday night, endorsing liberal state lawmaker Kevin de Le&oacute;n for Senate in a stinging rebuke of Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein... The endorsement was an embarrassment for Feinstein, who is running for a fifth full term, and indicates that Democratic activists in California have soured on her reputation for pragmatism and deference to bipartisanship.&quot;&nbsp;[LATimes]  4,500 Tech Workers, 1 Mission: Get Democrats Elected -- by Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel:&nbsp;&quot;In a year and a half of existence,&nbsp;Jessica Alter's Tech for Campaigns has become a kind of Democratic Geek Squad — a national volunteer network consisting of more than 4,500 tech workers with day jobs at companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix and Airbnb. These volunteers, who include engineers, marketers and data scientists, are matched with Democratic campaigns across the country to provide training on digital skills, such as how to promote themselves on social media, build their email lists and use data analytics to identify potential donors.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  HEARD THE OTHER DAY -- Democratic congressional candidate (NY14) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez explained her criticism of Israel in an interview on PBS' Front Line:&nbsp;&quot;I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist. I am a proponent of the two state solution... But I also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue...&nbsp;I just look at things through a human rights lens, and I may not use the right words – I know this is a very intense issue... Middle Eastern politics is not exactly at my kitchen table every night, but I also recognize that this is an intensely-important issue for people in my district, for Americans across the country. And I think at least what is important to communicate is that I am willing to listen&nbsp;and that I’m willing to learn and evolve on this issue as I think many Americans are.&quot;&nbsp;[Video]  David Remnick:&nbsp;&quot;Come November, Ocasio-Cortez is almost certain to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Will her democratic-socialist identity push the Party to the left?&nbsp;[NewYorker]  Bernie Sanders Calls Out Disney CEO Bob Iger:&nbsp;&quot;Bob Iger is overpaid, according to Bernie Sanders.&nbsp;The longtime senator from Vermont took the Disney chief exec to task on Friday, asking in a tweet why Iger is paid hundreds of millions of dollars, while workers at Disney theme parks struggle to make ends meet.&quot;&nbsp;[TheWrap]  2020 WATCH --&nbsp;$88 Million and Counting: Trump Amasses Huge Head Start for 2020 Campaign -- by&nbsp;Ken Vogel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rachel Shorey:&nbsp;&quot;President Trump has raised more than $88 million for his re-election campaign over the last year and a half... The committee received $169,500 from the real estate developer Stanley Chera. Mr. Chera partnered with the company owned by the family of Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, on a&nbsp;$1 billion deal&nbsp;to sell the retail space at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan... Separately, America First Action, a “super PAC” dedicated to supporting Mr. Trump and allied candidates,&nbsp;filed a report&nbsp;on Sunday night revealing that it had raised more than $5 million between mid-May and the end of June. Major contributions came from the Los Angeles real estate developer Geoffrey Palmer, who donated $2 million, and the casino executive Cherna Moskowitz, who donated $1 million.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]&nbsp;  THE DAILY KUSHNER --&nbsp;How Jared Kushner Helped Bring the 2026 World Cup to North America -- by Emily Jane Fox:&nbsp;&quot;Last July, around the time when the White House was starting to dig into helping with the FIFA bid, Kushner took a surreptitious trip to Saudi Arabia where he spent considerable time with Crown Prince&nbsp;Mohammad bin Salman.&nbsp;(The two reportedly&nbsp;stayed up until 4 A.M.&nbsp;in the morning in private conversations.) This person said that Kushner asked M.B.S. directly for Saudi Arabia’s vote. He did the same with the House of Khalifa in Bahrain. “He was asking for a very large thing—to vote for the U.S. instead of a more natural partner, in Morocco,” this person said. “And yet, they were very willing.” ... Kushner leaned on the relationships he’d developed in his NAFTA talks with both Mexico and Canada to make sure the other two countries were on track in putting their bid packages together.&nbsp;[VanityFair]</p> \n<p>** Good Monday Morning!

He has defended his approach by saying that the writer’s obligation is to the “emotional truth” and that it’s “presumptuous to assume that from today’s perspective one can truly understand the horrors of the concentration camps.” This seems disingenuous. Whether or not it’s possible to understand another person’s horrific experience, writers and readers of fiction operate under the assumption that such an understanding is worth trying to achieve.&quot;  &quot;Holocaust novels—for adults as well as for young readers—tend to include extensive afterwords detailing the stories on which they are based and the ways, if any, in which they deviate from their sources. Such research alone isn’t sufficient to make a novel effective, but at least it assures the reader that the novel has a basis in reality. Worryingly, Boyne’s book is now often included in Holocaust-studies curricula at schools, and many teachers say that young readers who first learn about the Holocaust by reading it form a drastically ahistorical impression of what took place.&quot;&nbsp;[NewYorker]  HOLLYWOOD -- Benjamin Millepied heading to Tel Aviv this fall&nbsp;-- by Amy Spiro:&nbsp;&quot;Natalie Portman may have&nbsp;very publicly turned down a trip to Israel earlier this year.

But privately, they consider him a global wild card and bristle at his efforts to build walls, figuratively and literally, against immigration and free trade. “Will political and corporate leaders at Davos seek to flatter Trump to get on his good side or give him the cold shoulder given their growing concerns about his leadership?” asked David J. Kramer, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;  “Who Will Donald Trump Appease In Davos: His Base Or The Global Elite?” by Tarini Parti and Ben Smith:&nbsp;&quot;If I were talking to Donald Trump — and who knows, maybe he's watching TV somewhere — I would say: Come to Davos to build alliances,&quot; said Jane Harman, a former Democratic member of Congress from California and now-president of the Woodrow Wilson Center... &quot;It's the right thing to do and it's the best strategy in a world that's increasingly tribal,&quot; she said, describing DC to this global audience as &quot;the entertainment capital of the world.&quot; [BuzzFeed]&nbsp;  SPOTTED at Davos -- Alexander Soros, the son of George Soros, with Jordan's King Abdullah II:&nbsp;&quot;Always an honor to meet with his majesty,&nbsp;#kingabdullah&nbsp;of&nbsp;#Jordan, who continues to do so much to quell tensions worldwide in these troubling times!&quot; [Pic]  DIPLOMACY -- President Trump will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday&nbsp;”to reiterate America's strong commitment to Israel and efforts to reduce Iran's influence in the Middle East, and ways to achieve lasting peace,” National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said yesterday at the White House press briefing.  REPORT: &quot;Kerry to Abbas confidante: 'Stay strong and do not give in to Trump'&quot; by&nbsp;Ben Caspit:&nbsp;&quot;Former US Secretary of State John Kerry met in London with a close associate of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, Hussein Agha... During the conversation... Kerry asked Agha to convey a message to Abbas and ask him to &quot;hold on and be strong.&quot; Tell him, he told Agha, &quot;that he should stay strong in his spirit and play for time, that he will not break and will not yield to President Trump's demands.&quot; According to Kerry, Trump will not remain in office for a long time...&nbsp;Kerry... recommended that Abbas present his own peace plan... He promised to use all his contacts and all his abilities to get support for such a plan.&quot;  &quot;He surprised his interlocutor by saying he was seriously considering running for president in 2020. When asked about his advanced age, he said he was not much older than Trump and would not have an age problem.&quot;&nbsp;[JPost]  A senior White House official told reporters during&nbsp;a background briefing that&nbsp;the last time Jason Greenblatt or Jared Kushner had spoken with&nbsp;Palestinian leadership was prior to Trump’s Dec. 6th&nbsp;announcement on Jerusalem: &quot;One of the tragic things that I have noticed since&nbsp;Dec. 6th&nbsp;is there are so many Palestinians who are reaching out... over the past 12 months, both in the West Bank and Gaza and Palestinian Americans. They all want to continue to talk, but they're all afraid to talk. So they're asking... for quiet meetings, private meetings. They're under a lot of pressure not to talk. It doesn't bode well for what we're trying to create if there's no freedom of speech among the Palestinians, so that troubles me greatly. And we're trying to figure out how to deal with it.&quot;  LORD, CHIEF RABBI AND... SPEECHWRITER:&nbsp;“Britain’s former chief rabbi behind Pence’s biblical Knesset address” by Raoul Wootliff: &quot;Rabbi [Jonathan] Sacks was an instrumental part of crafting the vice president’s speech,” a source with knowledge of the speech writing process said. “Rabbi Sacks provided input and editorial suggestions on various drafts throughout the writing process.” A White House official said that Pence met with Sacks for some 90 minutes in New York in November “explicitly to discuss themes and structure for the speech” and that the rabbi was consulted throughout the entire speech drafting process. Sacks’ office confirmed the meeting and Sacks’ influence on the speech, telling The Times of Israel that he met with Pence “at the request of the vice president” and that the two had ‘a very good meeting.”” [ToI]&nbsp;  Rabbi Meir Soloveichik writes &quot;As I walked out of the Knesset following Vice President Mike Pence’s Monday afternoon address, an Israeli cameraman turned to me with a jovial expression. Speaking in Hebrew, he asked me about the man whose speech he had just heard: “Was that the messiah, or the vice president of the United States?” The cameraman was also probably struck by how religious, and biblically based, the speech was. Mr. Pence threaded his remarks with references to Scripture, a rhetorical technique Knesset audiences have rarely heard from a political leader since Menachem Begin resigned as prime minister in 1983. Mr. Pence’s address was one of the most Zionist speeches ever given by a non-Jew in the Knesset.” [WSJ]&nbsp;  “What Mike Pence Just Did in Jerusalem” by Aaron David Miller:&nbsp;”Mike Pence’s trip was less important for what it accomplished than what it reflected and represented: Under Trump: the U.S.-Israel relationship has undergone a transition from a valued special relationship to one that’s seemingly exclusive Pro-Israeli vice presidents have come and gone to Israel (Al Gore, Joe Biden) but none seems to have left the impression Pence did What’s new is that you now have an influential vice president sitting next to a president who shows no interest even in pretending to be even-handed on the Arab-Israeli conflict; he’s all in for Israel.” [Politico]&nbsp;  “Pence, the Anti-Trump, Takes Israel by Storm” by Zev Chafets:&nbsp;“Despite dire predictions by some American experts, the Arab countries that matter aren’t even pretending to be outraged by the Trump administration's tilt to Israel. The Palestinian Authority, having boycotted an American vice president, has had a chance to measure the efficacy of that approach. Mahmoud Abbas came home understanding that salvation is not going to come from Brussels. For the team currently putting together Trump’s &quot;ultimate&quot; Middle East deal, these are insights worth having.” [BloombergView]&nbsp;  &quot;Pence Visit Was a Balm to Israelis. Now Back to Reality&quot; by Isabel Kershner:&nbsp;&quot;“After Pence leaves and Bibi takes off for Davos, the Arabs will still be here,” Ben Caspit, a political columnist,&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;on Tuesday in the Maariv newspaper.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Shalom Lipner writes “Forget the Ultimate Deal. The Mideast Needs the Status Quo:&nbsp;Governments in Ramallah and Jerusalem are blaming each other for the impasse and climbing into the trees, where they will wait petulantly for some incentive to justify their return to dialogue Israel will appeal to the administration for greater latitude to create facts on the ground, while the Palestinians will cry betrayal and circle their wagons. In such an environment, the order of the day is containment — making sure that violence does not erupt and preserving the hope of constructive interaction once the atmosphere clears.&quot; [ForeignPolicy]&nbsp;  IRAN DEAL -- &quot;Nixing the Iran Deal Would Be Better Than a Fake Fix&quot; by Richard Goldberg:&nbsp;&quot;A phony fix might only address long-range missiles that don’t even exist yet, legitimizing Iran’s perfection of short, medium, and intermediate range ballistic missiles capable of wiping out U.S. bases, allies, and interests. A fake fix, like the one&nbsp;under&nbsp;discussion&nbsp;in the Senate, might also detach Iran’s missile activity from the automatic resumption of sanctions, instead outlining lesser sanctions that will never successfully deter the mullahs from pressing forward with their illicit missile program.&quot; [ForeignPolicy]&nbsp;  STATE-SIDE: Florida&nbsp;Legislators push proposals to punish companies boycotting Israel --&nbsp;by James Call:&nbsp;“House Speaker Richard Corcoran Tuesday threw the weight of his office behind an effort by Rep. Randy Fine, R-Brevard, to toughen Florida’s prohibition of doing business with companies that boycott Israel. Fine wants to eliminate the $1 million threshold that triggers the ban so that any contract with any company boycotting Israel would be prohibited Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Miami is sponsoring a resolution to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital Fine’s HB 545 and Moskowitz’s 1027 will be debated in committee Wednesday.

The Salt Fish team decided to take advantage of the opportunity to let the three journalists unknowingly lead a group of assassins straight to Arafat. An argument broke out among the Salt Fish team members: Was it right to endanger, and probably kill, the Israeli citizens? The answer, they decided, was that it was. But Arafat suspected that Mossad might be keeping tabs on Avnery. His security guards took strict deceptive countermeasures, and the Salt Fish team lost their trail in the alleys of south Beirut.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  &quot;Poisoned Toothpaste and Exploding Phones: Israel’s Proxy for War&quot; by Ethan Bronner: &quot;Ronen Bergman, the intelligence correspondent for Yediot Aharonot newspaper, persuaded many agents of Mossad, Shin Bet and the military to tell their stories, some using their real names...

        "text":["<p>Buses carrying thousands of Christian pilgrims descended upon Qasr el-Yahud on the first Sunday in January. They had arrived at that spot – the banks of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized, according to religious tradition – from near and far, from Italy and Ramle, Nazareth and France, Bethlehem and the Galilee, but mainly from the nearby city of Jericho.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; Sweet Jesus! How Israel is missing out on a huge tourist opportunity with Christians</p> \n<p>The thousands of Catholics and Protestant pilgrims got off the buses near the monastery of St. John the Baptist, and from there walked about a kilometer (approximately half a mile) in a long procession led by hundreds of brown-robed priests. Many of them sang. At the head of the procession were Father Francesco Patton, the Franciscan leader who holds the title of Custos – the Roman Catholic Church’s chief custodian of the Holy Land – and Lt. Col. Azhar Ghanem, head of the Israel Defense Forces Liaison Office in Jericho and the Jordan Valley. Dozens of female soldiers in flak jackets secured the area.</p> \n<p>The history of Qasr el-Yahud is amazing, but the site itself is extremely problematic. The main question is why the whole area, encompassing no fewer than seven ancient and fascinating monasteries, chapels and churches on the western banks of the river, and located over the Green Line, is still mined and booby-trapped, often preventing thousands from visiting there each year. Visitors to the site, which reopened seven years ago after it had been closed for more than 40 years, can only take one route: leading from the Greek Orthodox St. John the Baptist Monastery to the Jordan. They are not allowed to deviate: Both sides of the road and the area in general are marked as containing minefields.</p> \n<p>The proximity to Israel’s border with Jordan, the fear of infiltrators and a lack of understanding of the importance of the site to pilgrims led to extensive mining of the area after the 1967 Six-Day War. The current estimate is that there are 4,000 mines in the vicinity; most are anti-tank, a minority are anti-personnel mines. All of them were laid by the IDF and have become obsolete in the past 50 years. In addition there are rumors that some of the monasteries themselves have been booby-trapped in sophisticated ways in order to prevent entry into them. In 1968 Qasr el-Yahud was closed and entry was totally prohibited. Only in 2011 was the baptism site on the riverbank opened in its current form: as an enclave within a closed military zone, under the management of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.</p> \n<p>The most popular celebration at the site will take place on Thursday, January 18, when the Greek Orthodox, Romanian and Ethiopian churches will mark the end of the holiday season that began on Christmas. In the Eastern churches the holiday celebrates the baptism of Jesus; in the Western churches it marks the Feast of the Epiphany, commemorating the visit to Jesus by the Magi – the three wise men or kings who, according to Christian tradition, arrived in Bethlehem from the East to bow down before the newborn “king of the Jews.”</p> \n<p>As per tradition, believers immerse themselves in the river on this holiday at the precise location where John the Baptist immersed Jesus, as described in the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. After the crucifixion of Jesus, his baptism became one of the most significant events in the history of Christianity and this site is thus of great importance. Some have even attributed curative powers to the water there.</p> \n<p>The Jews’ castle</p> \n<p>The name of the baptismal site, Qasr el-Yahud, reflects the perception, according to Jewish tradition, that this is also the place where the Children of Israel crossed the Jordan during their Exodus from Egypt. The literal translation is “Castle of the Jews” but many claim that the words have been scrambled and actually mean the “fracture” or “break” of the Jews — the place where the river split open to enable safe passage. Arabs, incidentally, don’t call the site Qasr el-Yahud, but rather Al-Maghtas: the place of immersion. Jewish belief also holds that the site is where Elijah the Prophet ascended to heaven in a “chariot of fire” and where the prophet Elisha performed miracles.</p> \n<p>Catholics, especially the Palestinians among them, do not customarily dip themselves in the river but rather pray there and fill plastic bottles with the water. The hundreds of people who did enter the chilly Jordan on January 7 were Greek or Eastern Orthodox, many of them tourists from Russia, arriving on the same day the Roman Catholic Franciscans marked the Epiphany. The masses of other pilgrims around them did not decrease the tremendous excitement of the Greek or Eastern Orthodox visitors one bit: Clad in white robes they had purchased for NIS 27 (about $8) at a local gift shop, they strode ceremoniously into the brownish water, praying and in many cases immersing themselves in it completely.</p> \n<p>The relative security quiet in this area and the general flourishing of Israel’s tourism industry both contributed to the record-breaking number of visitors to Qasr el-Yahud last year: 590,000. Moreover, the fact that there is no entry charge, in contrast to the competing site on the other bank in Jordan where tourists pay 12 dinars (about $17) for the visit – also helps in attracting many pilgrims. According to Lt. Col. Ghanem, Qasr el-Yahud is considered the third most important site in the region for Christian believers, after the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem. The IDF and the Civil Administration talk about the possibility of considerable investments in the vicinity, including connections to the regional electricity and water grids, but they know very well that the major obstacle to the development of Qasr el-Yahud – the land mines in the vicinity – has yet to be addressed properly.</p> \n<p>Early history</p> \n<p>The seven monasteries and other structures in the vicinity of Qasr el-Yahud cover 1,000 dunams (approximately 250 acres), stretching over about a kilometer and a half (just under one mile), between Highway 90 and the river. The first monastery one reaches, at the junction of the road that descends to the baptism site itself, is the Monastery of St. John the Baptist. The structure was built on the foundations of the original Byzantine church at the site and it is the largest and most important of the Jordan River monasteries. The ancient structure was destroyed in an earthquake in 1024. In the 12th century it was rebuilt by the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komemnos.</p> \n<p>Other buildings of note are located to the south of the monastery. The octagonal structure directly to the left is a Franciscan chapel that was built in 1958. To the south, on the right side of the road, is a Syrian Orthodox monastery, which was mostly destroyed in an earthquake, and also a Coptic monastery consisting of two buildings erected in the 1940s. Further to the south, on the left-hand side, is the hexagonal-shaped Russian chapel and next to it, the smaller Chapel of the Bells. Some 200 meters (about 220 yards) along the way stands the Ethiopian Monastery of the Holy Trinity, flanked by a Romanian monastery with the green dome that was built in 1934.</p> \n<p>Across the way on the eastern bank of the Jordan, in the place identified as the biblical Beth Bara (Judges 7:24) stands a Greek Orthodox church with a gilded roof. Next to it is Tel Elijah, thought to be the exact place where Elijah ascended to heaven.</p> \n<p>In May 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the messiah was about to come to Qasr el-Yahud – or in other words, that an agreement had been reached to clear the mines near the site. The agreement was ostensibly reached at the time between the churches, the Israeli Ministry of Defense – which is responsible for what is called the Israeli National Mine Action Authority – and the Palestinian Authority. Yet nothing at all has happened on the ground since then. Not a single mine has been cleared from the area. Although the number of land mines is very large, the area of Qasr el-Yahud itself is about one square kilometer (about 250 acres).</p> \n<p>In rely to a recent query from Haaretz, Defense Ministry officials said optimistically that in the coming year all the mines will be cleared from the Qasr el-Yahud area. The work will be carried out by the Mine Action Authority and thereafter, according to supremely confident sources at the ministry, there will be safe access to all the monasteries in the vicinity. Hallelujah.</p> \n<p>Judging by the past 50 years, however this optimistic Defense Ministry declaration will face a tough reality check in the coming year, at a junction where the Palestinian Authority, the different branches of Christianity and the State of Israel meet. Lt. Col. Ghanem clarified in the Haaretz interview that Israel’s intention, ultimately, is to reopen all the chapels and monasteries to those seeking to worship there; each of the denominations in question will be responsible for their respective structures. In addition the status of the greater Qasr-el Yahud are will not change: It will continue to be an enclave, subject to the restrictions of a closed military zone, and administered by the army, the Civil Administration and the parks authority.</p> \n<p>Urban vs. Christian tourism</p> \n<p>Prof. Noga Collins-Kreiner of the University of Haifa believes that the underlying problem at these sites is Tourism Ministry policy. She says the state is not investing enough in Christian tourism and prefers urban- or seaside-oriented tourism. Moreover, she says, the state is in general not investing enough in outlying areas and Qasr el-Yahud is certainly a peripheral area – a Christian site in a somewhat remote, desert location, right on Israel’s border and abutting PA land in Jericho.</p> \n<p>“The government,” says Collins-Kreiner, “helps the strong – Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.” The data she has collected shows a continuing decline in religious Christian tourism to Israel. In the past, about a third of the tourists visiting the country were Christian pilgrims. Currently they account for only about 20 percent.</p> \n<p>Paul, a Palestinian from Jericho, sits beside me on the wooden stairs going down to the Jordan River. He says that he is happy it is a holiday, that the sun is shining after several days of rain and that his two small children are able to experience Epiphany with him. He does not want to talk about politics because, he adds, it will destroy his mood. Eventually, however, he changes his mind and says: “It’s a fact that we got here today. Got here without any problems. They let us cross. The situation now is a little better than it used to be. The procession with the priests stopped in Jericho before it continued to here and there we also received blessings from the PA people. It’s too bad they didn’t come here with us but I understand them. Look, there isn’t a single Palestinian flag here on the columns. Only Israeli flags and church banners. This is not respect.”</p> \n<p>The two of us are silent for a moment. Then I ask: “Is it strange for you that Israeli army officers in uniform are greeting the procession and the heads of the church on a Christian religious holiday?”</p> \n<p>Paul stares at me as though he has seen an alien from outer space, and smiles. Then he wishes me a happy holiday and goes off to make sure his children don’t jump into the water.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ex-Justice Minister Dan Meridor responds to Avigdor Feldman's article about the Shin Bet and torture:</p> \n<p>I would like to say that, even though I never made this public, in my role as minister of justice (1988-1992), I waged an intensive campaign in regard to the Shin Bet security services modes of interrogation. To the best of my knowledge, no other justice minister, before or after me, did likewise.</p> \n<p>I thought that it was my duty toward the law, morality and character of Israel to ensure that even for a noble cause – thwarting terrorism and protecting human life – there are boundaries that must not be crossed. I believed, and I still believe, in the indispensability of the directive that [then-Prime Minister] Menachem Begin gave to the head of the Shin Bet, Avraham Ahituv, in their first meeting, on June 29, 1977: no physical pressure (or: force) is to be used in Shin Bet interrogations, only the interrogators intelligence.</p> \n<p>Even though the Shin Bet answers to the prime minister and not to the minister of justice, I decided that I was responsible for seeing to it that the judicial system, which I headed, would be involved, at its initiative, in the matter of Shin Bet interrogations, and would ensure the laws enforcement here, too. I used to say at the time that the states values are not determined in university lectures, but in the interrogation rooms. That is why I dealt with the subject in an ongoing manner.</p> \n<p>I held many and frequent meetings with the head of the Shin Bet and with the agencys senior staff on this subject. Taking part with me in the meetings were senior officials of the Justice Ministry, including the state prosecutor, Dorit Beinisch, the assistant attorney general, Yehudit Karp, and others. We did not flee our responsibility: to back up the Shin Bet personnel in the lifesaving work they do, but at the same time to make sure they did not breach the law and did not resort to violence, certainly not torture.</p> \n<p>It should be noted that I began my service as justice minister about a year after the Landau Commission report, which found that there were indeed unacceptable, infuriating modes of interrogation being employed, and also that the truth had been concealed from the judicial system. At my initiative, I gave talks to courses of Shin Bet interrogators and explained to them the prohibitions and their underlying rationale. I emphasized that this was not double talk. I remember suggesting to them the following test: Imagine that someone is filming you as you interrogate a suspect. Would you agree to show the film to your children at home? If not, dont do it. One cadet said to me: If we do what you say, there are liable to be more terrorist attacks. I replied: Im not sure of that, but even if you are right, when youre asked why you didnt use harsher methods in the interrogation, refer the questioners to me. I bear responsibility.</p> \n<p>I didnt make do with holding meetings with the heads of the service and with the interrogations unit (headed by the late Haim Ben Ami) and with giving talks in courses of interrogators. I asked to visit the interrogation rooms and meet with detainees. The head of the service at the time, Jacob Perry, accompanied me on one such visit to the Shin Bet facility outside Ramallah, where I met with interrogators, perused the interrogation files and also commented on an entry [in the log] that left me with concerns that a prohibited method of interrogation had been used. During the visit I also spoke with detainees who had been interrogated in the facility.</p> \n<p>The Landau report was submitted in late 1987. Attorney General Yosef Harish adopted it and confirmed to the interrogators that those who acted solely according to what the report permitted would not be indicted. From time to time, complaints were raised about the use of force and even of torture. Every complaint that reached me from private individuals or from organizations that deal with human rights, such as the Red Cross, Amnesty, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, BTselem and others, was immediately sent on for inquiry.</p> \n<p>On at least one occasion I raised a suspicion (which came to my knowledge from reading a report published in Haaretz by Ari Shavit) in a meeting of the ministerial security committee that violence had been used against detainees in an interrogations facility in Gaza. The state prosecution, headed by Dorit Beinisch, dealt with this unceasingly.</p> \n<p>In December 1989, the head of the service, Jacob Perry, reported that one of those being held in the Gaza facility – Khaled Sheikh Ali – had died during an interrogation. The state prosecution demanded that the person who had done it be found. The head of the service submitted the names of two interrogators. They were tried, convicted in district court of criminal negligence causing death and sentenced to six months in prison. Their lawyer informed me that he would ask for a pardon. I told him: Dont bother – I will oppose it. They will serve a prison term. Let it be clear that we mean what we say and these deeds will cease.</p> \n<p>Since the convicted individuals were not spared prison, they asked to tell what really took place and related that they were not the only ones who acted this way. We held a meeting about this grave development, and in coordination with the state prosecution, Perry appointed a committee of inquiry headed by the assistant state prosecutor, Rachel Sukkar, to investigate the issue. The two other members were senior Shin Bet officials. The committee submitted a very grave report, which indicated – from the testimonies of Shin Bet personnel themselves – that two years after the Landau report, serious acts like these were still taking place in the Gaza facility and being concealed.</p> \n<p>I took the report – the Sukkar report – to [former Supreme Court President] Moshe Landau at his home on Alharizi Street in Jerusalem. He read it in my presence, and his response was: I feel betrayed. When the Shin Bet personnel appeared before the commission, I believed them when they said that these things would cease completely. He himself met, at his request, with Prime Minister Shamir in order to apprise him of the gravity of the matter, in his view, and demanded that sharp measures be adopted.</p> \n<p>I remember well a meeting that I convened in my bureau in the wake of the Sukkar report, with the participation of Attorney General Harish, State Prosecutor Beinisch, the assistant attorney general, Karp, and others, with the heads of the Shin Bet. We said harsh things there. Afterward, significant measures were taken in the Shin Bet.</p> \n<p>It is, of course, not within the authority of the justice minister to decide who will stand trial, and I did not intervene in any specific case. Still, I remember well the considerable involvement of the state prosecution in such matters, and the activity it undertook with regard to putting people on criminal and disciplinary trial. To validate further the prohibition on torture of any kind, I brought for the governments ratification the UNs 1985 Convention Against Torture, which was indeed ratified by Israels government in 1991.</p> \n<p>I could go on and on, but I will not do so here. The occupation with enforcing the law against those who held power in their hands was a central issue that I dealt with in the Ministry of Justice. The occupation of the ministry – the minister, the senior personnel and, mainly, the state prosecution – with enforcing the law in Shin Bet interrogations was, in my perception, our public duty. Coping with methods of interrogation against terrorism is difficult. Democracies – including the United States with its constitutional regime and Supreme Court – have failed in this (see, for example, the United States in Guantanamo and Britain in Northern Ireland). I am convinced that in my term as minister of justice we did our duty and brought about a significant improvement in this moral and judicial issue. At the same time, there is no doubt that we did not succeed in eradicating the phenomenon completely. The High Court of Justice ruling on torture did that 10 years later.</p> \n<p>Dan Meridor is an attorney and politician whose long career includes tenures as cabinet secretary; member of Knesset; chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee; justice, treasury and intelligence minister; and deputy prime minister.</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here!</p> \n<p>RISING STAR PROFILE:&nbsp;The Magic Skin of Glossiers Emily Weiss: How fast can a beauty blogger become the millennials Este Lauder?&nbsp;About three years by Amy Larocca:&nbsp;Emily Weiss has been something of a millennial icon, the star of her own fairy tale, ever since 2007, when she showed up on three episodes of MTVs The Hills... Weiss herself is obviously Glossiers secret sauce—its gloriously friendly, photogenic, hardworking face, the Este of this baby Lauder. But maintaining both that image and distance from it is a complicated dance—there are thousands of pictures of Weiss out there in the world, so many Q and As, and it takes a while to figure out how carefully drawn and maintained her boundaries are...&nbsp;That two-step is not unusual for Weiss— gestures of intimacy deployed alongside strategic walls. She gets right in there on the comment boards, replying to her customers one-on-one, but you never get the sense that Weiss is vulnerable...&quot;  This isnt a traditional, top-down, lifestyle, myth-creation, inspiration story, she says. This isnt a Tory Burch, a Ralph Lauren, an Estee Lauder. A lot of our customers dont even know who I am. Weiss sees herself not as a visionary but as someone who realized something was happening—social media was transforming the way beauty products were talked about and bought— and then worked her ass off to get on top of it. If people want to be like her, well, it is the era of the aspiring she-E-O. Me being CEO is probably aspirational to a lot of customers, she admits. There were very different value systems when a lot of different beauty brands were created in the 40s and 50s, and it had to do with glamour and a life of luxury.

Ginsburg, who turns 85 in March, would have to stay another decade to near the record of William O. Douglas, who served the longest at 36 years...&nbsp;If Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the presidency in 2016, liberal Ginsburg would likely have announced her retirement by this spring.

Royce... was&nbsp;among the House lawmakers considered vulnerable&nbsp;in the upcoming midterm elections...&quot; [LATimes]&nbsp;  Sander Gerber, the hedge fund manager behind the Taylor Force Act,&nbsp;tells us...&nbsp;Ed Royce is the most humble champion of Israel in the House. After he saw the Palestinian Authoritys pay to slay laws, he did whatever he could to build support for their eradication. From personally walking me over to discuss the issue with Senator [Bob] Corker to holding hearings in Congress and ultimately passing the Taylor Force Act. And he gladly made himself available at all hours via cell, because he really cares.  Joel Mowbray, who has spent much time on the road with&nbsp;Chairman&nbsp;Royce,&nbsp;shared his favorite story: &quot;I was with him when he confronted Mahmoud Abbas in the Palestinian Authority presidential palace in Ramallah during&nbsp;an&nbsp;AIEF [America-Israel Educational Foundation]&nbsp;trip. There were four Jewish Democrats with him, he was the sole Republican on the&nbsp;trip... After the cameras left the room, Royce, in this toe-to-toe setting,&nbsp;confronted Abbas on his Holocaust denial&nbsp;and said, 'Dr. Abbas,&nbsp;I know we're supposed to call you doctor because you have a PhD in Holocaust denial.&nbsp;Abbas's face goes ashen white, and he said, 'I want to talk to you about an interview you gave recently to an Iranian-owned Hezbollah radio in Lebanon, in which you yet again denied the Holocaust. You know, my father was a Forward Observer in Patton's Third Army,' and Royce pulled out this full-size manila envelope&nbsp;with photos&nbsp;that his father took and starts putting them onto the table that's set up between them and he says, 'These are photos that my father took on the day Dachau was liberated.&nbsp;These photos represent one day at one camp. There were countless other such examples that occurred, and for you to say what you have said and continue to say about the Holocaust is deeply dangerous.'&nbsp;He even, by the way, put one of the photos in Abbas's lap, because he refused to look at them.&nbsp;To me, that sums up everything that Ed Royce is... The mark of Ed Royce is fearlessness, especially in terms of dealing with other people in diplomatic settings.&quot;  ON THE HILL --&nbsp;The House will vote today on H.Res. 676 – supporting the rights of the people of Iran to free expression, condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate protests, and for other purposes&nbsp; -&nbsp;legislation sponsored by Rep.

The Guardian understands Trump is planning not to sign the waiver in regards to the state broadcaster when it comes up for renewal at the end of January, meaning the sanctions will become active It is a symbolic act.

It comes at a time of heightened tension between France and Israel, as President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Philippe refuse to accept Jerusalem as Israels capital city. [Telegraph]&nbsp;  Trumps peace deal: A Gaza-centered Palestine by Ben Caspit:&nbsp;There isnt a single member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet who has any expectations about President Donald Trump's peace initiative. Instead, they share a rare consensus: It's all about nothing, and it will never amount to anything. The same sentiment prevails in Ramallah: Trumps &quot;ultimate deal&quot; is dead and buried...&quot;  &quot;The basic idea includes an extensive territorial exchange, in which Egypt would cede a piece of the Sinai Peninsula to the Gaza Strip. With this, Gaza's territory would extend southward along the seashore, making it three or four times larger than it currently is. This would make it possible to relieve some of the pressure in Gaza According to this plan, the center of power in the future Palestinian state would be in the Gaza Strip, expanded toward the north of Sinai, rather than the West Bank. In exchange the Palestinians would give up territories in the West Bank, allowing Israel to annex the settlement blocs along with a generous amount of land around them... At the same time, Israel would give Egypt a narrow strip of territory along the lengthy southern border between the two countries. [Al-Monitor]&nbsp;  Ilan Goldenberg,&nbsp;a former State Department official under John Kerry, tells us...&nbsp;&quot;The Palestinians are not going to trade high quality land in the middle of the West Bank for a bunch of sand in the Sinai.&quot;&nbsp;  NEW DATE -- After a couple delays, Vice President Mike Pence&nbsp;is expected to visit Egypt, Jordan, and Israel next week.&nbsp;According to the schedule released by the White House yesterday, Pence&nbsp;will arrive in Egypt on January 20 to&nbsp;meet with President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, and the following day,&nbsp;meet with&nbsp;King Abdullah II in Jordan.

NEW PLAYER: 'Walking a line --&nbsp;The shrewd tactics of the White Houses evangelical gatekeeper by Michelle Boorstein and Sarah Pulliam Bailey:&nbsp;As Israel has shot to the top of President Trumps agenda, world leaders have looked for the perspective of one of Trumps biggest and most reliable voting blocs. And Johnnie Moore, the White Houses evangelical gatekeeper, has been there to provide it.

And I now have had the privilege of working with him on some of the most complex diplomatic challenges imaginable. The President I have seen is a man of incredible insight and intelligence. But he is not a politician and that confuses his critics. When President Trump refuses to speak in stale political platitudes, his critics think he is missing something. But the truth is President Trump speaks to the country in an authentic and genuine way that Americans understand and appreciate.&quot;&nbsp;  David Brooks writes...&nbsp;&quot;The Decline of Anti-Trumpism:&nbsp;People who go into the White House to have a meeting with President Trump usually leave pleasantly surprised. They find that Trump is not the raving madman they expected from his tweetstorms or the media coverage... People who work in the Trump administration... think he is merely a distraction they can work around.

        "text":["<p>The discovery and destruction this month of the Hamas tunnel from the Gaza Strip into Israel, the largest and most complex engineering project of the tunnel venture, reinforced the sense that a solution has been found to what was until recently described as the main strategic threat to Israel from the Strip.</p> \n<p>The fact that this demolition was preceded by three similar operations, Hamas’ measured response to the systematic destruction of its most important weapon and the promises that the tunnel threat will disappear within a year only heightened the feeling that we are on the right path. The statement to Arab media outlets by the coordinator of government activities in the territories that “Israeli genius and the Jewish brain have found a solution to the terror tunnels” gave Israelis the good feeling that we are indeed “all that.”</p> \n<p>The combination of military achievements in Gaza with the routine damage to Iranian and Hezbollah military assets in Syria, also to little real response, makes us feel our security situation has never been better. Add to this the most supportive U.S. administration in Israeli history, the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ words of desperation and frustration, and there’s cause for celebration. In September 2016 Haaretz then-analyst Ari Shavit wrote that our security situation was never better, and since then it’s only improved.</p> \n<p>But this optimistic feeling ignores an important element. Hezbollah’s enormous rocket stores pose an unprecedented threat to Israel. Defense officials judge that in the first days of the next confrontation with Hezbollah, 3,000 to 4,000 rockets will be fired into Israel, some of them highly precise and with high payloads.</p> \n<p>If the threat is realized, there be hundreds or thousands of casualties and significant damage to infrastructure: airports, seaports, power stations, desalination plants, transportation hubs and the like. Hezbollah’s missiles are capable of hitting not only has enough rockets to hit not only the Kirya military center in Tel Aviv but also the upscale neighborhoods around it. The military response to the threat is only partial, and it cannot prevent most of the damage.</p> \n<p>In other words, our security situation has never been worse. In 1948, when Egyptian planes bombed Tel Aviv, killing dozens, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion believed the public would stand it. It’s hard to imagine today’s spoiled, hedonist Tel Avivians withstanding a much heavier assault. In 1948 we knew why we were fighting; today the issues are much less clear. It could spark Israel’s worst crisis ever, surpassing even the one following the Yom Kippur War.</p> \n<p>This situation is not divinely ordained. The secret of Zionism’s success for most of its history was its ability to solve challenges that seemed intractable. The problem is that today’s Israel is focusing on solving a challenge that has no military solution. Not even additional missile interception methods can prevent massive destruction deep inside Israeli territory.</p> \n<p>Similarly technological solutions to the tunnel threat do not solve the challenge posed by the presence of two million Gazans who are driven to further despair with each demolished tunnel. Every additional bombing in Syria or destruction of a tunnel in Gaza increases the pressure to retaliate on the other side, to a point where it might explode. Without Hezbollah’s ballistic capabilities such an explosion may not have been so terrible, but given their presence the consequences could be unimaginably difficult.</p> \n<p>The solution to the growing dangers has long been on our doorstep, but our leaders will not even consider it. On December 13 the president of Iran, the state behind the ballistic threat to Israel, signed a document stating “we support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of 4 June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Ash-Sharif as its capital. We support peace based on a two-state solution. The borders of Jerusalem will be determined in negotiations. ... we support, as a strategic choice, the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, which was adopted in 2005 by an extraordinary Islamic summit conference.”</p> \n<p>President Hassan Rohani signed this document at a session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul. Apart from one analysis by Akiva Eldar on the Al-Monitor website, there was no reference in the Israeli media to this change in Iran’s position. Iran had never before expressed support for the Arab Peace Initiative. This pivot is a game-changer, and also a reflection of slogans heard in the recent wave of demonstrations in Iran, calling on the state’s leaders to spend less on Hezbollah, Syria and the Gaza Strip and more on domestic needs.</p> \n<p>Again, in the absence of the stick wielded by Hezbollah it wouldn’t be so terrible for Israel to ignore the new Iranian carrot, but the existence of this stick makes ignoring the Arab Peace Initiative irresponsible.</p> \n<p>On the eve of the Yom Kippur War we believed our situation had never been so good. This is what we believe now. We know how it ended then. This time it may end up much worse.</p> \n<p>Uri Bar-Joseph is a professor in the international relations department of the University of Haifa.</p>",

They came here as a last resort, as refugees,” the letter stated. “They gave birth to children here who were born in Israel and aren’t familiar with any other place; they work – when they’re allowed to; they dream about a better life. And now the Israeli government and Knesset members want to deport these people, who bear the burden of emotional and physical pain. They all want to live here and to live in dignity. Their number is very small, less than half of one percent of the Israeli population, and they don’t create any real problems.</p> \n<p>“Israel has no financial difficulty in absorbing them and giving them a life of honor. There’s no problem with turning them from invisible people with no identity into residents with a name and an identity – and, along with the identity, responsibility and a contribution to Israeli society.”</p> \n<p>The letter adds that an unbearable situation has been created in south Tel Aviv – both for the asylum seekers living in subhuman conditions and the original residents, who suffer the consequences of the situation due to the government’s refusal to grant asylum to the refugees and letting them the earn an income.</p> \n<p>“We, directors, writers, producers, actors, women and men, representatives of the film and television industry in Israel, demand that the deportations be prevented, and expect you to act with proper morality and compassion, and give these people a permanent sanctuary in our country,” the letter said. “Remember that you were a stranger in the land of Egypt.”</p> \n<p>Eran Riklis, who has taken a 7-year-old Eritrean girl who lacks residency status under his wing, told Haaretz: “The deportation of the asylum seekers justifies civil disobedience. This country can’t be allowed to deport people who lack the ability to defend themselves.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>An estimated 2,000 people demonstrated in Ashdod for the second consecutive Saturday evening against the southern city’s plan to prohibit businesses from opening on Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Protesters who gathered outside city hall carried signs proclaiming “The city is putting my home up for sale,” “No to religious coercion” and “Each to his own faith.” They also called on Mayor Yehiel Lasri to resign.</p> \n<p>Demonstrators were protesting the city’s issuing of closure orders to businesses in Ashdod shopping malls that open on Shabbat. Municipal officials say the orders were given following complaints and in light of the so-called supermarkets law passed by the Knesset some two weeks ago. The new law gives the interior minister the authority to repeal any future municipal bylaws allowing stores to open on Shabbat.</p> \n<p>Speakers at the demonstrations repeatedly said they have nothing against the city’s ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) community and that their message is meant for the mayor, who has not responded publicly to the protests.</p> \n<p>Political figures who came to show their support for the protesters included Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid and MK Ilan Gilon (Meretz).</p> \n<p>“Ashdod’s fight isn’t local, it’s a battle over the character of the state, over freedom of choice, over the question of whether Shabbat divides us or unites us,” Lapid said.</p> \n<p>Local protesters included Ilia and Alexandra Veltman, who were there with their 1-year-old son. “During the week we don’t get a chance to go out,” Ilia said, adding that “in the rest of the country no one intends to enforce the law – in Ashdod they do.</p> \n<p>“It’s not a city with an ultra-Orthodox majority. It’s not Tiberias or Beit Shemesh, and what scares me is that we’ll turn into Tiberias from the demographic perspective, with a Haredi majority,” he added.</p> \n<p>Earlier Saturday, Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman visited the city’s Big Fashion mall – one of three shopping centers in Ashdod that are open on Shabbat, until recently without any interference from the municipality.</p> \n<p>Addressing the crowd, Lieberman said that anyone who calls the supermarkets law meaningless “is wrong and is deceiving others. Unfortunately, the supermarkets law has wide-ranging repercussions,” he said. “Its passage was seen in a few city municipalities as an order to attack. Everything we are seeing here in Ashdod, unfortunately, is the direct result of the supermarkets law.”</p> \n<p>Responding to the defense minister's visit to the mall, Interior Minister Arye Dery said he's &quot;had it with Avigdor Lieberman.&quot; The so-called supermarkets law was promoted intensely by Dery, who praised its passage earlier in January as &quot;the preservation of the status quo and the victory of the silent majority.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>One of my clearest childhood memories may sound amusing today, but its all true. In the 1970s, I lived in the Yekke (German-Jewish) Moshav Sde Warburg in the Sharon, in central Israel. Yusuf, the wagon driver from the neighboring village of Tira, would drive through the moshav once a week with his wares, ringing his bell. He sold fruits, vegetables and various herbs produced in the village. Housewives would go to his wagon, choose what they wanted and run home to do the cooking. Since then, Tira has turned into a city, and with its modernization and change in status, lifestyles changed too, and the wagon driver disappeared.</p> \n<p>As far as I'm concerned, all my life I've lived next to the Arab village that became a city. But when my children began to go to school, I developed a kind of emotional connection that was translated into a desire to research the place, which interested me somewhat more than nearby Kfar Sava. That's how it happened that for a villager like me, the closest town, with all its urban and culinary services, is Tira. I have an interest and a desire to see it flourish, and in that spirit, I'll recommend some of the best and most accessible places to satisfy the palate.</p> \n<p>Tira is active all week long, but if you're interested in fresh, outstanding merchandise, the best days are Thursday and Friday. On Shabbat Tira is very crowded, and features a market with no real connection to the place.</p> \n<p>Where to shop</p> \n<p>Meat and poultry. Tira is full of butcher shops, some of them good and some less so. I recommend going to the cleanest and best known, one that has quite a number of customers, meaning a high turnover of merchandise. I've been going for years to Yusuf Iraqi's butcher shop, located at the southern entrance to the city, next to the vegetable store. Yusuf has 30 years experience, and despite his stern look, offers good professional service. The most highly recommended meats are the outstanding lamb and the poultry, which is much freer of feathers than in any supermarket.</p> \n<p>Hummus. For many tourists, Tira is where you go for hummus, and one place thats worth a stop is Hummus Hajaj. The owner, Mahmoud Hajaj, worked for many years as a citrus grower in the Sharon. Then, 16 years ago, he opened a competing hummus shop next to the famous Hummus Lul, which serves an equally good product. Hummus in most places in Tira is relatively uniform, with a creamy texture and a delicate taste, but Hajaj offers a pleasant extra: a thin, hot pancake made with flour and onions. Sinful, simple and wonderful.</p> \n<p>Fish and seafood. Despite the fact that it's relatively distant from the sea, Tira has fishmongers that are just as good as those in Acre and Jaffa, the best of which is Hadi's Fish from Jaffa. Hadi (whose original name is Walid) is a native of Jaffa who married a local girl. Due to the high cost of real estate in Jaffa, he moved to Tira, his wife's home town. Hadi has a small, immaculate fish store with excellent fresh merchandise.</p> \n<p>During the week most of the fish comes from marine agriculture, but on the weekend (Thursday to Saturday), there is really nice merchandise from the sea. Another good reason to come here: A year and a half ago, Hadi opened a restaurant that serves fish prepared in the simplest way (there are also complex dishes, but I recommend skipping them). The fish are simply wonderful, the salads somewhat less so. You will find the place on Al Salam Street: Take a left at the first square after entering town, and drive 400 meters. The restaurant is on the left.</p> \n<p>Baked goods</p> \n<p>You can't spend time in Tira without some kind of baked goods. At the Abu Hassan Bakery near the big square (in the direction of Kokhav Yair, or ask any resident for directions) they have all the familiar Abulafia-style baked goods, but on weekends they sell fatayer, a pastry filled with spinach and goat cheese, a real Shabbat treat.</p> \n<p>Finally, a good place for farm produce in Tira is the Zohara grocery, located in the center of the village. The fruits and vegetables are very fresh, and in the summer theres mulukhiyah (the leaves of corchorus olitorius), without the branches – a serious upgrade. There is also wild spinach, grape leaves and more. On weekends theres pita with zaatar (hyssop) which is tastier than any you've sampled, and kubbe filled generously with meat and pine nuts, seasoned to perfection, which creates a carnival of flavors and textures when dipped in tahini. The grocery is located on the main street between the post office and city hall.</p> \n<p>And if youre already in Tira, here are a few more quick recommendations:</p> \n<p>Shwarma Samara: Good, juicy shwarma with fresh salads that are replenished frequently. The falafel, on the other hand, should be skipped. At the big square behind city hall</p> \n<p>Daas butcher shop: Another recommended place for purchasing meat in Tira is located at the eastern exit from the city. The butcher shop has a slaughterhouse with all the required permits and also offers kosher merchandise. Recommended for variety meats. Telephone 077-2730890</p> \n<p>Nazareth Sweets: Without any real connection to Nazareth, but with excellent baklava that is rich in nuts, as well as knafeh (a traditional Middle Eastern cheese pastry) thats not at all bad (and has no food coloring). The place is air conditioned, with tables, and is a good place to enjoy an espresso with warm knafeh.</p> \n<p>Kliyat Amjad (Amjad Roasting): Shortly before you get to Hadi's fish, on the right youll find a spice shop called Kliyat Amjad. The name itself makes it clear that this is a store with not only spices but also nuts and seeds, legumes and coffee that is ground on site. This is a huge store with a large selection. So whats worth buying? The spices, legumes and coffee are highly recommended. Western brand candy bars should be checked for sell-by dates.</p> \n<p>Fureidis Fish: Owned by a family from the village at the entrance to the Carmel, from which the place takes its name. There is good merchandise, but its not clear just when the store is open.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A tsunami of allegations hit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in mid-February, with the police recommending that he be indicted for corruption. The premier has faced such crises before, but never on such an unprecedented scale.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Four major police investigations are threatening to dethrone &quot;King Bibi.&quot; Two have already seen the police recommend indictments against him, and two more are gathering momentum at a frightening rate for the prime minister.</p> \n<p>Here's what you need to know...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case involving gifts and favor-trading</p> \n<p>After more than a year of investigations, interrogations and endless speculation, on February 13 the Israel Police informed Netanyahu&nbsp;they are recommending that he be indicted&nbsp;for bribery, fraud and breach of trust in two cases.</p> \n<p>Now it’s up to the head of Israel’s legal system, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, to decide whether the evidence is strong enough to indict the prime minister, following the police recommendations made public on Tuesday night.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What is Netanyahu accused of?</p> \n<p>The first of the two criminal probes – which the police call Case 1000 – involves straightforward bribery and favor-trading. In fact, the affair is commonly referred to by the items Netanyahu and his wife Sara allegedly took as bribes –&nbsp;cigars and champagne.</p> \n<p>The Netanyahus haven't disputed that they got lavish gifts from two wealthy friends: Israeli-born Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan; and Australian billionaire James Packer. But they vehemently deny the presents were in exchange for political favors such as promoting the two moguls’ business interests,&nbsp;or for obtaining visas.</p> \n<p>The expensive cigars and pink champagne Milchan regularly sent to the Netanyahus were merely tokens of friendship, the prime minister and his team have argued; likewise an expensive piece of jewelry requested by Sara Netanyahu as a birthday gift.</p> \n<p>Packer’s generosity was also directed toward the Netanyahus’ eldest son, Yair – free airplane flights and five-star hotel rooms – not to mention tickets for all of the Netanyahus&nbsp;to a concert by Packer’s ex-fianc&eacute;e, Mariah Carey.</p> \n<p>According to the police report, however, Milchan was rewarded for his generosity. The evidence released regarding a quid pro quo arrangement provided the basis for a recommendation to indict Hollywood producer Milchan on bribery charges along with the prime minister.</p> \n<p>The police report stated that the investigation &quot;revealed that the relationship between the prime minister and Mr. Milchan was one of criminal bribery and not an innocent relationship between friends.&quot;</p> \n<p>The police report detailed five specific areas in which Netanyahu allegedly performed favors for Milchan:</p> \n<p>* He pushed for the so-called Milchan law, which cuts taxes for Israelis returning to Israel after spending time abroad – a break worth over 1 million shekels for Milchan. MK Yair Lapid, Netanyahu's finance minister in his previous government, testified to this, police said.</p> \n<p>* He assisted Milchan in getting a new 10-year U.S. visa.</p> \n<p>* He arranged a meeting between Milchan and the then-director general of the Communications Ministry to advance the producer's interests in the Israeli television market.</p> \n<p>* He helped further a deal tied to Indian businessman Ratan Tata, who was Milchan's business partner. The report said Netanyahu &quot;pushed the deal even though officials in the Defense Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office opposed the project.&quot;</p> \n<p>*&nbsp;He also intervened to prevent the collapse of the television network Channel 10, in which Milchan was a minority shareholder.</p> \n<p>Together, police said, Milchan and Packer's gifts to the Netanyahus are estimated to have amounted to 1 million shekels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The police report was based on testimony from the gift-givers and their employees, as well as receipts and other documents.</p> \n<p>The case involving Israel's leading newspapers and Netanyahu’s relationship with Sheldon Adelson</p> \n<p>The second allegation of wrongdoing is known by the police as Case 2000.</p> \n<p>This centers around Netanyahu’s supposed desire to receive better coverage in one of the country’s leading dailies, Yedioth Ahronoth – a desire strong enough for him to&nbsp;allegedly cut a deal with the paper’s publisher, Arnon Mozes.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was caught on tape telling Mozes he would convince Yedioth’s&nbsp;main competitor – the free daily Israel Hayom, owned by Netanyahu patron Sheldon Adelson – to limit Israel Hayom’s circulation, thus boosting Yedioth. In return,&nbsp;Netanyahu allegedly asked Mozes to ease off on his paper’s highly critical coverage&nbsp;of the prime minister and his government.</p> \n<p>In interviews, Netanyahu has said the offer to Mozes wasn’t serious; rather, he was “testing” him. But Adelson reportedly told the police when questioned last May and June that Netanyahu indeed tried to persuade him to back off from plans to expand Israel Hayom. And former Netanyahu chief of staff Ari Harow, who was involved in the talks between Mozes and Netanyahu – and who allegedly recorded the conversations on the premier’s behalf –&nbsp;turned state’s evidence as part of the deal&nbsp;in a separate fraud case against him.</p> \n<p>Like Milchan in Case 1000, police recommended that Netanyahu's alleged partner in crime be indicted as well.</p> \n<p>The case involving favorable coverage on an Israeli news site</p> \n<p>A week after Netanyahu was hit by the police report recommending indictment in cases 1000 and 2000, a potentially even bigger bombshell hit him: one confidant turning state's evidence in what the police call Case 4000 and reports that another confidant, Nir Hefetz, allegedly tried to bribe a former judge by offering her the plum post of attorney general in return for her closing several cases involving the premier's wife, Sara Netanyahu, in 2015.</p> \n<p>Case 4000 involves suspicions that Netanyahu, in his role as communications minister from 2014 to 2017 (while he was also prime minister), intervened with regulators to help the Bezeq group, which is controlled by Shaul Elovitch. In exchange, Elovitch, a longtime friend of Netanyahu’s, allegedly ordered Bezeq’s Walla news site to provide favorable coverage of the prime minister and his wife Sara.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Two of Netanyahu's confidants and several senior officials at Bezeq were recently arrested as part of the ongoing corruption investigation.</p> \n<p>On February 20, former Communications Ministry Director General Shlomo Filber became a state's witness in the case&nbsp;– a dramatic development given Filber is suspected of serving as the middleman between Netanyahu and Elovitch.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is expected to be questioned in connection to the case in the future.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case involving German submarines</p> \n<p>Case 3000 involves suspected corruption&nbsp;in Israel’s purchase of submarines and other naval vessels&nbsp;from Germany’s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Several men close to Netanyahu are suspected of bribing Israeli defense officials to get them to buy submarines from the Germans.</p> \n<p>One of the suspects, Michael Ganor,&nbsp;has turned state’s evidence&nbsp;in exchange for a year in prison and a $2.8 million fine. Ganor has reportedly testified that attorney David Shimron promised to use his close ties to Netanyahu – as his cousin and personal lawyer – to advance the submarine deal. Ganor, ThyssenKrupp’s representative in Israel, has also used Shimron as his attorney.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is also expected to be questioned in connection to this case.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How long can Netanyahu really last as PM?</p> \n<p>If his past behavior and statements are any indication, Netanyahu will battle to the bitter end; he’s determined to be prime minister for as long as possible.</p> \n<p>Responding to the initial police recommendations on February 13, Netanyahu vowed to carry on as prime minister. &quot;These recommendations mean nothing in a democratic society,&quot; he said, adding that he will &quot;continue to lead Israel responsibly and faithfully.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A week before the police report was released,&nbsp;Netanyahu released a defiant video statement on Facebook: “Many people are asking me what’s going to happen to me. I want to calm you all down. Nothing will happen, because I know the truth. I am confident at the end of the day that the legal authorities will conclude that the simple truth is that there is nothing to all this.”</p> \n<p>Much like U.S. President&nbsp;Donald Trump, Netanyahu has characterized the criminal investigations against him as a partisan witch hunt. He has repeatedly accused his enemies in politics and the media of trying to oust him using the legal system because they failed using the ballot box. He has vowed not to let that happen.</p> \n<p>But increasingly, Netanyahu is being seen as crippled, weakened by each revelation of a close friend or confidant possibly turning against him. There is growing doubt as to whether he will be able to hold onto political power as he fights the growing list of accusations against him.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How long will the legal process take in Cases 1000 and 2000?</p> \n<p>The procedure for indicting a public figure is far from speedy. First, prosecutors have to consider the evidence the police have provided. Then they have to give it to Netanyahu’s lawyers, after which a hearing is scheduled with the attorney general, where the prime minister’s team can argue why the evidence is insufficient.</p> \n<p>Only then will Mendelblit make his final decision on whether the prime minister will face charges. Potentially, this process could be extremely long. The police investigation took far longer than expected due to Netanyahu’s busy schedule and extensive travel. The same reasons may be used to extend the process of organizing his team’s pre-indictment hearing, thus delaying the filing of any potential indictment.</p> \n<p>What happens next?</p> \n<p>Under Israeli law, Netanyahu isn’t obligated to resign even if he’s actually indicted.</p> \n<p>In 2008, in the midst of various corruption investigations, then-Prime Minister&nbsp;Ehud Olmert&nbsp;announced his plan to step down, saying he couldn’t fight his legal battle properly while running the country. He didn’t even wait for the police recommendation to indict him. In the end, he was convicted of taking bribes and&nbsp;served more than 16 months in prison. But the more-prestigious Netanyahu – now in his fourth term as prime minister – holds a much firmer grip on power than Olmert ever did.</p> \n<p>Plus, Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party and its partners in the governing coalition are likely to stay loyal to him, in order to prevent the collapse of the government and a new general election. On the other hand, a massive anti-Netanyahu protest movement could make his party and coalition lose faith. In polls, the majority of Israelis (nearly 60 percent in a December TV poll, for example) say they believe Netanyahu should resign if the police recommend an indictment.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Talking to: Sunitha Krishnan, social worker, activist, cofounder of the Prajwala organization, visiting Israel as a guest of the Genesis Prize Foundation; lives in Hyderabad, India. When: Thursday, 7 A.M. Where: Hotel lobby, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>What, in practice, are you engaged with?</p> \n<p>Prajwala, which means “eternal flame,” is an organization, apparently the largest in India, that fights trafficking in women. We have saved 20,000 teens and girls in prostitution, and we run the biggest shelter for victims of sex trafficking.</p> \n<p>The scale of human trafficking in India is known to be among the largest in the world. For obvious reasons, it’s difficult to estimate its true scope, but it’s clear that the data supplied by the government hardly reflect the actual situation.</p> \n<p>According to the information in my possession, every 10 minutes a person is sold into the Indian sex industry. Of them, 45 percent are children. Human sex-trafficking is an industry with a turnover of hundreds of billions of dollars a year. It’s important to understand that in underdeveloped areas, the life of a girl isn’t valued much in any case. She is just another mouth to feed. There are all kinds of methods for getting rid of her: She’s strangled in infancy, placed in a bucket of ice so she’ll get pneumonia. For a family like that, the chance to sell their daughter for $8 or $10 is a golden opportunity.</p> \n<p>A girl like that, who could even be 4 or 5 years old, will pass through any number of hands before arriving at the final destination: a brothel. She will be forced to sleep with dozens of men a day. Every day. She will become addicted to alcohol and drugs, because there is no other way to bear such an existence. Do you understand why this is my life mission? It is impossible to do nothing in the face of that cruelty.</p> \n<p>India is developing at a dizzying pace, but together with the economic prosperity and the technological progress, the rate of human trafficking is also increasing.</p> \n<p>The phenomenon is spreading not only in India – it is a worldwide trend. Technology is actually giving the industry a significant push. If in the past it was easy to assess which populations were vulnerable, and to try to implement preventive measures, nowadays, by means of technology, the criminals and exploiters can reach every home and the transactions take place below the radar.</p> \n<p>What do you mean?</p> \n<p>What people tend not to understand about trafficking in women is the fact that it is perpetrated by organized crime at the highest levels and on a vast scale. Behind every woman, adolescent or girl in prostitution lies a long chain of people who brought her to that state. These organizations employ huge numbers of people whose role is to locate more and more girls and women. The modus operandi of purchasing girls and teens from poor families still exists, but alongside that, many additional girls enter the circle, including from the more established classes, because today, under the cover of technology and the social networks, the lines have become blurred. Now, along with the people who are physically looking for girls, there are handlers who connect with girls through the social networks, using false profiles. They pretend to be girls themselves, tempt them into escaping from home and then sell them. They persuade them to have their picture taken in revealing poses and send the photographs to porn sites or use them as a means of extorting the girls, who are afraid of what will happen if their families find out.</p> \n<p>In your articles, you describe a long, orderly chain, which extends from someone within the community, from the girl’s close milieu, whose role is to locate the victim through someone who knows her personally and who brokers the transaction, all the way to the owners of the brothel, the pimp who’s in charge of her, and of course the clients.</p> \n<p>That chain can begin with a salesman in a store where she buys things, or even with a worker in the local temple, who knows, for example, that the family is going hungry or that a particular girl is on bad terms with her parents, or was married off to someone who is now abusing her. It’s someone the girl knows who will finally strike the deal. From there she begins to go from hand to hand and might be sold dozens of times.</p> \n<p>Whenever we rescue a girl, we know exactly who pimped for her, because he goes to court and claims custody of the girl, claiming she is his daughter or sister or niece, that she is not working in prostitution but was arrested by mistake. That’s a huge problem for us, because the frightened girl will cooperate with him. She knows that if she resists she will be killed or her family will be harmed, and so she will never say, “Yes, this is the person who sold me,” but always, “That’s correct, this is my uncle.” It’s impossible to expect anything else from a young girl who is being raped by dozens of men a day, who is viciously beaten by her guard, by the pimp, by the clients.</p> \n<p>You cite figures that are very hard to digest: 93 percent of the women will never succeed in getting out of this. Of the 7 percent who do succeed, the great majority return to prostitution. That’s a very high rate of recidivism.</p> \n<p>Once a girl or teen enters that world, her chance of leaving it is almost nonexistent. They are subjected to intensive brainwashing. Real indoctrination. They are taught to be afraid of the police, of women’s organizations, of people who were previously close to them. They are completely isolated from the world, and they are told that everyone is against them, that if they dare leave they will be thrown into jail for life. They believe this, of course. It’s explained to them that the family and the community will never accept them back – and sadly, that part is true. They know they can’t go home. Again, because the technology is so convenient and available, already on the first day of her arrival she is photographed with a client, and if she only dares to try something the photograph will be used against her; it will be shown to her parents and to the whole village or neighborhood.</p> \n<p>It’s full-fledged slavery.</p> \n<p>It is the slavery of our time. The level of dependence the girls have on their pimps and managers is incomprehensible. To the girl, they are God. She will do whatever they tell her. Like a puppet. Even the few who manage to extricate themselves, they almost always manage to go back.</p> \n<p>If so, how do they perceive you? Who are you, from their perspective?</p> \n<p>I am not the savior for them. On the contrary: I am a person who is exploiting them, who wants to remove them from the supposedly safe place. This is a problem that exists only in human sex-trafficking. Children who are sold or abducted into slavery, who work 15 hours a day in a factory, understand that they are victims. These girls don’t. They don’t understand what is being done to them.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons for the very high rate of recidivism is that in their minds, in their consciousness, they are controlled by their enslavers. They are convinced that it’s their fault, that it’s their choice. Even if we get to them early, the damage has already been done, and things of course get more complicated when they start to earn money.</p> \n<p>In the first months, sometimes in the first years, they work in order to repay an imaginary debt that their employer invents.</p> \n<p>When they arrive they are told: You owe us this or that for the trip. For the room. For the food. They work a long time for nothing, and when they begin to be paid it’s already too late to rescue them. For many of them it’s the first time in their life that they’ve seen money.</p> \n<p>Do the families know what awaits the girl, or do they really believe that she is going to the big city to be married or because a respectable job awaits her?</p> \n<p>They know, but pretend not to know. As I mentioned, in almost every case of trafficking there is someone from the inside, someone from the close or extended family involved. They know.</p> \n<p>I suppose the girls tell themselves that the family doesn’t know – otherwise they wouldn’t be able to survive.</p> \n<p>Of course. But even more than that: She will tell herself that she is doing it for the sake of the family, that she is sacrificing herself to save them. I just had a terrible case of a girl whom we rescued, who was ill with AIDS, and the disease was advancing with dizzying speed. She simply lay dying in our shelter. She begged us to send her home, because she wanted to die at home. I rushed to court and obtained an order allowing me to do that, but when I called her mother she shouted at me that the girl would ruin her siblings’ chances of marrying and she hung up on me. That girl sent money home for four years. Her family had no problem taking the money, but they didn’t want to see her again.</p> \n<p>Words fail me.</p> \n<p>I cried, too. I cried when I spoke to the mother and begged her. I told her: Your daughter wants to die at home. One of the hardest things I’ve done, certainly one of the most painful, was to have that girl’s body cremated.</p> \n<p>By yourself.</p> \n<p>Only I was there.</p> \n<p>How old was she?</p> \n<p>She was 16 and was sold when she was 12. I can’t grasp it.</p> \n<p>I don’t think it’s possible to grasp it. Did you tell her the truth?</p> \n<p>At first I tried to tell her the truth, and then I stopped. She was so proud of what she had done for her family. We saw her fading and fading, but she kept asking: What is happening? Can I make the trip [home] today? In the end I told her gently that her mother was very worried about what people in the village would say when they saw that she was so sick. Even then she tried to understand. She asked if they could come to the shelter to part from her. I called her mother again, and simply begged her. I promised to pay for her ticket and to put her up. She refused.</p> \n<p>Please tell me that this is an exceptional story. It’s too much to take. How can you take it?</p> \n<p>Cruelty is part of my life. I have seen so much already, and still, human cruelty never ceases to surprise me. That story haunts me, I can’t shake it off. You know, she died about three weeks after we rescued her, but at the time we rescued her she was with a client. She was too sick to stand up, but she was still working.</p> \n<p>‘Gang-raped at 15’</p> \n<p>Maybe we can talk a little about your personal story, which actually prompted you to become active.</p> \n<p>I was gang-raped when I was 15. Of course, I don’t want to talk about what happened there. The truth is that I don’t remember much, and that might be because I prefer not to remember, but I can say that what happened afterward made me the person I am today. I remember how I was treated like a criminal, because of a crime I did not commit. I remember that I, the victim, was made to pay the price for what was done to me. I still burn with anger at that, despite all the years that have passed. That’s what drives me. Whenever I see how society turns its back on these girls, how it perceives them to be criminals, I burn with anger. Every time I see another innocent girl enter that world, another helpless child entering that world, my anger only grows.</p> \n<p>In a TED India talk you gave, you showed photographs of 3- and 4-year-old toddlers who were sold into the sex industry. How can that be?</p> \n<p>The youngest child I rescued was 3 years old. I think a lot about the mindset of men everywhere in the world – Western men mainly, who go to the East for paid sex with small children who work in brothels. By the way, from the dealers’ point of view it pays more to sell and buy children, because these clients are willing to spend a great deal for them.</p> \n<p>It’s so sickening.</p> \n<p>This horror exists under the patronage of those who maintain it. People who are ready to pay for sex services from the helpless. What is amazing with the children is that, in contrast to the adults, they are more mentally resilient. Their rehabilitation process is far more rapid and effective. But what we came to understand, the hard way, is that this is temporary. Even if at the age of 5 or 6, the child appears to have recovered and been rehabilitated, within a few years their situation will deteriorate. Apparently the mechanism is that young children don’t fully understand what has happened to them, but when they reach adolescence, they start having flashbacks. They remember all the men who raped them, they understand what it actually was, and then they sink, they break, they become suicidal, they are very violent. A great many of them will go back to the street. So that with children, it’s far more difficult, in the end.</p> \n<p>I remember a story of a 7-year-old girl. Her mother was a prostitute, an alcoholic and sick with AIDS. When she started to grow physically weak and couldn’t get clients, she sold her youngest daughter to her pimp in order to pay for her drinking, and he sold her to a brothel. We received that information almost in real time, but nevertheless, by the time we got to the girl, she had already been raped by dozens of men. Another girl, whom we rescued when she was 11, had been abandoned by her father and by her mother, the sole provider, who sold her happily to a stranger. She remembers that on the train she heard the man say on the phone, “I am bringing a fresh body.” In other words, she was a virgin, so her value was higher. There are children who live on the street and are picked up there, and children who run away from home and are found by someone.</p> \n<p>There is always someone who is waiting.</p> \n<p>Always. Everywhere. People must understand this: There is always someone.</p> \n<p>As the founder of the organization, you are in charge of the operational side. I read an interview with you in which you admitted to being a crafty, highly resourceful person yourself, and that these qualities are useful in your work.</p> \n<p>I am capable of thinking exactly like a criminal. I can’t explain to you exactly what I do without giving away information that could be harmful to us, but I will say that we, too, make use of a great many manipulations, similar to the manipulations that they themselves use, only in the opposite direction. There’s no way to be saints. When you are fighting crime, you have to know all the strategies and stay one step ahead. We have to think like them, otherwise they will defeat us. Today all our rescue operations are carried out in cooperation with the police. We don’t act on our own. In fact, it’s a standard police operation in every respect: well planned and based on prior information.</p> \n<p>How do you collect the information?</p> \n<p>We have a vast network of informants, including the girls themselves. Every girl we rescue tells us about other girls who were taken, who are hidden. Sometimes it’s their sister, or a friend they once knew. We also work in cooperation with a movement of men who are fighting prostitution. They help us. They wander around, talk to the guards, to the pimps, to the clients, to the taxi drivers.</p> \n<p>So it’s a full-fledged intelligence operation.</p> \n<p>Intelligence is critical to the success of the operation. After the information reaches us, we send another team to authenticate it, because many times we are deliberately given false information. People try to set traps for us.</p> \n<p>How can you be certain? Do they enter the brothels themselves?</p> \n<p>They go to the actual places. Yes. They pretend not to be satisfied with the girls they’re shown; they say they want someone younger, prettier, taller, darker, etc., until they locate the girl that we know about.</p> \n<p>And if she’s not there?</p> \n<p>They go on playing the game. They make a scene, they say it’s a bad brothel, they get angry, and then they throw money on the table and leave, because once you enter you have to pay. If they don’t pay they could get into real trouble. As soon as we know about a particular girl, and know for certain where she is, we go to the police and plan her rescue.</p> \n<p>I saw a documentary that shows the police breaking into a brothel in Delhi. Some of the girls, it turns out, hid, or were hidden, in a closet with a double door. When the police discovered the closet, the girls refused to come out. A policeman crawled in and simply dragged them out. Girls of 12, maybe 14. As a viewer, you expect them to be happy to be rescued, but they looked miserable.</p> \n<p>They are not happy. No way. They know that the world has nothing to offer them. That society will reject them. We invest so much effort in rehabilitating them, risk our lives to rescue them, and then society pushes them out with all its might.</p> \n<p>That’s the paradox. In a country where the society is traditional and very conservative, the sex industry exists on a vast scale.</p> \n<p>What is truly astonishing, by the way, is that even society’s supposedly liberal segments reject these girls. These ostensibly enlightened people invite me to give talks and listen to me and applaud and shed a tear, but they would never employ a girl like that, who has undergone rehabilitation, in their home or their business. Certainly they will not allow her to get close to their children.</p> \n<p>What does the process that they undergo after the rescue look like?</p> \n<p>First of all, we treat them physically. They are all ill with sexually transmitted diseases. They are all addicted to drugs or alcohol or to some other substance, depending on the brothel they worked in, because when you are raped by dozens of men every day you can’t do it sober. You have to anesthetize yourself. They understand that, and their captors certainly understand it. Many of them suffer from serious damage to the external and internal sexual organs. Some of them suffer brain damage.</p> \n<p>Because of the physical blows.</p> \n<p>Yes. They are beaten cruelly on the head. All the time. About a third of them are HIV-positive, and in such a weak body, with a barely functioning immune system, the disease bursts out and progresses very rapidly. Only after they receive physical treatment is it possible to start working on the mental damage.</p> \n<p>How do you think they explain to themselves what happened to them at the brothel? They’re only girls, after all, and most of them would never have seen a man close-up before. Some of them led a relative protected life, despite the poverty.</p> \n<p>When they are inside the brothel they don’t think. They are just there. They are very drugged or very intoxicated. They work seven days a week, from 3 o’clock in the afternoon until 5 A.M. Then, when the shift ends, they are so exhausted and drugged that they simply collapse into sleep until they’re awakened for the next shift. Thinking is a privilege that the world of the brothel does not allow them. A girl who is used to having her body constantly invaded, whose consciousness is constantly being controlled, who is constantly beaten and threatened, disconnects. She no longer thinks about anything.</p> \n<p>She’s in a dissociative state.</p> \n<p>Yes. The disconnect continues after the rescue, in other ways, and even when she starts slowly to sober up and return to life, it’s still hard for her to understand that it was not her choice. It is still hard for her to imagine a life without drugs and alcohol, because she no longer remembers a reality in which she didn’t need them. The process of building trust in us is a very lengthy one. It’s only after half a year of intensive treatment that she starts to trust us and believe that we want what is best for her and for her wellbeing. Only then does she also start to talk about who hurt her and what happened to her, and her struggle for survival and rehabilitation begins.</p> \n<p>We teach her life skills. We give her practical instruction. The aspiration is to get her back into the labor market. Into society. It’s not an easy task. Employers have tremendous difficulty accepting girls like this. In the end, most of our girls succeed in finding a job. I push for education – that is the key, in my view. We also have a few girls who managed to go far, who are studying medicine, law. They truly came a long way.</p> \n<p>You speak of the violence to which these girls are subjected, but it hasn’t spared you, either. What you have chosen to do entails huge risks.</p> \n<p>I am facing organized crime and I cope with criminals. So of course there is violence – I have been beaten and attacked 17, maybe 18 times. I lost my hearing in one ear, I have permanent physical damage, acid has been thrown at me, people from our staff have been attacked, our offices were broken into and vandalized, we have been evicted from quite a few places because people don’t want to have anything to do with us. To me, that’s a sign that I am moving in the right direction. I understand that if what I am doing were not the real thing, if it was having no effect, I would not be targeted.</p> \n<p>A colleague of your was murdered before your eyes.</p> \n<p>That is a truly terrible story. He was a pimp who was rehabilitated, left the life of the street and devoted himself to our cause. He was very close to me and obtained a great deal of valuable information for us. In the end, they apparently realized that the information was coming from him. We were on the way to a rescue operation when we were attacked and he was stabbed to death before my eyes.</p> \n<p>You are exposed to so much suffering and pain. You made a courageous choice, but the cost is so high.</p> \n<p>What helps me get out of bed in the morning is those girls. When I see them smiling, moving about, progressing, and I understand that they actually have no reason to trust the world, no reason to believe that things will be good one day. They were betrayed in every possible way, by everyone they encountered, and yet they are smiling. They trust me. That’s a feeling I can’t explain. It’s tremendous inspiration for me. If a girl like that can forget and forgive, I certainly can’t complain.</p> \n<p>Let’s imagine that the whole world could hear you – what would you want to say?</p> \n<p>I think the time has come for a deep transformation in male thinking, among men everywhere in the world. I think that the conception of sexual consumerism as something legitimate has to change, and it can change only through education.</p> \n<p>You don’t think the sex industry has long since become irreversible?</p> \n<p>Everything can change.</p> \n<p>You believe that? After everything you’ve seen and experienced?</p> \n<p>Yes. What we have here is actually the supply side, the demand side, and in the middle is organized crime. If the demand side decreases, the whole equation will collapse. We need to ask ourselves how to educate our children to understand that paid sex is neither acceptable nor legitimate. That it’s cruelty per se. It’s a matter of a collective human conscience. A collective consciousness. If we all stand together and say, “No more,” it will end. What humanity created, it can also destroy.</p>",

As a result, Israelis came to believe that pulling out of the West Bank would endanger their security. This fear is genuine and totally legitimate.</p> \n<p>It is also worth noting that the Palestinians have rejected all peace offers that were made to them over the last 18 years.

We can’t make the same mistake now,” June 28) Jonathan Tobin asserts incorrectly that I drew “Holocaust analogies” (my analysis was confined to the persecution of the Jews in 1930s, not genocide in the 1940s) and addressed not a single one of my substantive points. He merely used the article to launch a defense of Trump as “a conventional conservative,” who has done “things any Republican would have done.” (His most ardent supporters don’t believe that, which is why they are his ardent supporters.)</p> \n<p>Indeed, Trump has done some things any Republican would have done, such as select a conservative nominee for the Supreme Court. (Of course, most Republican presidents haven’t shunned American Bar Association recommendations and nominated many patently unqualified lower court judges as Trump has done.) But he’s also done a great many things outside the bounds of American politics upon which his critics rightly focus.</p> \n<p>Tobin describes what Trump hasn’t done (imposed legal limits on freedom of the press, for example) and ignores what he has – relentlessly and viciously attacked journalists and journalism. Even if, as Tobin asserts, “all border security measures – and not just the cruel ones – are demonized” by the left, “the cruel ones” are the point.</p> \n<p>Significantly, Tobin doesn’t mention the policy that provoked “incivility” toward members of the Trump administration – the separation of children from their parents at the border.

        "text":["<p>Why was the nation-state law necessary?</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought to have the bill passed to enshrine the concept that “Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people” as a basic law, meaning one that has quasi-constitutional status. The prime minister has also demanded that the Palestinian Authority acknowledge this aspect of Israel’s character as a condition for a future peace agreement with it.</p> \n<p>The new law, which was passed by the Knesset early Thursday morning, is also designed to alter the application of the Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty in court rulings, and permit judges to give priority to Israel’s Jewish character in their rulings. The government coalition tried to get a more sweeping version of the nation-state bill passed, which would have brought about more significant change.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's ultra-Orthodox establishment is consolidating its power&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Nation-state bill heralds the end of Israel as a Jewish, democratic State&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;As an Arab, I support Israel's Jewish nation-state bill&nbsp;| Opinion ■&nbsp;The Israel you know just ended. You can thank Netanyahu&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Before the text of the bill was softened, the bill would have conferred prime standing to the country’s Jewish national values and subordinate its democratic values to them. In addition, the original version included a provision that would have permitted the creation of Jewish-only communities, but that was significantly modulated. In May, another controversial provision, which would have had courts refer to traditional Jewish religious law, halakha, on matters that existing law does not address, was dropped.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Nation-state law builds up 'racist laws' against non-Jews, top Palestinian official says</p> \n<p>In the end, the law that was passed enshrines a collection of declarations regarding the country’s commitment to its citizens and to Jews in the Diaspora, regarding the status of Israeli Arabs and with regard to state symbols. The words “democracy and “equality” do not appear at all in the law.</p> \n<p>How have we managed up to now without the law?</p> \n<p>The nation-state law is mainly a symbolic measure designed to enshrine national values in a basic law. Most of its provisions were already on the law books and have been restated in the new law from existing legislation. The appearance of the Israeli flag, the national anthem “Hatikva” and the state symbol were already the subject of a law from 1949. The provision declaring Jerusalem as Israel’s capital was incorporated in full from the Basic Law on Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel. And the section on reference by the courts to Jewish religious law, which was ultimately dropped, already appears in the law on the foundations of the legal system.</p> \n<p>How will the law affect the lives of Israelis?</p> \n<p>There is nothing in the nation-state law that was passed that involves provisions subject to practical application, so its impact will now be up to the Israeli government and the policies that it adopts in the spirit of the law. The new legislation could provide support for a series of controversial government decisions.</p> \n<p>For example, because, at the demand of the ultra-Orthodox parties, the nation-state law calls for the state to maintain the ties with Jews in the Diaspora but does not mention a similar commitment within Israel, so the government could evade carrying out plans for the pluralist Jewish prayer area at the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>Another possibility is that the new law could spur revival of the campaign to boost the Jewish population of the Negev and Galilee by establishing communities with a Jewish character, based on the nation-state law’s provision that the state “views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will work to encourage and advance its establishment and consolidation.”</p> \n<p>Could the law bar Arab Israelis from living in Jewish locales?</p> \n<p>No. The version that would have permitted the establishment of Jewish-only communities was deleted from the final legislation. Deputy Attorney General Raz Nizri said this week that the final version would not prevent Arabs from buying homes or living in communities planned for Jews, but he noted that the final bill does have a provision that would make it possible to provide incentives for constructing communities with a clearly Jewish character.</p> \n<p>“It will not be possible to create a city and designate it as a ‘Jewish city,’” Nizri said, “but if public buildings are constructed, they will be for synagogues and not mosques. That doesn’t mean that an Israeli Arab will be barred from buying a home in the new city.”</p> \n<p>In practice, how will the status of the Arabic language be affected?</p> \n<p>As a practical matter, the nation-state law provides that there will be no change whatsoever in the existing status of Arabic. Therefore the obligation to post signs that include Arabic will remain and government documents will continue to be issued in Arabic. The law provides that Hebrew is the “state language” and confers a lower “special status” on Arabic, and also states that regulations on its use in state institutions will be provided for in subsequent legislation.</p> \n<p>Knesset members from the predominantly Arab Joint List faction said the final version of the law harms their efforts to boost the status of Arabic and to advance legislation that would require that television broadcasts and movies be subtitled in Arabic.</p> \n<p>How will the provision of the nation-state law declaring Jerusalem as Israel’s capital affect the city?</p> \n<p>The clause states that the “whole and united Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.” In practice, this won’t change the status of the city or its neighborhoods or how the Education Ministry or Jerusalem municipality relate to Arab neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>Could the law do harm to Israel’s international standing?</p> \n<p>The international community and Diaspora Jews applied heavy pressure on Israel not to pass the original version of the bill, saying that it would harm minorities as well as ties with American Jewry and Jewish communities in other countries. Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit considered the possible harm to Israel’s standing and the final version was considerably toned down at his request.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BUDAPEST – In recent months, activists and journalists are suspicious whenever they receive an email from an Israeli or hear a Hebrew-speaking voice from an unknown number on their phone. They carry out background checks and verify identities through multiple social media platforms before agreeing to meet.</p> \n<p>Their suspicions are well-founded. Right-wing newspapers in Hungary and Israel have carried reports and damning quotes from employees of civil rights NGOs, allegedly working with European partners in trying to influence legislation in the Hungarian parliament. It has all fed into the hysteria being whipped up by Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n’s Fidesz party against refugees and those trying to help them. Earlier this month, Politico revealed that the Israeli company Black Cube carried out a sting operation designed to smear the nonprofits ahead of April’s parliamentary election.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Part I:&nbsp;Orb&aacute;n Is Coming to Israel to Meet His Soulmate Netanyahu. Here’s How He’s Taking Down Hungary’s Democracy</p> \n<p>“The woman who called me and offered to pay me for speaking at a conference said she was Spanish, but had an Israeli accent,” one target of the sting operation tells Haaretz. “That wasn’t the only thing that made me suspicious, of course. She was offering me 5,000 euros [$5,815] to give one lecture. That’s more than I make in a year.”</p> \n<p>The reputation of Black Cube and other commercial surveillance companies founded by alumni of Israel’s intelligence community isn’t the only reason Hungarian activists are wary of talking to Israelis. In Budapest’s corridors of power and among the city’s close-knit communities of journalists, activists and Israeli expats, there is a consensus that the Hungarian government’s relations with Jerusalem have never been more intense. And that was true long before Wednesday evening, when Orb&aacute;n arrived in Israel on his first official visit&nbsp;to the country.</p> \n<p>“If you want to understand Bibi, look at Orb&aacute;n. And vice versa,” says one Budapest resident who has spent time with both the Hungarian and Israeli prime ministers. Indeed, the parallels between Benjamin Netanyahu and Orb&aacute;n are breathtaking. Both men first came to power in the 1990s, as the youngest prime ministers in their countries’ histories. Both lost an election after only one term in office and then spent nearly a decade in opposition. Both subsequently returned to the Prime Minister’s Office and have since won three consecutive elections using xenophobia, a siege mentality and the weakness of their liberal-left rivals to perpetuate and deepen their hold on power.</p> \n<p>The similarities don’t end there. Netanyahu and Orb&aacute;n both lead relatively small nations, each with some 9 million citizens. Yet despite their size, each leader has leveraged his position: Netanyahu into that of a global statesman who has the ear of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin; Orb&aacute;n as the figurehead for other nationalist and populist politicians who are disrupting the policies of the European Union’s Brussels establishment. Netanyahu and Orb&aacute;n, veterans of three decades of politics, were both harbingers of the Trump era.</p> \n<p>‘Political pragmatism’</p> \n<p>Hungarians on the right and left find very little common ground these days, but both supporters and opponents of Orb&aacute;n are in clear agreement that he and Bibi are close. “Orb&aacute;n and Netanyahu have joint values,” says the Hungarian government’s spokesman, Zolt&aacute;n Kov&aacute;cs. “They share political pragmatism instead of dogmatic ideology. You can see it’s working. These two nations are facing similar challenges with similar solutions.”</p> \n<p>Kov&aacute;cs, who was a historian before he went into politics, has a point. Hungarians and Israelis share similar geopolitical circumstances: Small nations with a unique language and culture, nestling between much larger regional powers and national groups, and with aspirations to punch far above their weight. Both Netanyahu and Orb&aacute;n have a keen understanding of their respective nations’ histories and have been very adept at using it to their political advantage in domestic politics and, increasingly, on the global stage.</p> \n<p>This is Orb&aacute;n’s first official visit to Israel as prime minister, following Netanyahu’s first official visit to Budapest last July. But the two have known each other for over a decade, sharing a web of political contacts and advisers reaching from Jerusalem to Washington. Orb&aacute;n has visited Jerusalem in a private capacity at least twice before, once when both men were in opposition a decade ago.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Part II:&nbsp;With Orb&aacute;n and Soros, Hungary's Jews Trapped Between Pro-Israel and Anti-Semitic Politics</p> \n<p>“They have given each other advice on political messaging – including on what phrases to use in speeches,” says one senior Israeli official. “And, of course, Bibi introduced Orb&aacute;n to Finkelstein.”</p> \n<p>The legendary political strategist Arthur Finkelstein – master of the dark arts of negative campaigning, who created Netanyahu’s devastatingly effective “Peres will divide Jerusalem” slogan in the 1996 election – was recommended to Orb&aacute;n and masterminded his 2010 reelection campaign. The New York State-based Finkelstein, who passed away last year, only made short, usually secret, appearances in the countries where he advised. But he would send his associates to supervise matters up close. The man Finkelstein sent as project manager for the 2010 Orb&aacute;n campaign was his partner, George Birnbaum, who had previously lived in Israel and worked for Netanyahu as a senior aide in the ’90s. Members of the Chabad synagogue in central Budapest remember the Orthodox Birnbaum going there for prayers and Shabbat lunch, so he could be in walking distance of Orb&aacute;n’s Saturday rallies.</p> \n<p>Ties have been ongoing between Likud and Fidesz at various levels for years, with delegations from both parties visiting each other. A whole range of advisers, businesspeople and religious leaders also profit from the relationship. “I never imagined how tangled the web between Netanyahu and Orb&aacute;n was,” says a senior Israeli official who recently worked on an issue of concern to both countries. “But the moment I became involved, I realized just how many millionaires and rabbis and opinion-makers are shuttling between Jerusalem and Budapest.” Ultimately, though, the relationship is down to the two leaders.</p> \n<p>Combative stance</p> \n<p>Early in his political career, Orb&aacute;n presented himself as a center-right and even liberal politician. But he took a sharp turn rightward in 2009 and began ruthlessly playing the nationalist card. Netanyahu’s career has pursued a similar trajectory (Likud still called itself a “national-liberal party” until quite recently).</p> \n<p>In both cases, the influence of Finkelstein – who once said his proudest achievement was having made the term “liberal” a dirty word in American politics – can be discerned. His political style of distilling entire campaigns into a few “catch words,” playing on the voters’ prejudices and deepest phobias, were as effective in Hungary and Israel as they were in the United States.</p> \n<p>For most of their relationship, Netanyahu – who is nearly 14 years older – was the senior and more prominent partner. But over the last two years, as new populist politicians have come to the fore in Europe and the United States, Orb&aacute;n’s stature has grown and they are more equal today. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Netanyahu – who believed Hillary Clinton would win and was anyway wary of Trump’s unpredictability – remained firmly on the fence. Orb&aacute;n, on the other hand, didn’t hide his preference for Trump, expressing support for his policies during the election. Netanyahu also took cues from Orb&aacute;n, trying in recent months to use the issue of asylum seekers in Israel as a rallying point for the Likud base, with tactics borrowed from Orb&aacute;n’s weaponization of Europe’s refugee crisis to boost his own flagging popularity in 2015.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has also been encouraged by Orb&aacute;n’s combative stance toward the mainstream establishment of the EU and the most influential EU leader, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The governments of Israel and Hungary both have a complicated dual relationship with the EU and Germany.</p> \n<p>EU membership is essential to a small landlocked country like Hungary. Its economy needs to be part of the EU’s trading network, and a large chunk of Hungary’s GDP is generated by the output of German-owned companies and factories in its territory. EU grants constitute a major part of the Hungarian government’s budget, while the money sent home by hundreds of thousands of Hungarian citizens, who have moved to wealthier EU countries to live and work, is vital to many families. Conversely, the EU has been highly critical of the Orb&aacute;n government’s policies of cracking down on the media, stacking the courts with pro-Fidesz judges and closing off the border to asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>“Germany is a major economic factor for Hungary and the EU cohesion funds give them a major boost as well. Hungary is basically a link in the German supply chain,” explains Karen Vartapetov, a senior analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s ratings agency. “The Orb&aacute;n government policy is full of contradictions, both pro- and anti-EU, so they prefer to call it anti-Brussels. And they are part of the German economy while being hypercritical of Merkel.”</p> \n<p>‘A key ally’</p> \n<p>Israel, while not an EU member like Hungary, has a similar predicament. The EU is its largest trading partner and the source of hundreds of millions of euros-worth of research and economic grants yearly. But Brussels is also the source of much of the criticism of Israeli policies and was at the forefront of opposition to two key recent decisions by the Trump administration: the United States pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal; and moving its embassy to Jerusalem. The relationship with Germany is also uneasy, with Merkel expressing a clear commitment to Israel’s security – by subsidizing the purchase of German submarines and missile boats for Israel’s navy – while also encouraging EU hostility to Netanyahu’s policies.</p> \n<p>In response, Netanyahu has adopted the Orb&aacute;n approach. While he is pro-EU whenever it comes to trade relations, he and his ministers have become increasingly aggressive when it comes to politics. This included refusing to meet with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini when she was scheduled to be in Jerusalem for a conference last month (Mogherini canceled her arrival as a result). And, just like Orb&aacute;n, he will never criticize Merkel in public, but is increasingly criticizing her policies and courting her opponents in Europe.</p> \n<p>“Major changes are happening in Europe. It is becoming less liberal and more nationalist,” says a senior Israeli diplomat. “Orb&aacute;n is leading this change and Netanyahu has identified him as a key ally.”</p> \n<p>Change can’t happen fast enough for either of them. Under the Obama administration, Orb&aacute;n’s government was frozen out due to corruption allegations against senior Hungarian officials and the prime minister’s closeness to Russian President Putin. Despite Orb&aacute;n’s affinity with Trump, he wasn’t high on the new administration’s priority list. “The message that Orb&aacute;n is in the Trump camp didn’t filter down fast enough to the State Department,” says a well-connected official in Budapest. “Bureaucracies are slow everywhere and Orb&aacute;n looked to Netanyahu to help him out with that.”</p> \n<p>But Orb&aacute;n didn’t wait for Netanyahu to pull Israeli levers in Washington. Early in 2017, the Hungarian government hired two Israelis to work for them in D.C.: Tzvika Brot, a former journalist and now Likud’s mayoral candidate for Bat Yam (a suburb of Tel Aviv); and Ariel Sender, a veteran lobbyist and former adviser to right-wing politicians in Israel. Their company led the Republican Party’s outreach to U.S. citizens living in Israel in the 2016 election, and they also received a $45,000 monthly retainer to lobby for Orb&aacute;n in Washington.</p> \n<p>Those efforts weren’t enough, though: During Netanyahu’s visit to Budapest last year, Orb&aacute;n asked for assistance, and Israel’s ambassador and Netanyahu confidant Ron Dermer was set to work on opening doors to the administration.</p> \n<p>Common goal</p> \n<p>All the Israeli lobbying seems to have helped. In May, the first high-level meeting in years between Hungarian and U.S. officials took place when Orb&aacute;n’s foreign minister, P&eacute;ter Szijj&aacute;rt&oacute; (also accompanying Orb&aacute;n on his visit to Israel), met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. The meeting was effective in many ways. In the buildup to and during last week’s NATO leaders’ summit in Brussels, Trump was suddenly using an old talking point that was originally made by Orb&aacute;n. Responding to criticism of his own closeness to Putin, Trump accused Germany of being “a captive of Russia,” due to the Russian natural gas it purchases.</p> \n<p>Trump echoed his newfound love of Orb&aacute;n’s ideology in an interview he gave in Britain over the weekend, where he said that immigration to Europe has led to a rise in crime levels “in some places that have never had crime. I’m not going to mention specific countries, but you can pick the country and you can see what’s happening. Some of the countries would not take it. And they’re being really admonished by the European Union for not doing it.</p> \n<p>“You look at Hungary as an example,” he continued. “They’re not agreeing to do what some of the other countries did. Now it’s a very tough thing, on a humanitarian basis you’ve got to do something, and yet it is changing Europe. It’s seriously changing Europe.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, Trump and Orb&aacute;n now share a common goal in disrupting EU policy. For that, Netanyahu has been courting not only Orb&aacute;n but the Visegr&aacute;d Four (whose other members are Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia). To secure the support of the Visegr&aacute;d governments, Netanyahu was willing last year to reject the Hungarian-Jewish community’s appeal for support in its demand that the Orb&aacute;n government stop its anti-Semitic campaign against the Hungarian-born Jewish-American financier George Soros. And only three weeks ago he signed a joint statement with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, absolving Poland or the Polish nation as a whole “for the atrocities committed by the Nazis and their collaborators of different nations.” This statement led to an unprecedented announcement by historians at Yad Vashem, who rejected Netanyahu-Morawiecki’s Holocaust revisionism.</p> \n<p>In return, along with other like-minded EU members, Orb&aacute;n has obstructed EU condemnations of Israel on various matters, as well as a condemnation of the U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem. He is now trying to get his Visegr&aacute;d colleagues to agree to hold a five-way summit in Jerusalem next year (like the one Netanyahu attended last year in Budapest). Netanyahu is hoping the four Central European countries will defy the joint EU policy and agree to follow the Trump administration in moving their embassies to Jerusalem, but that may be a bridge too far for them at present.</p> \n<p>Officially, Hungary is still sticking to the EU position of supporting the two-state solution and not recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But while he is in Israel this week, Orb&aacute;n will make another gesture by visiting the Western Wall in Jerusalem. And he will be defying EU practice, if not official policy, by not including a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah on his schedule as well. “We didn’t get an invitation from the Palestinians,” was the blank-faced explanation offered by Kov&aacute;cs, Orb&aacute;n’s spokesman.</p> \n<p>Even if Netanyahu doesn’t get the formal recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital during this visit, both leaders still believe they have a long and mutually beneficial relationship ahead of them. With Trump’s help, they both intend to remain figureheads for the new populist wave of Western politics for years to come.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Call it a coincidence or a conspiracy, or simply a sign of the political times - but three events that over less than 48 hours, must be taken together as sending a disturbingly strong message: the country’s ultra-Orthodox religious establishment is ready to use its considerable power to fend off any threat to its monopoly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>First, prominent religious-Zionist and ultra-Orthodox rabbis held a massive pow-wow called “One Conversion for One People,” aimed at demolishing a piece of legislation that threatens to break their monopoly on conversions to Judaism.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Nation-state bill heralds the end of Israel as a Jewish, democratic State&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;As an Arab, I support Israel's Jewish nation-state bill&nbsp;| Opinion ■&nbsp;Israel's nation-state bill betrays insecurity about its right to the land&nbsp;■&nbsp;The Israel you know just ended. You can thank Netanyahu</p> \n<p>The dreaded proposal recommended establishing a new state-run Orthodox authority independent of the Chief Rabbinate to take on the formidable task of converting the hundreds of thousands of Israelis - mostly immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their families - who remain officially “without religion.” This population, most of whom consider themselves Jewish and are fully contributing members of Israeli society have refused to subject themselves to the difficult and often humiliating process of converting to Judaism under the auspices of the Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>Then, less than forty-eight hours after the conference, police in Israel roused Conservative Rabbi Dov Haiyun from his bed in Haifa, dragging him to the police station to be questioned for having allegedly committed the crime of performing a wedding ceremony outside the country’s Rabbinate. Haiyun &quot;marrying those who are not eligible to be married&quot; - a couple, one of whom had been forbidden by the Rabbinate from marrying because of carrying the status of “mamzer.”</p> \n<p>Officially, Haiyun, along with rabbis across the country committed a crime which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison. Why he was singled out is still unclear. But it marked the first time the authorities have ever taken any steps to enforce the 2013 law that forbids performing weddings outside the Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>The third event - the passage of the nation-state bill, which was done in a way that would legitimize killing liberalized conversion, marriage or anything else with a whiff of Jewish pluralism.</p> \n<p>In the negotiations over the nation-state bill, the ultra-Orthodox parties honed in on one clause. In the version of the bill originally under consideration, the clause read: “The state will work to preserve the affinity between [Israel] and the Jewish people everywhere.”</p> \n<p>They insisted that it be changed to: “The state will work in the Diaspora to preserve the affinity between [Israel] and the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>With the switch of a few words, the message was sent that the state of Israel was only committed to the unity of the Jewish people outside its borders.</p> \n<p>Within the state, the ultra-Orthodox rabbinic monopoly wanted to make it clear that there was only one officially approved form of practicing Judaism in Israel - their kind.</p> \n<p>Enshrining this principle in a Basic Law, which is supposed to reflect the foundational values of the state, distressed North American Diaspora Jewry greatly that they sent top leaders to argue against it.</p> \n<p>The effort proved unsuccessful - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to put the kind of pressure on the ultra-Orthodox parties the way he had leaned on the Habayit Hayehudi party to drop its insistence on the “gated communities clause.”</p> \n<p>It was yet another sign that the leader of what is now officially the &quot;Jewish Nation State” cares little for the concerns of the non-Orthodox and modern Orthodox Jews who live outside it - as well as the embattled minority of Jews in the country who, under increasingly difficult circumstance, continue to believe that there is more than one way to observe their religion.</p>",

You can thank Netanyahu</p> \n<p>Immediately after the law passed, Arab lawmakers tore copies in protest, and were subsequently removed from the Knesset plenum hall. Lawmaker Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, released a statement saying that Israel &quot;declared it does not want us here&quot; and that it had &quot;passed a law of Jewish supremacy and told us that we will always be second-class citiziens.&quot;</p> \n<p>Speaking moments after the bill passed into law, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: &quot;This is a defining moment&nbsp;–&nbsp;long live the State of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu further said that &quot;122 years after Herzl made his vision known, with this law we determined the founding principle of our existence. Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people, and respects the rights of all of its citizens.&quot;</p> \n<p>The prime minister also said that &quot;in the Middle East, only Israel respects [rights]. This is our country, the Jewish state. In recent years there have been those who have tried to undermine that and question the principles of our existence. Today we made it into law: This is the country, the language, the anthem and flag.&quot;</p> \n<p>As they left the Knesset plenum, Arab MKs from the Joint List party confronted Netanyahu. MK Ahmad Tibi and MK Ayeda Touma-Souliman yelled at Netanyahu: &quot;You passed an apartheid law, a racist law.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>MK Tibi lashed at Netanyahu: &quot;Why are you afraid of the Arabic language?&quot; The premier retorted by saying: &quot;How dare you talk this way about the only democracy in the Middle East?&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Opposition head Isaac Herzog also spoke up at the plenum, saying that &quot;it's a little sad to me that the last speech I make will be against this kind of backdrop. The question is whether the law will harm or benefit Israel. History will determine. I really hope that we won't find the fine balance between a Jewish and democratic state to be hurt.&quot;</p> \n<p>The sponsor of the bill, MK Avi Dichter, said during debates that took place prior to the vote that &quot;unlike the disinformation and fake news that were tossed around [regarding the bill], this basic law doesn't hurt the culture of minorities living in Israel, doesn't hurt their sabbaticals and holidays and certainly doesn't hurt the Arabic language, which remains a mother tongue for 1.5 million of Israel's citizens.&quot;</p> \n<p>The draft bill the Knesset voted on is fundamentally different form the version the coalition had sought to advance in the past decade. Its main clauses were moderated following pressure within the coalition ranks and beyond.</p> \n<p>Initially, the bill was intended to significantly limit the discretion of Supreme Court justices’ decisions, requiring them to set the state’s Jewish character above its democratic character in rulings where the two clashed. This clause was removed from the bill already in May.</p> \n<p>The most controversial clause, which appeared to pave the way for the creation of communities segregated by nationality or religion, was removed from the legislation earlier this week.</p> \n<p>The nation-state law establishes as a basic law, or quasi-constitutional law, a set of values, some of which already appear in existing laws. The law stipulates that Israel is the Jewish nation’s historic homeland and that this nation has the singular right to national self-determination in it. The law anchors the flag, menorah, &quot;Hatikva&quot; anthem, Hebrew calendar, Independence Day and Jewish holidays as national symbols.</p> \n<p>The law states that the “whole and united” Jerusalem is the state’s capital, which appears today in Basic Law: Jerusalem. The nation-state law further grants the status of an official language only to Hebrew.</p> \n<p>Another controversial clause stipulates that the state will invest resources in preserving Israel’s affiliation to world Jewry, but not in Israel. This wording was demanded by the ultra-Orthodox parties to prevent the state from linking up with the Reform and Conservative communities in Israel.</p> \n<p>Adalah Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, released in response: &quot;The nation-state law is a colonial law with features of apartheid, which is prohibited by international law because it contradicts the international treaty that bans apartheid crimes. It creates various avenues for segregation in land and housing and incentives based on the principle of 'advancing Jewish settlement' both in civil life and in obtaining citizenship based on the law of return and in language and in cultural rights in the name of self-definition.&quot;</p> \n<p>As part of the protest against the law, Peace Now activists waved a black flag in the Knesset balcony during the debate, until security guards made them leave the room. Joint List chairman Ayman Odeh also raised a black flag during the debate against the legislation.</p> \n<p>“As [the 1956 massacre] in Kafr Qassem was a blatantly illegal order, with a black flag over it, so is a black flag hoisted over this evil law,” he said.</p> \n<p>J Street's president and founder, Jeremy Ben-Ami, harshly criticized the nation-state bill and Netanyahu's government: &quot;It was born in sin, its only purpose is to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens. Two months ago&nbsp;we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Israeli&nbsp;Declaration of Independence, where it was written that the State of Israel 'will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or gender.' Today Netanyahu's government is trying to ignore those words and the values that they represent.&quot;</p> \n<p>On Monday, Netanyahu said the bill was “very important to guarantee the foundations of our existence, which is Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people”&nbsp;– though critics say he is mainly keen to drum up support before the next Knesset election, due by November next year.</p>",

He was detained following a complaint filed against him by the Rabbinical Court in Haifa for allegedly &quot;marrying those who are not eligible to be married.&quot;</p> \n<p>The incident was the first time police attempted to enforce a 2013 law forbidding performing weddings outside the Rabbinate, a law carrying a sentence of up to two years in prison.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Subscribe to Haaretz today, save 25% - and stay updated on everything important</p> \n<p>Haiyun was taken to a police station and released after signing a document promising to report for questioning on Monday.</p> \n<p>Following the reports, Attorney General instructed police not to question Haiyun.&nbsp;Police דubsequently&nbsp;told Haiyun that he would not need to return for questioning, as he was asked to do on Thursday. He will instead be summoned if necessary, police said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haiyun said was awoken by policemen knocking on his door without warning at 5:30 A.M. &quot;Unfortunately, the nice young policemen serve as tools for the ayatollahs in Israel,&quot; he said. He signed a statement promising to return on Monday, he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While at the police station, Haiyun wrote a Facebook post declaring that &quot;Iran is already here!!!&quot; and urging people to share the post.</p> \n<p>Police said Haiyun had been asked to come in for questioning on Wednesday and failed to do so, prompting investigators to go to his home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;If they arrest me, they need to arrest everyone who conducts non-Orthodox weddings, including MK Yair Lapid and [media personality] Avri Gilad,&quot; Haiyun said, adding that he performs wedding in compliance with Jewish law. &quot;There is no deception here and everyone who comes to me knows about it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Haiyn added that &quot;it's not pleasant to be dragged out of bed and interrogated over carrying out weddings according to Jewish law. I'm not a criminal or a murderer,&quot; said the rabbi, whose congregation is the oldest Conservative synagogue in Israel.</p> \n<p>The complaint against Haiyun that prompted police involvement was apparently a wedding he conducted two years ago for a woman whom the Rabbinate ruled was ineligible for marriage according to Jewish law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, slammed the police action as &quot;an outrage that shows how drunk with power the Rabbinical Court is.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Reform Movement in Israel demanded that the attorney general put a stop to the &quot;disgraceful&quot; investigation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The investigation is another sign of the belligerence&nbsp; displayed by the Israeli Rabbinate - backed by elements in government - toward Conservative and Reform Judaism, the Reform movement said. It added that this aggressive behavior will not deter it: ultimately it will lead the Orthodox monopoly to collapse, the Reform movement said.</p> \n<p>Haiyun's lawyer, Rabbi Uri Regev -- who heads the movement for religious freedom and equality Hiddush -- said he planned to vigorously protest to the attorney general and the police the fact that law enforcement has been placed at the disposal of the Rabbinate in its struggle against religious freedom and freedom of conscience in Israel.</p> \n<p>Uri Keidar, executive director of Israel Hofsheet (&quot;Be Free Israel&quot;), said: &quot;Every year tens of thousands of Israelis marry outside the Rabbinate, voting no-confidence in this corrupt institution, which only exists by virtue of cowardly politicians afraid to show leadership, and enable civil marriage in Israel,&quot; Keidar said. &quot;The only option is to immediately create a civil marriage law. We have no more time for bypasses. A bill to enable civil marriage will be presented to the Knesset at the very start of the winter session. We will see who supports Israelis and who supports the Rabbinate.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Rabbincial Courts Authority said in response: &quot;At issue is a person who married those who are not eligible to be married, which is a criminal offense.&quot;&nbsp;The Authority added that Haiyun married a couple, one of whom was a&nbsp;mamzer&nbsp;(a person born from certain forbidden relationships and who is therefore banned from marrying according to halakha.)</p> \n<p>The Israel Police responded that it was enforcing the law and that any complaints about the issue should be directed at those who decide on the law and not those who are bound to enforce it.</p> \n<p>According to the 2013 law, a person who officiates at the wedding of a couple that is not authorized [by the Rabbinate] to marry can be sentenced to six months in prison. In addition a person who conducts a wedding is legally bound to register it and failure to do is an offense that carries a two-year prison sentence.</p> \n<p>A source at the Rabbincal Courts Authority told Haaretz that in the past most of the complaints about failure to register marriages were directed at Orthodox rabbis, but the police have been lax in following up. &quot;This time the police were very efficient -- it's not clear why,&quot; said the source.</p> \n<p>One senior rabbi said that the 2013 law was meant to deal with only Orthodox wedding ceremonies -- and not Conservative or Reform ones, which have no legal standing in Israel anyway. Couples in Israel who marry with a Reform or Conservative rabbi officiating are not considered married, unless they supplement that symbolic wedding with a civil marriage abroad after which they are registered by the state as married.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Founded in 1954, Moriah Congregation is the oldest Conservative synagogue in Israel and describes itself as a halakhic, egalitarian place of worship.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>No one can deny that IfNotNow makes a lot of noise. What is less clear is whether it makes a lot of sense. But many of its members are serious people, and they deserve a serious response.</p> \n<p>For those who do not know, IfNotNow is an anti-occupation group made up mostly of millennials. It has no position on whether or not there should be a Jewish state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of its major projects is its &quot;You Never Told Me&quot; campaign, which calls on Jewish educational organizations and institutions to include information about the occupation in their teachings about Israel.</p> \n<p>This month it protested at a gala dinner celebrating Birthright, which provides free trips to Israel for young Jewish men and women. Last November, it rallied outside the Jewish Theological Seminary, demanding that the Conservative movement’s Camp Ramah system begin talking about the occupation at their camps.</p> \n<p>It’s also demonstrated outside the AIPAC conference, at U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman’s confirmation hearing, and tried to block last year’s 'Celebrate Israel' parade in New York.</p> \n<p>The Reform movement too has IfNotNow sympathizers in its ranks, and as a former Reform leader who is both dovish on territorial issues and a critic of IfNotNow, I hear from them from time to time. Below is one of the questions that I received and my answer.</p> \n<p>Question: You’ve been outspoken in the past with criticism of IfNotNow, a movement led by millennial Jews working to end the American Jewish community’s support for the occupation.</p> \n<p>Since you wrote an op-ed in Haaretz in 2016 (IfNotNow Doesn't Deserve the Support of Left-leaning American Jews), IfNotNow has grown, and some of its members have&nbsp;shared stories of disappointment in the one-sided Israel education that they received as young people in the Reform movement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What would you say to a millennial who feels betrayed by the education about Israel/Palestine they received? Do you believe Israel educators should make a concerted effort to teach Palestinian narratives about the Occupation?</p> \n<p>Answer: Your question raises several critical issues.</p> \n<p>First, if a young Reform Jew told me that he or she felt betrayed by the education about Israel/Palestine she had received, I would want to hear the specifics.</p> \n<p>In my experience, there are wild disparities in how Israel is taught in Reform schools and camps. Some of our educational institutions do a very good job teaching about Israel, but others do not.</p> \n<p>And that is particularly true when it comes to teaching about the realities of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank since 1967.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are many reasons for this disparity. There is a natural tendency among Jews to emphasize the positive dimensions of Israel rather than her problems.</p> \n<p>The occupation is a difficult subject and not easy to teach even by experienced teachers. And the fact is that many of our teachers and camp counselors are not experienced educators but enthusiastic volunteers, lacking the sophistication required for instruction about post-1967 Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another factor is that we have many more younger children than older children in our educational system, and elementary age children cannot readily comprehend what the occupation is about.</p> \n<p>It must also be acknowledged that many parts of the Jewish community, including segments of the Reform community, have simply not come to grips with the occupation: They have not thought through its implications and see it as a problem best avoided, rather than honestly confronted.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Secondly, I would make it clear that I have no problem with anyone who is a critic of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank. I am a lover of Israel and a Zionist, but also a frequent critic of the occupation. The Israeli political leaders whom I most admire are also critics of the occupation. Even if the occupation started because of Arab attacks on Israel (and it did), and even if most of the occupiers try to be humane in their approach to those whose lives they control, no occupation can remain benevolent.</p> \n<p>That is why I desperately want the occupation to end. But while I am committed to a two-state solution that will enable Israel to remain both Jewish and democratic, I see little chance that such a solution will come about soon. Palestinian, Israeli, and American leaders are all failing to do what needs to be done.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This means that, for a while at least, the occupation will endure. And I know that as time passes, Israel’s occupation will continue to do what every occupation does: Corrupt the occupiers and oppress the occupied.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It is important, therefore, that Jewish educators find a way to discuss this situation, especially when dealing with children who are old enough to understand. Of course, it is also critically important that other things be taught about the Jewish state - that it is a cause for rejoicing and thanksgiving that has returned the Jewish people to history; that without Israel, we are a truncated, incomplete people; and that while criticizing Israel is always acceptable, distancing oneself from Israel is not.</p> \n<p>Third, if asked about &quot;Palestinian narratives,&quot; I would make it clear that I don’t believe in teaching &quot;Palestinian narratives&quot; about the occupation, just as I don’t believe in teaching &quot;Israeli narratives&quot; about the occupation. I believe in teaching objective facts about the history of the conflict. Only this should be taught in synagogue schools, in Israeli schools, in Palestinian schools, and in every other venue where the Middle Eastern conflict is discussed.</p> \n<p>Zionists such as I do not fear teaching the objective truth. We know that Israeli leaders have made mistakes and in some cases grave moral errors. And we are not afraid to acknowledge the painful chapters in our history. But we also know that the Zionist story, objectively told, is mostly extraordinary, heroic, and inspiring.</p> \n<p>And we know as well that, properly read, this history points us in the direction of true compromise: a just Israel, and a democratic Palestine.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And finally, this: If my questioner belonged to IfNotNow, I would make it clear that I have no problem with IfNotNow demanding honest education about Israel and Palestine. Honesty is the essential element of good education. But I do have a problem with IfNotNow’s refusal to take a position on whether a Jewish state should even exist.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>By failing to recognize the importance of a Jewish state, IfNotNow is refusing to consider the well-being or even the living reality of Israel’s 6.5 million Jews. It is refusing to acknowledge the importance of national sovereignty to an embattled Jewish people, which, after 2000 years, is finally able to control its own destiny.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>So yes, I would say, you are right to be unhappy if no one taught you about the occupation. But education that is good, moral, and Jewish must not only teach about the occupation, but also about what is to replace the occupation.</p> \n<p>And that means not one people ruling another, but two states: A sovereign, independent State of Israel that will rally the Jewish people to her side and strengthen Jews everywhere. And a sovereign, independent State of Palestine that will live in peace alongside Israel, providing justice and security to a Palestinian people long relegated to victimhood by its own leaders and by the nations of the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That is the education we should aspire to provide to our students.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Eric H.

        "text":["<p>In his first act as leader in June 1977, Prime Minister Menachem Begin announced that Israel would take in 66 Vietnamese refugees whose boat had sank near the coast of Vietnam. “The people of Israel, who experienced persecution and who know perhaps more than any other nation the meaning of the word refugee, cannot stand by and witness the suffering of these wretches,” said the first Likud premier.</p> \n<p>Last September, days after conducting a well-publicized tour of south Tel Aviv, Begin’s successor as Likud chief and prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had this to say: “The filth and stench is one thing, but the fact that Sonya, 72, can only come down once a day [from her sixth-floor apartment] with someone accompanying her, going back up with difficulty at the end of the day, is inexplicable. What I heard from residents was their great distress due to the problem of the infiltrators,” he said, using a word right-wing politicians frequently use to describe African asylum seekers. “We have the right to expel everyone who is here illegally,” he added.</p> \n<p>Instead of describing wretches and refugees – with the people of Israel the first to recognize their suffering – the most racist, inflammatory and corrupt person ever to lead this country evoked images from the pages of Nazi tabloid Der St&uuml;rmer: Filth, stench, an elderly lady threatened by an African mob. Other members of his party have defined them as “a cancer in the nation’s body,” as carriers of viral diseases or as dangerous due to their sexual proclivities. This is a Nazi discourse to all intents and purposes, in a country of survivors of the Nazi genocide.</p> \n<p>In 2006, the number of asylum seekers in Israel was estimated at no more than several hundred. Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, who headed a committee examining the situation of refugees and asylum seekers, stated that Israel had a special obligation toward these people. After all, the Jewish people know what it feels like to face locked doors, he said. When the issue of constructing detention centers – like the ones being built in Europe at the time – came up, Rubinstein objected vehemently. That would be a black day for Israel, he said. What was erected in Europe was reminiscent of concentration camps, and we could never allow ourselves to erect such camps.</p> \n<p>As we all know, detention centers were erected here, with thousands of refugees incarcerated in them. Soon, the refugees will be incarcerated in different facilities for an unlimited period. These inmates will have no way out other than declaring their willingness to leave the country and boarding a plane for deportation.</p> \n<p>The Israeli government has embarked on an operation that its creators – Netanyahu and cabinet members Arye Dery and Gilad Erdan – hope will lead to the deportation of some 40,000 African refugees, including 5,000 children who were born here and know no other home.</p> \n<p>This planned deportation is the latest in a long line of historical injustices the Jewish state has perpetrated since 1948. It puts Israel in a place of dishonor alongside states whose history includes genocide, ethnic cleansing, and the deportation of refugees and asylum seekers. But unlike in the past, when mass expulsions took place in situations of war or violent conflicts – which obviously did not grant legitimacy to crimes against humanity – this time the circumstances are different. This time, it’s only the desire to keep the Jewish state forever pure.</p> \n<p>Such thinking, even if its expressions are somewhat hidden, is not new in Zionist or Israeli history. From the beginning, Zionism had to face the question of the existential need to establish a national home with a solid demographic majority for the Jewish people – which had known harsh periods of expulsion and murder – in relation to the liberal, humanist and multinational concept as developed by European liberals at the end of the 19th century. The first Zionist thinkers such as Ahad Ha’am, Theodor Herzl and Ze’ev Jabotinsky were raised on these values.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian residents of the land were the victims of the decision that was made (regardless of whether it was imposed on the leaders of the nascent Jewish state, or whether it was consciously and willingly embraced): To turn the Jewish state into a mono-ethnic and mono-national entity to the extent that international and military conditions would allow.</p> \n<p>There is no disputing the fact that Zionism, as a movement with a strong component of colonial settlement, never really wanted to leave the Palestinian “natives” on their land. These people were an ongoing reminder of the problematic nature of the Jewish claim to territory it considered its historical inheritance. A large Palestinian presence, beyond its security considerations, left open the bigger question of the rightful ownership of this land. Their transfer from here, hopefully voluntarily and as part of an agreement – and if not, by violence and coercion – was a latent goal in Zionist thinking throughout the British Mandate period. This was supported by many Jewish community leaders here at the time. This objective, which was partially achieved during the Nakba of 1948 [the Palestinian term for the formation of Israel], has not changed to this day, even though it’s understood it will be very difficult to implement under current circumstances.</p> \n<p>In many ways, the challenge posed to the Jewish state by 40,000 African refugees is similar to the Palestinian problem. The Africans pose no security risk; they’re not terrorists; and all they ask is to be allowed to stay and make a living, usually in jobs most Israelis won’t do. But if we examine the worldview of the person spearheading the current expulsion campaign, we see that Netanyahu has defined the problem of their remaining here on exactly the same lines. In 2012, he stated that “60,000 infiltrators could become 600,000 and possibly even jeopardize Israel’s continued existence as a Jewish democracy.”</p> \n<p>Clearly, these refugees do not endanger Israel’s democracy. But they do pose a threat to its future as a mono-ethnic Jewish state, according to the harsh Zionist conception Netanyahu embraces. And obviously there will not be 600,000 refugees arriving in Israel. But a danger to the ethnic purity of the state still exists with the presence of even the 40,000 wretched souls who are still here.</p> \n<p>The extent to which the expulsion of African asylum seekers is linked to the extremist, racist and violent worldview in Israel toward anyone who is not part of the “Jewish Volk” can be found in two incidents.</p> \n<p>One night in April 2012, Molotov cocktails were thrown at three apartments housing African asylum seekers and a kindergarten attended by their children. Refugees from Sudan were asleep in the apartments, and it was a miracle no one was burned alive.</p> \n<p>Three years later, in July 2015, a firebomb was thrown into the home of the Dawabsheh family in the West Bank village of Duma. The two parents and their infant son were killed. In the first case, no one was ever arrested. In the second case, an extremist from a nearby settlement was indicted on three counts of murder in January 2016.</p> \n<p>The common denominator in these two horrific acts – other than the fact that they recall the Nazi pogrom in Germany in November 1938 (Kristallnacht) – is not the attempt to burn alive people who the perpetrators believed did not deserve to live. This murderous racism aimed at the “other,” which exists mainly within parts of the national-religious camp in Israeli society, is met with indifference and disinterest by vast portions of the general public. However, the main problem is the backing given by the government to such views, either through actions such as deportation (of Africans), or through a discourse of apartheid and ethnic cleansing (of Palestinians).</p> \n<p>This common denominator does not distinguish between an African child and a Palestinian one. The deportation of refugees and the discourse about ethnic cleansing are part of the same historical development.</p> \n<p>In order to understand the current Israeli racism, we must examine not only its contemporary expressions but its historical ones too. Just as in Europe it is impossible nowadays to separate racism and hostility toward Muslims and racism in its historical forms – anti-Semitism, persecution of the Roma, the annihilation of nations in colonial times – and just as neo-Nazis in the United States view blacks, Muslims and Jews as a common enemy, we cannot separate racism directed at Africans in Israel from the racist attitudes (covert and overt) that have existed here against the Arabs for decades.</p> \n<p>Racism in Europe is part of a historical and cultural legacy. Hostility, suspicion and animosity toward Arabs is part of the historical legacy of Zionism and Jewish society in Israel. The dehumanization of Africans and Arabs among many parts of Israeli society is similar. They are perceived as inferior and guilty of sex crimes and violence in its many manifestations – national, sexual or criminal. Africans are perceived as a danger to the quality of life, while the Palestinians are seen as a security and demographic risk. A final solution to the greater problem is at least unattainable for now, but beginning with the Africans is possible.</p> \n<p>Prof. Daniel Blatman is a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Most Americans haven’t seen the movies nominated for prizes in the numerous year-end awards ceremonies, studies have shown. (Sometimes they haven’t even heard of them.) That’s because blockbusters like “Wonder Woman” or “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” don’t usually secure best movie nominations.</p> \n<p>This year, though, I was in the same boat. I had heard of the 10 nominations in the Golden Globes’ two best movie categories (dramas and musicals/comedies), but only three have so far been released in Israel: “Dunkirk,” “Get Out” and “The Greatest Showman.” Therefore, I can’t judge whether it’s right and good that “Lady Bird,” written and directed by indie actor Greta Gerwig, won in the best musical/comedy category; or whether the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro deserved to win best director for his film “The Shape of Water.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' just won big at the Golden Globes. Here's why you shouldn't binge-watch it</p> \n<p>The reason only three of the 10 candidates had been released in Israel is a function of distribution considerations, but some are on their way. Steven Spielberg’s “The Post,” which won nothing, will open in Israel this weekend. “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” follows the following week, as does Del Toro’s “Shape of Water.” Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me By Your Name,” which also left the ceremony unrewarded, should be arriving soon, likewise James Franco’s “The Disaster Artist” (for which he won best actor in a musical/comedy).</p> \n<p>I did see a preview of “Three Billboards,” which claimed four awards, but will expand on that after it’s been released in Israel.</p> \n<p>Since the Golden Globes are awarded for both cinema and television, there are a lot of prizes to hand out and the ceremony moves briskly from prize to prize. The Golden Globes are supposed to be livelier and freer than the fossilized Oscars, but there are so many prizes that there’s little time to have fun. Two stars, or just one, climb on stage; early on in the proceedings they can mouth some of the usual platitudes before announcing the nominees, but later they just read the list and stand aside as the winner takes the stage. You sometimes feel that if you blink, you missed it.</p> \n<p>Almost all the winners mentioned the sex scandals in Hollywood and many touched on the status of women in the industry, as well as the gender pay gap. Barbra Streisand, who awarded the best director prize to Martin McDonagh for “Three Billboards,” noted that she is the only female director to ever win a Golden Globe – and that was 34 years ago for “Yentl.” Streisand’s call on women to direct stood out all the more given that while Gerwig’s movie won best musical/comedy, she herself was not even nominated for the best director award.</p> \n<p>The ethnic aspect of the Hollywood film industry also came up, peaking in the acknowledgement speech by Oprah Winfrey, who won the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award. Everybody there seemed to catch their breath as Winfrey eloquently spoke out, sounding sometimes like a presidential candidate. She did not mention President Donald Trump, but she did refer to what his administration is up to.</p> \n<p>Host Seth Meyers did mention Trump explicitly, though: “And we’re all here tonight courtesy of the Hollywood Foreign Press. ... A string of three words that could not have been better designed to infuriate our president. ‘Hollywood foreign press.’ The only name that could make him angrier would be the Hillary Mexico Salad Association.”</p> \n<p>Another high point was when Kirk Douglas, 101, took to the stage in a wheelchair, together with his daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones, to hand out an award. As always in such cases, there was something both moving and embarrassing about the incident – especially when Douglas tried to say a few words that proved incomprehensible. Zeta-Jones didn’t appear to understand them either, or maybe she chose not to share them with the audience and moved onto reading the list of nominees.</p> \n<p>Gary Oldman won best actor for his performance as Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour,” which is currently playing in Israel. In his acceptance speech, Oldman forgot to thank his director, Joe Wright, to whom he apologized afterward. Still he may be able to right that wrong at the Academy Awards ceremony on March 4.</p> \n<p>The winner in the best foreign film category was “In the Fade,” by the Turkish-German director Fatih Akin. Being a fan of his oeuvre, which includes “Head-On” and “The Edge of Heaven,” I hope “Fade” comes fast. And as for Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, she presented the ceremony’s first award and, from time to time, the camera rested on her as she sat in the audience.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As 2017 drew to a close, there was a sense in some quarters that the BDS movement to boycott, sanction, and divest from Israel had fallen on hard times.</p> \n<p>&quot;Dear Jewish community, So you wanna understand Israel-Palestine debates on campus?&quot; wrote New Voices Editor Sara Weissman in a July Jewish Journal piece&nbsp;about the North American university experience. &quot;The first thing you have to do is stop talking about BDS. Shocking, right? We try.</p> \n<p>&quot;But really,&quot; Weissman continued, &quot;the Boycott, Sanctions and Divestment campaign against Israel isn’t what Israel conversations on campus are all about these days. Campaigns to pass BDS measures on major campuses are actually in decline, yet somehow they still make up the bulk of Jewish news about students.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the same time, the most closely monitored index of the movement's clout, the artistic boycott which seeks to persuade singers and bands to refuse to appear in Israel, seemed to have lost all momentum. One headline in Haaretz&nbsp;read: &quot;Performers Are Flooding Israel: A Sign of the Cultural Boycott's Failure?&quot;</p> \n<p>And then, last month, something changed that. In two words: Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>&quot;Up until a month ago, an intense love affair was underway between the greatest performers in the world and Israeli concert promoters,&quot; wrote Raz Shechnik in the weekend Yedioth Ahronoth. &quot;The future of the market was colored in the soft shades of a pink lord (Israeli slang for a permanent marker pen, and a play on the name of New Zealand singing star Lorde).</p> \n<p>&quot;Just then, came U.S. President Donald Trump's declaration recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>And, as Shechnik notes, a floodtide of subsequent events - including Lorde's sudden cancellation of plans to appear in Israel, eruption of rioting in Palestinian areas, and the Likud Central Committee's unanimous decision to push for full annexation of the bulk of the West Bank – caused an abrupt, 180-degree shift in major Israeli concert promoters' predictions for the new year:</p> \n<p>&quot;The market has gone from gearing up for an excellent summer of 2018, the kind that would have even stolen the limelight from the last summer of concerts, to a state of despondency, and to forecasts conveying, at best, uncertainty, and at worst, pessimism.&quot;</p> \n<p>On Friday, as promoters fretted over performers who have yet to decide whether to appear in Israel this year, more than 100 artists including musicians, writers, actors and directors signed an open letter&nbsp;published in The Guardian in support of Lorde’s right to cancel – among them actor Mark Ruffalo, singer Peter Gabriel, former Pink Floyd front man Roger Waters, actor John Cusack, British director Ken Loach, writer Angela Davis and writer Alice Walker.</p> \n<p>The open letter also slammed a full-page Washington Post newspaper ad condemning Lorde for being a &quot;bigot&quot; – an advertisement placed by Rabbi Shmuely Boteach, whose circle of support links Trump, Netanyahu, and mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.</p> \n<p>Just like that, the thought occurs: Donald Trump could be the best thing that ever happened to BDS.</p> \n<p>Why? To begin with, there is the effect he has had - and continues to have - on the Netanyahu government as a whole, and on Benjamin Netanyahu in particular.</p> \n<p>How does it work?</p> \n<p>Freed by Trump: Day by day, Netanyahu and his coalition lurch further and further to the right. As they do, the contentions of BDS activists are brought closer and closer to a simple recognition of reality.</p> \n<p>Buoyed by Trump: Thankful for his declarations marginalizing Palestinians and rendering peace talks impossible, Netanyahu moves to make Israel into a one state reality, even as Israeli officials get ready to waste an additional $72 million dollars&nbsp;– critically needed for Israel's own social ills – on accusing BDS activists of seeking a one-state reality.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Emulating Trump: Netanyahu moves to make Israel a repressive, racist theocracy, enacting travel bans, cementing in place an Israel off-limits to tourists on the basis of their politics, obscenely callous to Jewish converts of color, proud of plans to deport or imprison tens of thousands of Sudanese and Eritrean asylum seekers whose only crime, children and the elderly included, is seeking asylum.</p> \n<p>Day by day, we, as this Israel, pledge allegiance, then, to the settlements and the dictatorship for which it stands, One State, under an Orthodox Jewish God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all settlers and their Jewish fellow travelers. And only.</p> \n<p>How bad is it?</p> \n<p>This week, Birthright co-founder Charles Bronfman titled his cautionary opinion piece for the Forward, &quot;Abandoning the Two-State Solution Means Abandoning the Jewish Soul.&quot;</p> \n<p>Inspired by Trump: the Netanyahu government seeks new ways to deregulate settlements, retroactively legalizing outposts which even Israel considers illegal, and effectively annexing West Bank territory by declaring that Israel has permanent, non-negotiable territorial claims to the whole of the West Bank and East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Emboldened by Trump, Netanyahu has made clear that there is no need whatsoever to extend basic human rights to the millions of Palestinians resident there.</p> \n<p>Nor to allow into Israel members of a long list of leftist groups, among them the American Friends Service Committee, a human rights group which aided and rescued victims of the Nazis.</p> \n<p>The bottom line, though, may be this: Every time that Netanyahu defers to Trump, aligns with Trump, kisses up to Trump, BDS wins.</p> \n<p>Every time Israel acts to reduce critical humanitarian aid to the Palestinians along with Trump, BDS wins.</p> \n<p>In all, every time that Israel is identified with Trump the hated, the pathetic, the abominable, the bigoted, the crude, the suspect, the deceitful, the shunned – BDS wins.</p> \n<p>&quot;If anyone thought that Trump's [Jerusalem] declaration would improve Israel's standing in the world entertainment market, in practice the opposite is the case,&quot; Shechnik wrote.</p> \n<p>It's still too soon to know if Lorde's cancellation will have downstream effects, but promoters have noted that big-name artists have been waiting to sign contracts for shows in Israel.</p> \n<p>Gad Oron, promoter of appearances by the likes of Bob Dylan, Metallica, and Guns 'n' Roses, told Yedioth, &quot;Lorde's cancellation caused us harm, and it's clearly the beginning of something that could cause a domino effect.&quot;</p> \n<p>Her decision against appearing in Israel, Oron said, &quot;received widespread coverage in the world, and that has put ideas into the heads of artists and managers who had not even thought about this. They hear that Lorde's cancelled, and they begin to check out why that happened, and what the deal is with the UN and Trump, and what's happening in the territories.&quot; &nbsp;</p>",

The events are traditionally seen as a moment when political differences are set aside to celebrate common democratic values.</p> \n<p>The marches still feature veterans from the National Association of Italian Partisans, representing the Italian armed resistance groups that fought the fascists during World War II.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Lazio's Anne Frank 'Insult' Is Hardly Shocking.

It Should Be Republished | Opinion ■&nbsp;Following Assault, Top German Jewish Leader Urges Community: Don't Wear Kippas &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>This year’s Liberation Day has even greater significance in Italy, since the country is marking 80 years since the introduction of the Racial Laws that mainly targeted the country’s Jewish minority.</p> \n<p>Palestinian flags started to appear on marches in the 1970s, under the pretext that they were representative of the greater struggle against repression. Indeed, it is common to see symbols and flags seemingly unrelated to Italy’s liberation during the marches, with demonstrators insisting they have to connect the Italian experience with fascism to other national struggles against oppression today.</p> \n<p>For decades, Italian Jews joined Liberation Day celebrations without feeling the need to march under separate banners or slogans, or to differentiate themselves from other Italians.</p> \n<p>However, soon after the Palestinian flags started appearing, members of Italy’s Jewish communities started to march carrying flags of the Jewish Brigade (aka Jewish Infantry Brigade Group). Its flag, a star of David between two blue vertical stripes, is similar to the Israeli flag.</p> \n<p>The unit, part of the British Army, featured Jews from British Mandatory Palestine who fought alongside the British in the war. In Italy, some 5,000 Jewish Brigade soldiers fought the Nazis between March-April 1945, with 41 killed. And, of course, many of the Jewish combatants who fought fascism in Europe later fought in the Israeli War of Independence.</p> \n<p>Encounters between Palestinian organizations and groups carrying symbols of the Jewish Brigade – often alongside Israeli flags – soon created an underlying tension on Liberation Day marches. In recent years, these tensions erupted into direct confrontations where supporters of the Palestinian struggle attacked representatives of the Jewish Brigade, calling them “fascists,” “murderers of children” and arguing that they should not be allowed to take part in the march.</p> \n<p>Likewise, those demonstrating to remember the role played by the Jewish Brigade accused pro-Palestinian groups of hijacking the real significance of the day, while also labeling them “Nazis” and recalling how Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini enjoyed good relations with Hitler. Four years ago, the confrontations degenerated in violent clashes that left members on both sides injured.</p> \n<p>Ahead of last year’s Liberation Day, Rome’s Jewish community said it intended to hold its own march to remember the Jewish Brigade, snubbing the main march that for decades had brought together all sides of the political divide.</p> \n<p>This move exacerbated tensions with the partisans’ association, which was accused of not doing enough to accommodate the Jewish groups looking to honor the Jewish Brigade.</p> \n<p>The announcement of a separate march caused consternation in Italy, since the Jewish community has always been seen as a crucial part of official events to mark the country’s liberation from fascism.</p> \n<p>For several months ahead of this year’s holiday, Italian authorities – including Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi and the partisans’ association – sought to find common ground and hold a joint march on Liberation Day.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, a statement signed by the association, Raggi and the president of the Jewish community, Ruth Dureghello, announced that a compromise had been reached.</p> \n<p>“Given the re-emergence across Europe and in our country, Italy, of new and old forms of fascism, given the ubiquitous presence of racism and violence in political discourse, there is a need to be responsible and overcome the differences which, in the last few years, have characterized liberation celebrations,” the statement read.</p> \n<p>The march “must concentrate on the history of the resistance, the struggle against fascism and its protagonists,” the statement added, offering an implicit warning against bringing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the streets of Rome.</p> \n<p>But just as everything seemed settled and as the media hailed this year’s “inclusive march,” Palestinian activists in Rome said they would still be marching with kaffiyehs and Palestinian flags. “We call on all anti-imperialists, anti-fascists, anti-racists and anti-Zionists to come to the streets,” a statement said.</p> \n<p>Stunned by that statement, Jewish community representatives said they expected the partisans’ association to take a stance against the pro-Palestinian groups that, they said, were once again trying to hijack the celebrations.</p> \n<p>However, since the association did not respond to the Palestinian statement, Jewish community representatives said they will boycott Wednesday’s march.</p> \n<p>“The National Association of Italian Partisans failed to take an official and definitive position against the participation of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian organizations that carry symbols alien to the spirit of” Liberation Day, the community said in a statement. “It is unacceptable and inconsistent with history to maintain an attitude of impartiality between symbols of those who fought with the Nazis and those of the Jewish Brigade,” it added.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in Milan, where representatives of the Jewish Brigade marched in the official event last year, unlike in Rome, after the local partisans’ association guaranteed their safety, pro-Palestinian groups said they would meet in the central Piazza San Babila to “protest the Zionist presence in the march” on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The highlight of this year’s celebrations in Milan was supposed to be a video message by Liliana Segre, an Italian Holocaust survivor who was made a senator-for-life by President Sergio Mattarella in January. However, that looks like being overshadowed by yet another round of Jewish-Palestinian clashes.</p>",

Below are some items for Passover — reading material to escape the daily news crush&nbsp;or, at the very least, to get you through the seder. Thank you to the volunteer JI-ers who helped us put this special edition together.&nbsp;  News cycle permitting, the Daily Kickoff will be on break until after Passover. In the meantime, if you’re experiencing any withdrawal, follow us on Twitter.  Pesach/Passover means different things to different people. So, whether you’re thinking about  ...a great story of hope   Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks:&nbsp;“Pesach is the oldest and most transformative story of hope ever told. It tells of how an otherwise undistinguished group of slaves found their way to freedom from the greatest and longest-lived empire of their time, indeed of any time. It tells the revolutionary story of how the supreme Power intervened in history to liberate the supremely powerless. It is a story of the defeat of probability by force of possibility. It defines what it is to be a Jew: a living symbol of hope.” [KorenPublishers]  ...or remembering the Exodus from Egypt.   Rabbi Sharon Brous:&nbsp;“Passover is the centerpiece of the Jewish moral imagination and the Jewish collective memory, and so every aspect of Jewish liturgy, of the calendar, of the Jewish experience in the world is in some way rooted in the experience of the Yetziat Mitzrayim, of the Exodus from Egypt.” [PBS] &nbsp; ...in LongForm &nbsp; FOR YOUR LAST MINUTE HAGGADAH PRINTING NEEDS --&nbsp;“15 are the Haggadah commentaries... 8 are the English translations of the Haggadah. 2 are the versions of the Hebrew Haggadah (Ashkenazi and Edot haMizrach).... 1 is God (in Heaven and Earth)... and it's also the one website where all this information lives, for free and for everyone.” [Sefaria] &nbsp; ...or Longer-Form...  Jonathan Safran Foer:&nbsp;“In the absence of a stable homeland, Jews have made their home in books, and the Haggadah — whose core is the retelling of the Exodus from Egypt — has been translated more widely, and revised more often, than any other Jewish book. Everywhere Jews have wandered, there have been Haggadot — from the 14th-century Sarajevo Haggadah (which is said to have survived World War II under the floorboards of a mosque, and the siege of Sarajevo in a bank vault), to those made by Ethiopian Jews airlifted to Israel during Operation Moses.&quot; [NYTimes]  &quot;The Book of Exodus: A double rescue in wartime Sarajevo&quot; by&nbsp;Geraldine Brooks:&nbsp;&quot;Servet [Korkut] remembers very clearly the day her husband came home for lunch with the Haggadah still under his jacket. “I knew he had&nbsp;a book from the library, and that it was very important,” she recalled. “He said, ‘Take care, don’t tell. No one must know or they’ll kill us and destroy the book.’ ” Over the midday meal, he pondered what to do with the Haggadah. That afternoon, he drove out of the city, to Visoko, where one of his sisters lived, on the pretext of visiting her. From there, he took the book to a remote village on nearby Trescavica, where his friend was&nbsp;hodza, or imam, of the small local mosque. There, Servet said, the Haggadah was hidden among Korans and other Islamic texts for the duration of the war. When it was safe, “the&nbsp;hodza&nbsp;brought it back to us, and Dervis returned it to the museum,” she said.&quot; [NewYorker]&nbsp;  ...or 280 characters  JI-er&nbsp;Noam Neusner posts&nbsp;“If you're on Twitter and you're interested in learning more about Passover (which starts on Friday night), this week my dad is posthumously tweeting a ton of insights about Passover and its meaning...His tweets come from his books -- I just load up the words on Hootsuite.” [Twitter]  .or intellectual fare.   Civil War Seder:&nbsp;“In the midst of the bloodiest conflict in American history, after a long winter in West Virginia backcountry, this plucky group of Jews improvised a unique version of an ancient tradition, cobbling together the tastes and symbols of Passover under truly unusual circumstances.” [JewishReviewOfBooks]  ...or simply what's on the menu  Put Some Spring in Your Passover Seder with the Jewish Food Society’s Naama Shefi --&nbsp;“Passover begins at the end of this week, and as is the case with most holidays, old traditions come to mind. In the case of the Seder dinner, you've got your brisket, your charoset, your matzo ball soup. &quot;I think about tradition too, for sure,&quot; Naama Shefi, the founder of the Jewish Food Society, told WNYC. &quot;But then I really think about spring. Growing up in Israel, for me, Passover equals spring. I think about the first artichokes of the season, and fava beans, and peas. That's my starting point.&quot; And when it comes to &quot;traditional&quot; food among the Jewish diaspora, there's no one single source. &quot;It's important to remember that the Jewish people lived for thousands of years all around the world,&quot; Shefi said, &quot;They created their own cuisines that were the result of a constant negotiation between the local food traditions, their kashrut rules, and special foods for the holiday.&quot; For this year's Seder, Shefi's table will feature Turkish stuffed onions and tomatoes, steamed artichokes with lemon, chopped liver, and a matzo ball soup with a Mexican twist.” [WNYC]  we wish you a happy and healthy Passover -- Chag Kasher V’Sameach!  And now&nbsp;the news...&nbsp;  TRUMP TUMULT --&nbsp;“Trump ousts Veterans Affairs chief Shulkin, nominates personal physician to replace him” by Emily Wax-Thibodeaux, Josh Dawsey and Lisa Rein:&nbsp;“President Trump on Wednesday ousted Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin after turmoil in the agency’s senior ranks generated weeks of unflattering headlines The president announced the move on Twitter [John] Kelly called Shulkin Wednesday afternoon and told him he was losing his job, a White House official said. “It was just a courtesy. Thanks for your service,” this person said, describing the call Shulkin’s biggest weakness [Phillip] Carter said, was that he didn’t connect with the president’s allies. “That was always festering beneath the surface — he was an Obama holdover,” Carter said.” [WashPost]&nbsp;&nbsp;  -- Shulkin writes in the New York Times...&nbsp;&quot;As many of you know, I am a physician, not a politician. I came to government with an understanding that Washington can be ugly, but I assumed that I could avoid all of the ugliness by staying true to my values. I have been falsely accused of things by people who wanted me out of the way. But despite these politically-based attacks on me and my family’s character, I am proud of my record and know that I acted with the utmost integrity. Unfortunately, none of that mattered. As I prepare to leave government, I am struck by a recurring thought: It should not be this hard to serve your country.&quot; [NYTimes]  TOP TALKER -- “Shake-Up Remakes Kushner’s Role” by Peter Nicholas and Felicia Schwartz:&nbsp;&quot;The&nbsp;nomination of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state&nbsp;and the appointment of&nbsp;John Bolton as national security adviser&nbsp;could also curb Mr. Kushner’s sway if foreign diplomats, who have been courting the president’s son-in-law as an alternative to Mr. Tillerson, turn more to the traditional U.S. diplomatic machinery... In talking with friends, Mr. Kushner has joked about the Middle East views of Mr. Bolton... The “Orthodox Jews” working toward a Middle East peace deal... are now looking like “the moderates,” Mr. Kushner has told people.&quot;  &quot;Coming off the latest White House shake-up, Mr. Kushner is engaging in diplomacy of a more personal sort as he and Messrs. Bolton and Pompeo carve out their respective roles...&nbsp;Mr. Kushner has made clear he wants to work collaboratively with Mr. Pompeo...&nbsp;Mr. Kushner has a longer history with Mr. Bolton, having dealt with the incoming national security adviser during the campaign. When Mr. Bolton visited the White House, he often stopped in to see Mr. Kushner. Over the past year, Mr. Kushner has called Mr. Bolton for advice, including about the operations of the United Nations.&quot; [WSJ]&nbsp;  REGIME CHANGE OR MAYBE SAUDI-LED&nbsp;DEAL?&nbsp;-- “U.S. ambassador to Israel: If Abbas won't negotiate, someone else will” by Barak Ravid: “David Friedman made his comments in an interview with a newspaper called &quot;Shviee&quot; which is distributed in synagogues in Israel &quot;Time doesn’t stand stilland if he is not interested is negotiating – I am sure somebody else will. Vacuums tend to be filled. If [Mahmoud Abbas] creates a vacuum I am sure somebody will fill it. And we will move forward (on the peace process). The U.S. wants to help the Palestinian people – if the leadership is not on the same page then so be it, but we will not abandon the desire to improve the life of Palestinians.&quot;  “In the interview Friedman spoke about Abbas's latest speech, in which he called the U.S. ambassador a &quot;son of a dog.&quot; Friedman said he was not insulted personally by the derogatory remark. He added: &quot;He did a disservice to his peoplethose types of comments are very undiplomatic and make it more difficult for the U.S. to have serious conversations about serious issues. Calling me names is not going to improve the situation of the Palestinians.”” [Axios]&nbsp;  Former Ambassador Martin Indyk tweets:&nbsp;“So now it’s regime change time in Palestine?

Worth noting: Saudi Crown Prince MBS had been staying in the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;  LOOMING -- “Israel warns it may use lethal fire on Gaza border protests” by Laurent Lozano and Adel Zaanoun:&nbsp;“Israel has warned that its soldiers could use live fire if Gaza Palestinians try to breach the border with Israel during a mass rally planned for Friday It is expected to kick off more than six weeks of protests throughout the Palestinian territories leading up to the inauguration of the new US embassy in Jerusalem around May 14. Israeli armed forces chief Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot said reinforcements, including more than 100 special forces snipers, had been deployed to the border and the army was prepared for all scenarios &quot;The instructions are to use a lot of force,&quot; he said.” [AFP]&nbsp;  PROFILE --&nbsp;&quot;'Tibi, Not Bibi': The Palestinian Who Stood up to Pence on Why He Could Be the Region's Next Leader&quot; by Jack Moore: &quot;As the election of President Donald Trump and the policies of a right-wing Israeli coalition government render a two-state solution more distant than ever, Ahmad Tibi believes the region's next leader could an Arab lawmaker. In one word, him. “Tibi will be the prime minister, not Bibi. From the sea to the river, we are more. It’s a nightmare for the Israelis,&quot; he said... In a one-state solution, the deputy speaker of the Knesset is confident that he would win enough votes&nbsp;if that state&nbsp;held&nbsp;equal rights for Arabs and Jews, and a one-person, one-vote system. But Israel will prevent this&nbsp;outcome,&nbsp;he predicted...&nbsp;“I really support the vision of a two-state solution. But both Netanyahu and Trump killed it,” he said.&quot; [Newsweek]  TURTLE BAY -- Germany denies deal to give Israel UN council seat:&nbsp;“Pro-Israel activists in the United States have accused Berlin of not honoring an agreement struck almost 20 years ago to let Israel run uncontested for one of the non-permanent seats reserved for the [WEOG] regional group, but Germany denies that such a pledge was made. &quot;It's always been the case in the past that there are different candidacies,&quot; German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told journalists in New York &quot;We do not run against anyone. We are running for a seat at the Security Council.&quot; Israel, Germany and Belgium are vying for the two seats reserved for the regional group... on June 8.” [YahooNews]&nbsp;  IRAN DEAL TALKS --&nbsp;“European powers press for Iran sanctions to buttress nuclear deal” by Robin Emmott and John Irish:&nbsp;“The new measures proposed by London, Paris and Berlin were discussed by the EU’s 28 ambassadors and could include members of Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)... In Brussels at the closed-door meeting, the three pushed for agreement on possible travel bans and asset freezes before a foreign ministers’ meeting next month Diplomats pointed to the next EU foreign ministers’ meeting in Luxembourg on April 16, the last formal gathering on the EU agenda before Trump’s May deadline But another diplomat said: “It will be complicated because this will need time to convince the member states.”” [Reuters]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon at a United Nations Security Council meeting on peacekeeping:&nbsp;“To the permanent members of this Council I have a simple message: do not miss this opportunity. In 45 days the clock will run out and the rules of the game will change. You now have a choice to make. Either choose to work with the Americans and support their genuine efforts to make the Middle East a safer place — or choose Iran and enable a dangerous regime. I urge you to make the right choice.”  &quot;Does Israel need France more than France needs Israel?&quot; by Rina Bassist:&nbsp;&quot;Netanyahu is heavily invested in Trump, but this does not mean that he will neglect the rest of the world, especially Europe. He knows that if there is one European leader that Trump likes, it's French President Emmanuel Macron. He also knows that if Trump’s Middle East peace plan fails, the European Union is likely to step in... European foreign policy is being championed and shaped by the pro-EU Macron, especially on the Iranian file. Both Jerusalem and Washington share this assessment of Macron, although he has so far failed to change Trump’s mind on Iran.&quot;  &quot;Given this, the cross-cultural Israel-France Season might offer Netanyahu a golden opportunity.&nbsp;He has already confirmed his attendance at one of the main events at the Grand Palais in Paris in June. Associates of the prime minister say that the international timetable works in his favor. If indeed Trump nixes the Iran deal in May, then Netanyahu will arrive in Paris as a winner...&nbsp;For the moment, Netanyahu is trying to channel dialogue toward what unites Israel and Europe, instead of what divides them.&quot; [Al-Monitor]&nbsp;  STATESIDE -- New law lets Mississippi invest in bonds issued by Israel:&nbsp;“A new Mississippi law will allow the state treasury to invest up to $20 million in bonds issued by Israel. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant, who has traveled to Israel several times, signed Senate Bill 2051 Tuesday. The law takes effect July 1.

In response to a question from Wharton management professor Mae McDonnell on whether Butterfield ever worries that private Slack chat “channels” can reinforce exclusion, CEO also joked, “I worry about everything. I have a Jewish grandmother.”&nbsp;[Quartz]&nbsp;  Mayim Bialik writes&nbsp;“Confronting politics and finding meaning on my trip to Israel: I spoke at the 6th Global Forum on Anti-Semitism in Jerusalem last week. I was invited by the Consul General of Los Angeles, Sam Grundwerg I was asked to meet with President Trump’s Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and I was nervous about it since I do not understand many of his positions. I politely gave him a piece of my liberal mind about his boss, suggesting that the President would have fewer problems with the “liberal media” if he would simply stop tweeting insults to actors and countries with nuclear weapons capabilities. Even though Friedman stood by his political leanings and I stood by mine, it was a respectful, if colorful, conversation. Politics is indeed part of the problem, but I decided to find a way to speak about my experience with anti-Semitism without making it about who I voted for. And I am glad I did: leaving politics aside – I hoped – we could all focus on where we are united” [GrokNation]&nbsp;  ACROSS THE POND -- Jeremy Corbyn admits hundreds of anti-Semitism cases referred in Labour since 2015:&nbsp;&quot;In an interview&nbsp;with the Jewish News, Mr. Corbyn said action was being taken to crack down on the issue, adding that 150 people have been expelled or have resigned from the party. There are 74 cases still pending, which Mr. Corbyn said must be dealt with &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; ...&nbsp;Mr. Corbyn has insisted anti-Semitism will be the &quot;first priority&quot; of the Labour's new General Secretary, adding that a legal team would be appointed to ensure there is a &quot;proper approach&quot;. &quot;Any abuse that's done is certainly not in my name,&quot; he said.&quot; [SkyNews]  Bret Stephens writes... &quot;Jeremy Corbyn, Accidental Anti-Semite:&nbsp;Corbyn is now urgently seeking meetings with Jewish leaders while saying he is “sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused.” Note the passive voice. Meanwhile, anti-Semitic incidents in Britain&nbsp;hit a record high last year. Corbyn’s rise may not be the cause of it, but it’s unmistakably a symptom. Countries that care about the safety of Jews don’t elevate leaders who have spent their careers being dismissive of it.&quot; [NYTimes]  HOLLYWOOD -- “Harvey Keitel to Star in Pavel Lungin’s ‘Esau,’ Modern Retelling of Biblical Story” by Debra Kamin:&nbsp;“Harvey Keitel, Lior Ashkenazi (“Foxtrot”) and Mark Ivanir (“Homeland”) will headline “Esau,” the first English-language film from acclaimed Russian-French director Pavel Lungin. “Esau,” which is being adapted from the novel of the same name by Israeli author Meir Shalev, follows a 40-year-old writer who returns to his family home after half a lifetime to face the brother who stole both his love and livelihood.

To celebrate the four-cup tradition, I find myself choosing good wines which are more easily semi-gulped, and then for the meal itself, I reward myself and my family with four exceptional bottles to celebrate our being freed from slavery. The four bottles used in obligatory rite are, of course, themselves wonderful wines. Their cost, though, are slight easier to absorb than the dinner cups. The four freedom-cups enhance the latter half of the Seder, which, by cup six, glides by.  First dinner cup:&nbsp;Hevron Heights Armageddon. This wine is a blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 5% Syrah. This wine is aged 24 months in French oak barrels and one can taste blackberry skins and jam-y currents.

        "text":["<p>The video of 18-year-old Palestinian Abed el-Fatah Abed e-Nabi being shot in the back by Israeli soldiers as he runs away from the border fence with Israel back towards Gaza&nbsp;is only one reason to suspect that the use of force employed on the border Friday – which led to the death of 15 Palestinians and the wounding of hundreds more – was unjustified.</p> \n<p>Even the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson’s statements, according to which key agitators were shot, testify to the fact that there is some concern that gunfire was initiated not only when there was a specific and concrete danger from Palestinians, but was also aimed at specific individuals.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; With riots and live fire, Gaza just went 25 years back in time | Analysis &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>In an analysis published by The Israel Democracy Institute, the three legal experts – Prof. Yuval Shany, Prof. Amichai Cohen and Dr. Eliav Lieblich – warned that the means given to a state to defend its borders are not without restrictions. Live fire against civilians, they caution, is only permissible if and when civilians directly participate in hostilities.</p> \n<p>An attempt to cross the border – in this case between Gaza and Israel – does not constitute direct participation in hostilities. Shany, Cohen and Lieblich claim, therefore, that Israel should use only law enforcement measures against those attempting to cross the border, like those measures used to disperse an illegal protest or riot. Those who cross the border can be arrested, but live fire should not be used – except in instances in which there is a specific and concrete threat to life posed by a specific individual. Approaching the border, crossing it and even “incitement” do not justify using live rounds if there is no specific danger to life.</p> \n<p>The images from Gaza, much like the army’s statements, call into serious question whether these rules were respected. An order to open fire at civilians who do not pose a real threat to life is a blatantly illegal order, which has what the Israeli courts call a “black flag” flying over it.</p> \n<p>But one additional perspective should be added to this analysis. Many, including those who are critical of the Israeli army’s conduct on the border and condemn the killing of civilians, accept and stress that Israel has the right to defend its borders. Surprisingly, when the case is Gazans approaching the border, everyone suddenly sanctifies this border and the sovereign state’s right to defend it.</p> \n<p>However, it is worth noting that Israel does not really respect this “border” between itself and the Palestinian territory. Israel continues, even after the 2005 disengagement from Gaza, to hold absolute control of Gaza’s airspace and territorial waters and, in many respects, to control numerous aspect of life within the Strip.</p> \n<p>Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza for many years, in which it has decided who and what can go into Gaza and come out of the Strip. Israel invades Gaza whenever it desires.</p> \n<p>While Gaza is no longer home to settlers, in the West Bank Israel erects cities and communities where hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens live. Israel has never respected borders or “sovereignty.”</p> \n<p>But suddenly, when Palestinians go near the border, the mere act of approaching it is considered a horrendous threat. Suddenly, the fence between Gaza and Israel is the border of a sovereign state that needs to be respected.</p> \n<p>What we can learn from recent days is that Israel, once again, is showing disregard for the lives of Palestinians and uses excessive and unjustified force towards them.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Israel continues to maintain a one-sided border between itself and the Palestinian territories. A border it can breach as it pleases, whether it is to establish settlements&nbsp;or to continue to maintain different forms of control.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the border with Gaza is a hermetically sealed one, blocked by Israel. A Palestinian from Gaza who wants to go to the West Bank to visit family, receive medical care or for any other reason – is beholden to Israel’s goodwill. A Palestinian from Gaza who approaches the border, the one Israel breaches whenever it wants to, can find himself shot to death by the IDF.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“A Quiet Place” is far from being a silent movie, but it has almost no dialogue. The horror science fiction film depicts a near-future in which making any sound, no matter how quiet, draws an immediate, violent and cruel death sentence meted out by mysterious creatures. The actor-screenwriter-producer John Krasinski sought to tell a story about a family that must remain trapped in order to survive. The silence is a gimmick, but it’s a gimmick that works well.</p> \n<p>Something interesting, albeit hard to define, has happened to horror movies recently. In the past year alone, “It” set a box-office record by becoming the most profitable film in the history of the genre, earning $700 million. “Get Out,” written and directed by Jordan Peele, raised the genre’s prestige by winning the Academy Award for best original screenplay. More important, it seems that more and more interesting filmmakers are willing to try instilling fear, and audiences are increasingly willing to be scared. Against the backdrop of the rise in the status of the horror movie, “A Quiet Place” is itself a symbol of this pivot.</p> \n<p>Krasinski, known for playing Jim in the American version of “The Office,” took on the roles of writer, director and lead male character just a year ago. He had directed two forgettable movies (“Brief Interviews with Hideous Men” and “The Hollars”), yet maintained his stature as a Hollywood actor and producer. Until a few years ago, the very choice of a horror film for his third movie would have been considered admitting failure, but the genre is undergoing an evolution. Only a year ago, Peele was a comic in a successful yet minor television series, and now he is a respected director. While he turned to horror for his first movie out of love for the genre, Krasinski got there almost by chance. Bryan Woods and Scott Beck wrote the original story. Krasinski joined them as a screenwriter whose main interest was family dramas, in fact. He has admitted to interviewers that horror is not his cup of tea, but he wanted to explore a family in extremis. To do this he cast his wife, the actress Emily Blunt, to star alongside him. All this enabled him to make a movie in which the horror serves the family drama, rather than the opposite.</p> \n<p>With no explanation, we meet the Abbott family in a postapocalyptic near future, around 2020. Swift, mysterious creatures lurk everywhere, seemingly using echolocation to hunt their human prey. The Abbotts learn to move quietly and barefooted, roaming abandoned parts of upstate New York. Having learned that a cough or a noisy misstep can lead to a quick and violent death within seconds, they move about in hushed, ever-anxious silence. The opening scene makes it abundantly clear just how cruel this world is, in which no one is safe.</p> \n<p>A challenge to the actors</p> \n<p>Because very little is explained, we have to infer that the Abbotts survived thanks to their deaf teenage daughter/sister (Millicent Simmonds). Her parents and her two brothers also learned sign language, so they were prepared for the age of silence when it came. Most of the little dialogue there is in the movie is in hand movements, limiting the communication among the four. The family retreats to a farm after Blunt's character becomes pregnant, and they have an almost-normal life there. Raising a rebellious teen and calming an anxious child (Noah Jupe, “Wonder”) are difficult for any family. For the Abbotts, apparently, it’s a recipe for disaster.</p> \n<p>“A Quiet Place” presents a genuine challenge to the actors, with its paucity of words, but also a genuine opportunity for them to demonstrate their nonverbal communication skills. Sign language moves the tale forward, but it is only part of the conceit. Eyes are the major instrument of expression, mostly used wisely. The chemistry between the couple is clear, but the director-screenwriter was smart enough to recognize who steals the show. Blunt stands out, and also turns in one of her best performances to date. It is interesting to think of her character in the film — a tough mother in a world of monsters&nbsp;— as another layer in her acting repertoire, a moment before she risked being typecast as a different kind of mother. Blunt will play Mary Poppins in the sequel to the 1964 movie, which has late-December release dates in Britain and the United States.</p> \n<p>It’s tempting to call “A Quiet Place” a silent film, but it is something else. Krasinski may be using music and effects to intensify the tension and drama, but he also gives silence the respect it deserves. The silence is natural, not artificial. Breaths, steps, streaming water and cockroaches fill the void. In this imposed silence, as in a movie theater, people are tempted to whisper even when it’s forbidden. The quiet is quite deafening, and it’s done well. In contrast, the world that Krasinski created is a bit confused and filled with contradictions. It doesn’t dwell on answers to questions that arise from viewing it and leaves too many issues unresolved. At the same time, it lingers too long on newspaper clippings and tired explanations to inefficiently provide the little he wants to explain.</p> \n<p>Like “Get Out,” in which the role of horror is secondary to the main concern, that of race in the United States, “A Quiet Place” is not a routine horror movie. The attempt to surprise and shock exists, but it’s not the focus. The film feeds deeper fears, in particular parents’ constant fear for their children’s welfare, and in effect the entire nuclear family is put to the test as a unit founded on cooperation. It touches every possible emotional angle, from a mother struggling to comfort her son without words and a father’s inability to protect his daughter. The family lost its voice just when it needed it the most, and it must create new rules of conduct for itself.</p> \n<p>The comparison to “Get Out” is fair, in light of the attempt to offer more-intelligent horror. While Peele’s movie addressed the fears of a black minority in white society, “A Quiet Place” offers a similar experience for anxious parents in the 21st century. In the past, children went out without a phone, and their parents could only hope that they would return on time, if at all. Today, ignorance is a privilege parents with WhatsApp no longer have. The moment that it’s possible to maintain constant phone contact, every parent is happy to do so — paradoxically, it only preserves the anxiety. The American village in “A Quiet Place,” with its green cornfields, symbolizes the attempt to return to an obsolete American ideal of simplicity and family values. However, it is no longer possible. There is no going back. A heavy punishment is meted out to all those who fail to raise perfect children. Parents who take their eyes off their children for a moment risk devastation. It’s a form of hyperarousal that doesn’t stop during sleep, an anxiety with which many parents can identify.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The outrage and hurt among the African-American community following controversial remarks by Kanye West on Tuesday regarding the role of blacks in their own enslavement rang disturbingly familiar for many Jews, who are used to hearing similar assertions about the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In his live interview with TMZ, in the midst of a rather convoluted ramble explaining his escape from “mental imprisonment,” the rap star stated that in some way slavery was a “choice” for those brought to America from Africa and treated brutally as chattel for hundreds of years.</p> \n<p>“When you hear about slavery for 400 years – for 400 years? That sound like a choice!” exclaimed West. “Like, you was there for 400 years, and it’s all of y’all? It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison, because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. It’s like slavery, Holocaust, Holocaust, Jews. Slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race, the human race.”</p> \n<p>West’s comments were part of a discussion about his support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and what appears to be his often unhinged attempt at a personal transformation as a “free thinker” who has escaped his “mental prison” and thrown off the chains of politically correct orthodoxy.</p> \n<p>The analogy he appeared to be making – between the relationship of the scars of slavery to the black community and the Holocaust to Jews – invoked the inability of both groups to move past these traumas and forge a positive identity.</p> \n<p>But he also clearly implied that both groups had somehow been trapped in victimhood and passivity, unable and unwilling to fight back at the time they were being oppressed.</p> \n<p>Later Tuesday, West took to Twitter to defend his “free thought” regarding slavery. “For us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>He tweeted what he said was a quote by Harriet Tubman, the slave-rescuing abolitionist: “I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.” It is widely accepted that Tubman never actually said those words, and that she would never have suggested slaves tacitly consented to their own exploitation.</p> \n<p>West also asserted that “If this was 148 years ago I would have been more like Harriet or Nat,” referring to Tubman and Nat Turner – who famously led a Virginia slave insurrection in 1831.</p> \n<p>West’s ideas are similar to characterizations of the Holocaust portraying Jews as going “like sheep to the slaughter.” Jews themselves have not been immune from painting such a picture: Many Jews who survived the genocide in Europe and arrived in the newly established State of Israel recalled an atmosphere in which they were made to feel ashamed of what had happened to them.</p> \n<p>As in the case of West and slavery, such assertions ignored the historical facts that partisan fighting, death camp revolts and ghetto uprisings were all attempted and brutally suppressed – and that the numerous individual acts of resistance ended in widespread death.</p> \n<p>That point was duly noted by Jews on Twitter. The Atlantic writer Adam Serwer, a Jew of color, called out West for his arrogance and ignorance of history.</p> \n<p>“‘Why didn’t the Jews fight back and stop the Holocaust’ and ‘Slavery was a choice’ are related arguments that conveniently elide responsibility on behalf of the people who are actually, you know, responsible,” Serwer wrote.</p> \n<p>He added, “This is like when white people say they would have fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.”</p> \n<p>West was also schooled on the history of resistance to slavery – and the fact that his Tubman quote had indeed been debunked by a number of commentators.</p> \n<p>Professor Marc Lamont Hill tweeted, “There has NEVER been a moment in history when Black people didn’t resist slavery. Some did it by jumping off ships. Some killed masters. Some ran away. Some did it through everyday forms of resistance. Slave masters didn’t retire. Our resistance led to our freedom.”Like many Jews fight Holocaust revisionism, activists and leaders in the black community viewed West’s position as dangerous fuel for the fire of racist white supremacists, seeing it as a form of admission that blacks themselves were somehow responsible for their fates as slaves – and for the racial prejudice they suffer today.&quot;</p> \n<p>Film and theater producer Wendell Pierce called him out, noting: “It is clear that @kanyewest is being sensational for the sake of publicity.

        "text":["<p>The Haifa District Planning and Building Committee last week approved the plan to build a park near the Kishon stream, on an area of about 608 dunams. It will be the largest park to be approved to date in the Haifa metropolitan area, and will eventually be expanded to include additional areas in the eastern part of the stream.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The plan, initiated jointly by the Haifa municipality and the Kishon Stream Authority, proposes construction of a park along the slope of the Kishon. It includes several centers for leisure activities, with a visitors’ center, a sailing club, sports fields, public parks, restaurants, and paths for pedestrians and bicycles. In some areas no construction will be permitted, and the rare and unique natural features of the estuary will be preserved along the length of the stream.</p> \n<p>“This is an important achievement for Haifa area residents, who will benefit from a green lung along one of the longest streams in Israel,” said Haifa district planner Liat Peled. “The park is part of a sequence of open areas all along the Kishon. It is also connected to the path of the Gedura stream that leads to the future park in the Krayot [Haifa satellite towns] and together they will create a varied network of open spaces for the enjoyment of metropolitan Haifa residents.”</p> \n<p>The Israel Ports Company submitted an opposition to the construction of the park. The company has rights to the land planned for construction, which it planned to use for baggage storage, and has yet to receive alternative land, as promised. The district committee examined the agreement reached by the relevant bodies to locate such areas, and decided to approve the plan for a park, after being convinced that it suits the plans of the Israel Ports company.</p> \n<p>The Kishon stream park is also designed to ensure protection of some of the untouched areas still remaining in the region, almost all of which has become a commercial and industrial area. In recent years there has been an improvement in the quality of the water in the stream after the factories along it were forced to improve the quality of the sewage that flows into it. There riverbed was also widened and cleansed of the pollution that accumulated over the years. A small park was built near the fisherman’s anchorage, and will be connected to the new park.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; An inconvenient truth about the cause of air pollution in Haifa &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>In response to the committee decision, Kishon Stream Authority Director Sharon Nissim said: “We welcome the approval of the plan initiated by the authority, for which it fought for years. Yet we still don’t know all the details.” She said that the authority had asked the planning committee to include the eucalyptus trees as part of the park, as agreed in the past with the Israel Ports Company, to widen the green corridor on the southern bank of the stream, and to reduce the commercial areas that are part of the plan. She expressed regret that the committee had not accepted most of their opposition.</p> \n<p>Nissim expressed a hope that in future the Kishon Stream Authority will be able to bring about the expansion of the park, and called on the authorities in the area to help to obtain the budgets necessary for developing it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There are several dangerous ideas along with several intriguing ones in the draft of recommendations of the committee set up to propose reforms in government support for film, which was established by Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The recommendation to increase the cinema budget from 80 million to 100 million shekels ($22 million to $27.5 million) annually, for example, makes it clear that the committee members don’t aspire to destroy Israeli cinema – one of the Israel’s most successful cultural exports and one which miraculously succeeds in creating a positive attitude toward Israel even during periods of harsh international criticism.</p> \n<p>Also praiseworthy is the decision regarding the budget for establishing new cinema foundations. This funding must come from an external source rather than from the film production budget. The recommendation to simplify the criteria for support indicates that the committee members are aware of the superfluous complexity of the criteria, which are spread over 40 pages of cumbersome legalese.</p> \n<p>The recommendation to establish a foundation bypass route, which will enable the awarding of compensation after-the-fact to films that were successful at the box office, constitutes an important attempt to encourage profitable commercial cinema, and not only art films. It was good to discover that the committee – which was established as a result of mudslinging between the minister and the filmmakers, and aroused strong fears among the latter – has proposed several interesting ideas, and didn’t issue a document of recommendations that would lead to the total destruction of the film industry.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Shomer fucking shabbos': How 'The Big Lebowski' bummed its way into cult status &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Even the proposal to establish three regional film foundations, one in Judea and Samaria, is interesting and is likely to lead to new and fresh points of view that are missing in Israeli cinema. Yes, even avowed leftists can find something of interest in a film made from the point of view of a determined hilltop girl with passionate ideology. A film about the settlers’ leaders could be fascinating – as was proven recently by the first episode in the television series “The Right to Shout” by Uri Rosenwaks (which presented the story of the Gush Emunim settler movement, among other things).</p> \n<p>But a perusal of the document also raises a disturbing question: What about the filmmakers who are unable to benefit from the regional foundation to be established right under their noses? We can count on Minister Regev to make sure that the support provided by the foundation in Judea and Samaria will be limited to Israeli citizens, without a cent going to the Palestinians living in that region.</p> \n<p>In that case, the foundation would become the cinematic counterpart of the apartheid roads that bisect the areas of the West Bank – a foundation for Jews only. The Palestinian neighbors of the filmmakers who receive support will be limited to gawking at the sight of the film crews who will pop up on every hill. We can only hope that the new artistic preoccupation of the hilltop youth will take up enough of their time so as to perhaps lead to a few less “price tag” attacks.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; You bet it’s apartheid || Gideon Levy &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Those who may benefit from the recommendations will be the Palestinians living in the Galilee and the Bedouin in the Negev, who may finally be able to tell their own stories rather than being dependent on the good graces of the Jews from the center of the country.</p> \n<p>And still, many questions remain unanswered. Will these foundations support only films by residents of the region? Or perhaps like the Jerusalem Film and Television Fund, which was mentioned in the document as a model to emulate, they will invite filmmakers from all over the world to receive support, on condition that they tell a story that takes place in the region?</p> \n<p>And what will happen in such a case to the residents of the region, who will once again see others receiving the film budgets? And will a specific film be able to receive support from one of the general foundations in addition to the regional one? That would mean it would be the beneficiary of double public funding, so how can this problem be solved?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Jerusalem is boycotting the Israeli film Foxtrot, but the president's wife isn't afraid to say she liked it &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>These questions are particularly disturbing when we examine the paragraph in the document concerning the selection of individuals who will be asked to read scripts and assess their cinematic potential. The committee is expected to recommend that from now on these reviewers be appointed directly by the culture minister.</p> \n<p>The committee members claim that that is the custom in properly administered countries like the Netherlands and France, and that it will help to prevent a conflict of interests stemming from the dependence of these reviewers on the foundations. Despite that, political intervention in the process of appointing the film reviewers is liable to be a dangerous thing. And when we read later in the document that “the reviewers will be intellectuals and cultural figures, not only film people, to reduce the phenomenon of ‘an exclusive club’” – the unease only increases.</p> \n<p>Not only will the film reviewers be appointed in a political fashion, they will also be people who lack a minimal understanding of film, who will be asked to read scripts and to assess their cinematic potential. It’s not certain that these are the people who should choose which films will reach our screens and make decisions that involve the expenditure of tens of millions of shekels in public funds.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The meeting with the commander of the Israel Defense Force’s Gaza Division, Brig. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs, was set to take place next to the Black Arrow monument, which is perched on a hill overlooking the Gaza Strip adjacent to Kibbutz Mefalsim. The site commemorates the reprisal raids in the 1950s, the army of Moshe Dayan and Arik Sharon, which is otherwise now relegated to the history books, holiday supplements in newspapers and courses dealing with the IDF’s legacy in battle. The monument bears the name of the paratroops operation in Gaza in which Aluf Horowitz was killed. One of the authors is named for Horowitz, his uncle; he now has his picture taken by the memorial plaque.</p> \n<p>From here we embarked on a tour along the border fence with the divisional commander, a few hours after an explosive device went off alongside it, two weeks before the start of the Palestinians’ “marches of return” on the Gaza side of the fence.</p> \n<p>The military mission here is basically quite similar to that of the period of the reprisal operations: preventing the return of refugees from their camps in the Strip to the land from which they were uprooted in the War of Independence, and protecting the communities on the Israeli side, which was once called the “frontier area” but today is categorized by the less heroic name of “Gaza envelope.”</p> \n<p>The means of carrying out this mission, however, have changed beyond recognition. The focus of the 2018 IDF is defense and fortification. In interwar periods, its cross-border operations are mostly carried out from the air, with their exact details hidden from the eye. The current era is almost completely without stories of courage under fire or heroic folkloristic characters such as the paratroops commanders of yore.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to imagine a greater contrast than that between the reprisal raids that are described on the monument and the vast project of the subterranean anti-tunnel barrier that the IDF is now building along the border here. Fuchs takes us to construction sites where the immense machines recall those being used to build the underground rail line in Tel Aviv. He offers us detailed technical explanations about construction methods, materials and quantities, as if he were an infrastructure engineer and not a combat officer who’s spent most of his years on the front lines.</p> \n<p>Some 3 billion shekels (currently about $852 million) will be invested in a huge concrete wall equipped with sensors to detect tunneling, to be installed below ground and completed by the end of 2019. Five hundred people are engaged in the construction; five cement plants have been built nearby to avoid long trips by trucks on narrow Negev roads. Above it are earth ramparts with built-in tank-firing positions, which on recent weekends have been used by army snipers to fire on Palestinian demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Slogans used in the past by the IDF’s founders – “active defense,” “few against many,” “moving the war to enemy territory” – in which generations of officers and soldiers were schooled, now look like fairy tales from another planet in light of the abundance of means the IDF now employs in the Gaza sector.</p> \n<p>Two essential things have changed since Aluf Horowitz and his buddies were sent to attack camps of the Egyptian army, which controlled the Gaza Strip at the time. Israel has developed into a thriving country, which can devote far greater resources to security needs. At the same time, it is no longer willing to accept the loss of soldiers on the scale that was understood and accepted in the state’s early years. Eight military funerals, as was the case following Operation Black Arrow, would today be perceived as a national calamity obliging Israel to go to war – exactly as occurred almost 12 years ago, in the Second Lebanon War (when another eight soldiers were killed on the same day that two fallen reservists, Eldad Regev and Udi Goldwasser, were abducted). That constraint dictates the current conception of border defense: Do whatever needs doing, all that matters is for the boys to come home safely. That is the supreme imperative of the government and of Israeli society.</p> \n<p>During the past few weeks we journeyed the length and breadth of the land of bitahon shotef – Hebrew for ongoing or routine security. We met the army’s “work contractors”: the territorial division commanders in the north, the West Bank and Gaza, and the commander of the Israel Air Force’s Palmahim base, from which most of the operational sorties depart. They are three kibbutzniks, one moshav member and one product of a Zionist, ultra-Orthodox home in Jerusalem who became a kibbutz member as an adult.</p> \n<p>The mission of the four divisional chiefs, two of whom serve in the north, is thankless, snafu-prone, exposed to the media and requires them to be always looking over their shoulder. They need to internalize the security policy that’s dictated from above, from the political leadership and from the bureau of the IDF chief of staff, and to remember that even if the border is breached, their task is to absorb and contain the incident and prevent a general escalation. They also need to keep in mind that, if war breaks out, it will be decided by other forces. Fear of losses isn’t a mere slogan for them: All of them tell about comrades-in-arms and subordinates who were killed by their sides or while under their responsibility. Clearly, these are images that have been burned into their consciousness.</p> \n<p>The IAF operates differently, living on its bases and under centralized operational control from the “Pit” at the Kirya – defense establishment headquarters in Tel Aviv – but more involved than in the past in IDF ground activity. Indeed, it even operates in the “below ground” in Gaza, as Palmahim base commander Brig. Gen. Nimrod Shifroni puts it.</p> \n<p>Simple military equation</p> \n<p>Our first stop was the Judea and Samaria Division, which under the cover of a newspeak mission – “preserving territorial security” – maintains Israeli control in the West Bank, the occupation that is incarnated in the form of the tall pillbox fortifications along the roads, and that safeguards the settlements. The divisional commander, Brig. Gen. Eran Niv, hosts us in Hebron on the morning of Purim, March 1, at the conclusion of the local settlers’ traditional costumed procession, an event that often triggers friction and unrest. This time it ended with the throwing of a plastic bottle at the head of a company commander, before we arrived. We saw only a few drunk young people walking along the path that leads from the Tel Rumeida neighborhood to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, bearing a bottle of wine and babbling loudly.</p> \n<p>A large poster at the entrance to the Hebron Brigade commander’s office depicts the history of Jewish settlement in the city, from the patriarch Abraham and King David down to the present day. A quick glance is all that’s needed to understand the mission of the soldiers here: to sustain a settlement in the heart of a large Palestinian city. An IDF battalion is permanently allocated for that mission.</p> \n<p>Niv shows us the division’s activity graph. The troops’ principal task is to block occasional outbursts of demonstrations and terror attacks, under the constant fear of a new intifada. Niv is occupied with adjusting the deployment of the forces to the constraints and concentrating the effort in problematic places, without requesting reinforcements from the General Staff. At his disposal is a small number of battalions, about half of them reserve battalions, and a Border Police unit.</p> \n<p>The military equation is simple: The calmer the West Bank is, the more units that can engage in training. The method, in Niv's words: “Precision action against those involved in violence, in order not to drag the majority of the Palestinian civilian population into a confrontation, and not to automatically impose a closure on 200,000 people in Nablus because of a terrorist attack.” He knows that a local incident is liable to lead to bloodshed. Niv’s silent partners are the members of the Palestinian security “apparatuses.” Coordination with them is working successfully, far from the eyes of the public.</p> \n<p>The divisional commander grew up in Kibbutz Erez, north of the Gaza Strip, served in the Nahal Brigade and, like the other divisional chiefs we met, was stationed in southern Lebanon and in the territories. He first gained fame in Hebron as a battalion commander who overcame a terrorist squad that killed 12 personnel belonging to the security forces in an attack along the “worshippers’ road” leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs during the second intifada. (The commander of the Hebron Brigade at the time, Col. Dror Weinberg, was killed in the incident; the conference room attached to the brigade commander’s office is named for him).</p> \n<p>Niv, who is described by one of his subordinates as being “among the few IDF commanders capable of thinking and running with a knife between their teeth at the same time,” takes us on a tour through Hebron’s Palestinian neighborhoods in a jeep covered with heavy metal plating. The stones thrown at us along the way bounce off the vehicle’s sides and barely bother the occupants.</p> \n<p>In the course of the tour it emerges that this vehicle isn’t enough for the IDF these days: We’re shown a new one that’s come into use, the Ze’ev (wolf) armored personnel carrier. It is a wheeled and not tracked APC, higher, more heavily protected and more threatening. For someone who remembers doing regular army service in Lebanon, when we drove in open jeeps in places that posed a constant threat of roadside bombs and shooting ambushes – this level of protection looks crazy, yet another massive investment to prevent soldiers from being exposed to danger. The approach according to which no unnecessary risks are taken is brought home vividly when we get out to observe the city from a dominant hill, on which the IDF has established a large, company-size outpost. The commanding officers who host us are armed; one of them is posted to cover us, even though no one is visible anywhere.</p> \n<p>The Hebron Brigade commander, Col. Itzik Cohen, takes us to the Jewish settlement in the city, and shows us the new defense structure built around it after the Elor Azaria affair (referring to the soldier who shot a wounded terrorist in Hebron in 2016). About 1,000 Jews live here amid 200 Palestinian families, and even for someone who’s been here before, the sight is oppressive. The Palestinians are now required to pass through fortified gates, with metal detectors, opaque glass and a loudspeaker system, which prevent physical contact with the soldiers. Anyone carrying a knife is locked in an automatic trap activated by a soldier sitting behind a thick glass wall.</p> \n<p>Cohen presents the data: During the past year, since the gates were installed, 86 Palestinians carrying knives have been apprehended here. About a third of them told their interrogators that they had planned to stab soldiers. The others wanted to be caught and jailed, in order to extricate themselves from personal and family problems. Thanks to the new technology, none of the knife carriers was shot or harmed. When there are no casualties there is no escalation, and there are no cases like that of Azaria, an episode that continues to rattle the IDF. It’s the same formula again: invest massive resources and technology and spare yourself trouble, investigations and dishonorable discharges.</p> \n<p>Still, the numbers provided by the brigade commander illustrate the depth of the Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation. Even after half a century of Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron, there are dozens of people who are ready to risk lengthy imprisonment, disability or death in order to try to attack a soldier or a settler, in an impossible balance of forces.</p> \n<p>These events are barely reported in Israel, and the majority of the population that lives within the Green Line is totally indifferent to them. But here in Hebron a war of attrition is being fought, its intensity constantly fluctuating. Cohen doesn’t wait for the enemy from the safety of fortified positions – his soldiers carry out night missions to make arrests and search for homemade weapons and domestic arms-making sites. He gets two or three hours of sleep a day, plans the night operations in the morning and at night follows them from the war room. He sees his four children during rare breaks and on Shabbat, though he spends some Sabbaths with the brigade, too.</p> \n<p>Cohen tells us that he has a lot of latitude in terms of choosing targets, methods and timing. A few days earlier, his troops caught some Jewish lawbreakers from Be’er Sheva, members of a criminal organization who had come to buy arms from a Palestinian dealer equipped with a fake contract to purchase a car, to mask their underhanded business. The police called to praise him for saving the lives of the victims of an intended hit on a rival gang.</p> \n<p>For the brigade commander, the night actions are aimed at intercepting terrorist attacks early, before the weapons and the explosives make their way into Israel. He shows us photographs of arms caches in Hebron homes. Once more it looks as though, despite all the operations and the advanced means, the quality intelligence and the continuing settlement project, there are enough Palestinians who haven’t lost the motivation to fight.</p> \n<p>Minefield maneuvers</p> \n<p>The commanding officers we met take the other side seriously. The phenomenon of scorning the enemy, which was rampant in the IDF following the Six-Day War of 1967, in the style of “let them come – we’ll break their bones,” has long since vanished.</p> \n<p>Brig. Gen. Fuchs shows us through binoculars the observation posts of Hamas and Islamic Jihad across the fence, beyond the 300-meter “security zone” that Israel set up after withdrawing from the Gaza Strip. He describes the development of the locally based military force in regard to operational capability, spirit of battle and stratagems developed to cope with the IDF’s range of abilities. And he tells us about a booby-trapped explosive device that was hidden in the pole of a Palestinian flag that was hoisted on the fence and wounded four soldiers a few weeks earlier.</p> \n<p>In the weeks after our visit, tension in Gaza surged in the wake of an organized Palestinian effort to initiate demonstrations of thousands of people close to the border fence. The advent of the demonstrations was accompanied by a series of infiltrations from the Strip via the old fence, which the IDF is now in the process of replacing by means of the huge engineering project against the tunnels. Some Israeli media outlets described the infiltrations as a resounding failure for the IDF. The pressure on the army’s top brass, from Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, down through the divisional commander and his brigade chiefs, was apparent in the days before the first weekend of demonstrations.</p> \n<p>The rules of engagement issued to the forces reflected that, and in three weekends, 40 Palestinians, most of them unarmed demonstrators, were killed in proximity to the border. This is the almost-permanent minefield in which the sector commander has to maneuver: Any infiltration, certainly of terrorists, will be immediately headlined as a screw-up, and necessitate an investigation and sometimes also demands for heads to roll, regardless of the load under which the unit operates regularly. On the other hand, toughening the policy will often cause additional casualties on the other side and is liable to embroil the IDF and the state in international criticism. Sometimes, as in the recent affair of the snipers, it will also bring about the renewal of the domestic political debate.</p> \n<p>Effective enemy</p> \n<p>Recognition that the enemy is sophisticated and dangerous is even more deeply engraved in the consciousness of the two divisional commanders in the north. We drive to Galilee during Passover week, spending hours in traffic jams, and recall that the lively movement of holiday-makers is the best gauge of quiet on the border. The commander of the Galilee Division, Brig. Gen. Rafi Milo, meets us in a grove adjacent to the Nabi Yusha police fort, scene of one of the best-known battles of 1948. Around us, Christian Arab families are celebrating Easter with barbecues.</p> \n<p>Milo, analytic and precise, has prepared a detailed survey on a yellow writing pad. He served in the naval commandos and returned to service after the ambush suffered by the unit in 1997 in Lebanon. (His Gaza counterpart, Fuchs, was the commander of the Nahal Brigade’s antitank unit that year, and 10 of his soldiers were killed in the helicopter disaster in February 1997. Those were two of the incidents in whose wake the IDF would withdraw from southern Lebanon three years later.) Milo has commanded a Golani Brigade battalion, the naval commandos and afterward the Edom Division, which is responsible for the border with Egypt and the southern part of the border with Jordan. He took command of the Lebanon sector last summer.</p> \n<p>In contrast to his colleagues in the West Bank and Gaza, whose operational networks are constantly engaged in activities, Milo lives in a dual reality. Most of the time there is absolute quiet – but opposite him is Hezbollah, the most effective military force among Israel’s enemies. A flare-up here will be more violent and dangerous than in any other sector. Hezbollah is deployed in three “arms”: territorial defense units that protect the border; rocket and missile units deep within Lebanon; and the offensive Radwan Force, which according to declarations by Hezbollah’s secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, is designated to occupy Galilee in a future war. The organization’s offensive force is occupied in Syria, and Milo’s assessment is that Hezbollah has no interest in a war with Israel at this time – but the danger of a deterioration exists. It’s liable to happen in response to an Israeli attack in Syria, or to the wall that Israel is building along sections of the border, west of Metula and east of Rosh Hanikra.</p> \n<p>On a routine basis, the supreme task of the divisional commander is to prevent escalation in the wake of border incidents. On the offensive side, the IDF is now occupied with the “campaign between the wars” – consisting largely of aerial attacks intended to thwart the military aggrandizement of Hezbollah and other terrorist and guerrilla forces, and more recently also of Iran in Syria. He knows that the campaign is more important than a tactical victory over a small Hezbollah force, if it’s an avoidable incident. Putting this understanding into practice obligates close supervision of the junior commanders and imparting the principles of Israel’s strategy in the north to the intermediate levels as well.</p> \n<p>In anticipation of warfare, Milo is readying for a Hezbollah invasion of Galilee and an attempt to capture an Israeli community, amid possible disruption of the organization of reservist forces and interference in the evacuation of civilians southward. Here, in this sector, too, the IDF is investing vast resources in planning; many aspects of its efforts are defensive, such as building walls and embankments at points of possible breakthrough by Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>Milo talks about a rapid counterattack to the Lebanon side, should a war break out. That’s his mission. Other systems and units in the IDF are charged with dealing with rockets and with the civilian home front. In the meantime, these are all contingency plans; day-to-day life is passed here in keeping an eye on Hezbollah personnel who patrol the border in civilian attire and in meaningless conversations with members of UNIFIL, the United Nations force deployed in this sector.</p> \n<p>We cross the verdant Hula Valley and navigate the ascent to the Golan Heights, to observe the Kuneitra region. The divisional intelligence officer shows us the rebel-controlled villages and the line of progress of President Bashar Assad’s forces. His assessment is that the regime’s next target in the area will be the city of Daraa, the cradle of the rebellion, southeast of here. Israel is providing the villages of the Syrian Golan with aid that is “mainly humanitarian,” in the words of our hosts. Their existence creates a kind of security zone for Israel across the border. But the IDF, having learned the lesson of its lengthy cooperation with the South Lebanon Army, with its gloomy aftermath, is playing down its ties with the other side.</p> \n<p>‘Syrians on the fences’</p> \n<p>The commander of the Bashan Division, Brig. Gen. Amit Fisher, grew up on Kibbutz Merom Hagolan, in the Golan Heights, not far from our observation point, and spent most of his military service in the Golani infantry brigade. Ehud Barak, during his term as defense minister, often spoke with high regard about “Fisher and Zini,” two battalion commanders in the Golani Brigade, who in the meantime have risen to the rank of divisional commanders (Brig. Gen. David Zini now heads a reservist division in Central Command). Fisher is a few years younger than his colleagues and he’s the only one of them who’s now serving in his first posting as a brigadier. He took over the division about two months ago.</p> \n<p>He hosts us at the Nafah base in the center of the Heights, which Syrian tanks reached in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. It’s here that the phrase “the Syrians are at the fences” was coined, and here that divisional commander Rafael Eitan won glory. But those threats belong to the distant past. The present-day threat that concerns Fisher is not an assault by Syrian divisions but a terrorist infiltration. And here, too, as with Gaza and Lebanon, Israel’s initial response was to build a new barrier, high and sophisticated. These fences, whose construction in all the sectors is being coordinated by Brig. Gen. Eran Ophir, head of the IDF-Defense Ministry security-fence project, are the most salient manifestation of Israel’s current security policy. When historians come to survey the past decade, they are likely to discover that a person little known to the Israeli public left a significant physical impact on the face of the land.</p> \n<p>Fisher is worried about a possible trickle of Hezbollah and Iranian Revolutionary Guards personnel into the sector – in order to conduct surveillance on the Israeli side, to recruit local collaborators and to prepare future operations. This would constitute the embodiment of the “Iranian deployment across the border” that the country’s civilian and military leaders have been warning about. Since our visit with Fisher and his neighbor Milo, the ante in the north has been raised. Seven Iranian advisers were killed on April 10 in an aerial attack attributed to Israel on a Syrian airbase next to Homs, and Tehran has threatened direct revenge. Along the borders, in Gaza but even more so in the north, the week of Memorial and Independence Days passed in tense anticipation of a possible violent payback by the enemy.</p> \n<p>Fisher, charismatic and articulate, talks without fear of taking an offensive stance. The tanks that Assad deployed in the buffer zone a few months ago, in violation of the separation of forces agreement with Israel, are to him legitimate targets for attack, after the diplomatic efforts to enforce the agreement have been played out. But anyone fantasizing about a new Ariel Sharon who will expand the limits of his sector so as to strike at the enemy, gets a lecture from Fisher about the importance of discipline and obeying orders. In the course of rising through the ranks he has seen outstanding commanders who excelled in battle but cut corners in periods of quiet, having to leave the army under unpleasant circumstances.</p> \n<p>Defense by remote control</p> \n<p>Our journey ends in the base at Palmahim, which competes with Tel Nof for the title of largest IAF base. The primary force here consists of a few squadrons of drones, in addition to which the air defense system has also been developing in recent years – from Iron Dome to the Arrow missiles. From here, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, the defense of the country’s borders is implemented by remote control. “If you look at an aerial photograph of Israel on Yom Kippur,” base commander Shifroni says, “you see only our remotely controlled drones along all the borders.”</p> \n<p>These drones are the IDF’s rapid response force. Constantly airborne, they are operated by shift-rotation personnel. And they too offer broad margins of defense from possible entanglement.</p> \n<p>It sometimes happens that one of the drones falls, as occurred in late March in Lebanon. According to Shifroni, such events are not pleasant and demand an inquiry, but usually no one is hurt and the public reaction in the wake of the loss of a Hermes 450 – which most people have not even heard of – is negligible compared to that following the downing of the F-16 and the ejection of its two pilots over northern Israel two months ago.</p> \n<p>In terms of flight hours, the remotely controlled drones are responsible for most of the IAF’s operational activity. More and more missions are being shifted to them instead of using manned aircraft, Shifroni notes. These include long-distance photographic sorties, which used to pose great risks to pilots. Still, this is a gradual process, and he believes that pilots will continue to occupy the cockpits for many years to come, just as automatic cars aren’t yet driving on the streets.</p> \n<p>Shifroni grew up in Kibbutz Yiftah, on the Lebanon border, and did his IAF service as a pilot and a commander in the helicopter unit, in a track that included staff posts, too, as is customary in the force. The motto of his base refers to “victorious cooperation” with the ground forces. We’re joined by Lt. Col. Gilad (his surname is classified), who commands one of the two Blackhawk helicopter squadrons on the base. Both he and Shifroni describe the ever-tightening relations between the ground and air branches. Shifroni relates that the air force is a background partner in every ground mission, even when it comes arrests in the West Bank, in case of complications that require backup.</p> \n<p>We heard similar descriptions from the divisional commanders. They told us that one way to reduce the forces in operational activity, in order to increase time spent in training, is to entrust part of the routine security missions to the air force. Today warplanes are on constant alert for rapid intervention in border incidents, fueled and armed and ready to take off. In practice, they serve as the reserve force of the divisional commanders in the north.</p> \n<p>Just a few kilometers from the base is Palmahim beach. Only a few sun-seekers are there on this ordinary weekday, just before the official start of the swimming season. Above the dunes we see a drone, followed by a warplane, heading out for missions – secret or not, routine or unusual – toward the northern front and the territories. Another day of routine security and deployment for trouble, in the hope that it won’t come.</p>",

One member of the group is still missing. A search party has found the body of a teenage girl of around 17 in the Dead Sea area, but authorities do not yet know whether it is the body of the missing teen. The search for the missing person, conducted by police volunteers and Israeli army rescue helicopters, stopped as night fell.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Text messages show&nbsp;that one of the girls&nbsp;who was killed&nbsp;told friends she was worried for her safety on the hike, the Israel Television News Company reported.&nbsp;&quot;I can't believe I'm actually going hiking in weather like this. It doesn't make sense to go to a place that's completely flooded. It's tempting fate. We're going to die – I'm serious,&quot; she wrote to her friends on the messaging application WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>The nine victims have been identified by authorities as&nbsp;Ella Or, from the settlement of Ma’ale Adumim; Gali Belali, from the central city of Givatayim; Agam Levi, from Moshav Herut in central Israel; Shani Samir, from the central town of Shoham; Adi Ra’anan, from the coastal community of Mikhmoret; Yael Sadan and Maayan Barhum from Jerusalem; Romi Cohen, from Moshav Maor in the north and Tzur Alfi, from the central town of Mazekeret Batya.</p> \n<p>Fifteen other members of the group, which is based in Tel Aviv, were rescued. Two were suffering from hypothermia and were taken to Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva for treatment.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'We're going to die': Text messages reveal teenage flood victim feared for her life on hike &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>&quot;Israel grieves the promising young lives that were cut off by this tragedy in the Arava,&quot;&nbsp;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.&nbsp;&quot;We embrace the families with grief and pray for the speedy recovery of the wounded.&quot;</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin wrote about the flood on Twitter, saying &quot;Our thoughts and prayers go to our brothers, children, our loved ones, and those in danger. We're following the situation in the south closely and are sending a warm embrace to the affected families. We will strengthen and lend help to the forces who are currently working to rescue, find and treat those injured. I ask all to please follow their instructions.&quot;</p> \n<p>Police launch investigation</p> \n<p>Police have opened an investigation into the deaths, with an expected&nbsp; focus on the organizers of the pre-army program on suspicion of of death by negligence. At this stage, however, police efforts will remain focused on finding the one hiker who remains missing.</p> \n<p>All of the agencies responsible for collecting rainfall and flooding information in the south saw to it to issue rather clear warnings on Wednesday and Thursday regarding the risk of flooding in the area where the group was hiking near the Tzafit stream. The warning related to general areas and did not relate specifically to the stream. (More specific warnings are not issued because it is difficult to predict what will happen in a specific stream).</p> \n<p>The Israel Meteorological Service also issued a warning on the risk of flooding in the Dead Sea region, the southern Judean Desert and the Arava. It should be noted that even relatively small quantities of rainfall in the desert can cause powerful flood waters.</p> \n<p>Warnings were also issued by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Tamar Regional Council, the local government in the area around the Dead Sea and to its west and south. The Tamar Regional Council&nbsp;asked that members of the public refrain from coming to the Dead Sea area and the Arava region to its south as a result of the dangers posed by flooding and bad weather.</p> \n<p>Due to high winds on Thursday, the Masada National Park near the Dead Sea was closed to the public. The Barak stream, further south, was declared off limits to visitors after the floods damaged safety installations there. A stretch of Highway 40 in the south was also closed to traffic.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Thursday, a hiker in the vicinity of the Michmash stream suffered fractures following a ten-meter (32 foot) fall and was evacuated in moderate condition.</p> \n<p>The winds are expected to continue on Friday, and similar caution is advised.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Two teenagers died in flash floods on Wednesday as Israel endured heavy rains and hail.</p> \n<p>Israel was hit by unusually heavy rain on Wednesday, accompanied by hail in many places. Coming at the tail end of the winter rainy season, it took many Israelis by surprise and caused flooding around the country.</p> \n<p>A meteorologist from the Meteo-Tech weather firm said the weather was caused by a large and powerful storm cloud extending 10 kilometers (6 miles) into the atmosphere. Twenty-five millimeters (an inch) of rain fell in Tel Aviv in the space of an hour while the Jerusalem area was hit by a huge 45 to 50 millimeter (about 2 inches) downpour.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The rain is expected to come to an end on Friday night. Temperatures will remain below normal for the end of April. Saturday will be warmer with temperatures reaching seasonal averages. Sunday will be pleasant and warmer.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A pesticide, suspected of increasing the risk of Parkinson’s disease, is widely used in Israel despite the fact that the health and environmental protection ministries have recommended halting its use.</p> \n<p>The Ministry of Agriculture opposes a ban on paraquat because it views the pesticide as crucial to farming and says there is an absence of suitable alternatives.</p> \n<p>In Israel paraquat, an herbicide, is widely used in vineyards and citrus groves, and in potato and cotton fields.</p> \n<p>A few months ago the Health Ministry prepared an opinion recommending that use of the substance be stopped. Not only does it poison those using it, wrote the ministry, but also cited studies on laboratory animals and among agricultural workers suggesting a link between paraquat and the onset of Parkinson’s disease. In laboratory animals exposure to the substance caused behavioral changes that were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson’s in human beings.</p> \n<p>In a study conducted in the United States it was found that workers using paraquat were 2.5 times more likely to contract Parkinson’s.</p> \n<p>The Environmental Protection Ministry wrote that the substance should not be used due to its very serious and damaging effects on health, including many cases of death.</p> \n<p>A study conducted in the Negev found a link between the percentage of Parkinson’s patients in the communities and their proximity to agricultural areas where substances such as paraquat were used. In these communities there may be up to 50 percent more Parkinson’s sufferers.</p> \n<p>The findings were presented Dr. Yair Zlotnik of the neurology department of Soroka Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, at a professional discussion on the issue held last week by the Environmental Protection Ministry.</p> \n<p>Zlotnik stressed that these findings don’t necessarily prove a causal connection between the disease and use of the substance, but demonstrates a connection between living near these agricultural areas and an increase in morbidity.</p> \n<p>Zlotnik said that the limitations of the study include an absence of precise information about which pesticides were used, and an absence of information about the patients’ ethnic origin and history. Parkinson’s can also have genetic causes, which is why the patients’ origin is very important.</p> \n<p>The Agriculture Ministry noted the difficulty in discontinuing use of the substance due to an absence of suitable alternatives.</p> \n<p>The Agriculture Ministry responded that “the ministry is reexamining 50 active ingredients in over 100 pesticides that are presently approved for use. In this context the ministry is examining the advantages and disadvantages of parquat, which is approved in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, is very helpful against a wide variety of weeds, disintegrates quickly after use, without leaving any vestiges in the plant. The ministry has not yet made a decision, and the attempt to influence its opinion via the media is wrong and unprofessional.”</p> \n<p>Paraquat was banned a decade ago in the European Union.</p> \n<p>In the United States the substance can be used only by workers who have received special training. In Israel there is no similar restriction on the agricultural use of the substance.</p>",

The White House did not provide further details of the phone call.  Yesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Much&nbsp;of the conversation centered on Iran, Pompeo said following the meeting. “We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s dangerous escalation of threats to Israel and the region and Iran’s ambition to dominate the Middle East remains. The United States is with Israel in this fight.”  -- &quot;Syria Missile Strikes Reportedly Kill at Least 16&quot; by&nbsp;Ben Hubbard:&nbsp;&quot;Missile strikes in Syria hit military bases used by Iran and its proxy militias fighting in the civil war there, killing at least 16 people...&nbsp;There was no claim of responsibility for the strikes, but suspicion fell on Israel, which has repeatedly bombed what are believed to be Iranian convoys in Syria transporting weapons to its regional allies... The Israeli military... declined to comment on whether it had carried out the strikes on Sunday.&quot; [NYTimes]  &quot;Pompeo and Palestinians Have ‘Nothing to Discuss’ Amid Gaza Crisis&quot; by Gardiner Harris and Isabel Kershner:&nbsp;&quot;No one at the State Department called Palestinian leaders to ask for a get-together with Mr. Pompeo, according to Palestinian officials. And that may be because the Americans knew the answer they would have gotten: No...&nbsp;“No meeting in Ramallah on his first visit sets an ominous tone about prospects for any progress, or even dialogue, with the Palestinians,” said Daniel B. Shapiro.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  &quot;Pompeo says Israel, Palestinian peace still a US priority&quot; by Matt Lee:&nbsp;&quot;He said the United States is open to a two-state solution to the conflict if both parties agree, calling it a &quot;likely outcome.&quot; But he would not agree with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi's characterization of the conflict as &quot;the main cause of instability&quot; in the region. &quot;The parties will ultimately make the decision as to what the correct resolution is,&quot; Pompeo told reporters at a joint news conference with Safadi. &quot;We are certainly open to a two-party solution as a likely outcome.&quot;&nbsp;[ABCNews]&nbsp;  VIEW FROM RIYADH -- “Saudi Crown Prince: Palestinians should take what the U.S. offers” by Barak Ravid: “In a closed-door meeting with heads of Jewish organizations in New York on March 27th, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) gave harsh criticism of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), according to an Israeli foreign ministry cable sent by a diplomat from the Israeli consulate in New York The Saudi Crown Prince told the Jewish leaders: &quot;In the last several decades the Palestinian leadership has missed one opportunity after the other and rejected all the peace proposals it was given. It is about time the Palestinians take the proposals and agree to come to the negotiations table or shut up and stop complaining.&quot;  “A source who was briefed on the meeting told me the attendees were stunned when they heard the Saudi Crown Prince comments on the Palestinian issue. &quot;People literally fell off their chairs,&quot; the source said.” [Axios]&nbsp;&nbsp;  --&nbsp;&quot;Saudi court starts trial of two Arabs accused of spying for Mossad&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Marwa Rashad:&nbsp;&quot;A Saudi Arabian court began the trial of two Jordanians accused of spying against the kingdom for Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency...&quot; [Reuters]&nbsp;  Jordan, Israel, Palestinians in rare Japan-hosted meeting:&nbsp;&quot;The Japanese foreign minister has presided over a rare meeting of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian officials to push ahead with an agro-industrial park intended to enhance cross-border trade and cooperation.&quot; [AP]&nbsp;  &quot;Pompeo swaps no-profile espionage for overt diplomacy&quot; by Matt Lee:&nbsp;&quot;I haven’t been to my office yet,&quot; Pompeo quipped on Sunday after meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on only his third full day on the job.&quot; [AP]&nbsp;  Aaron David Miller&nbsp;and Richard Sokolsky write... &quot;As Pompeo's star rises in Trumpland, Haley and Kushner risk getting eclipsed:&nbsp;[Mike] Pompeo's star will eclipse that of Haley -- who recently angered Trump, and not for the first time, with a statement about&nbsp;new sanctions&nbsp;against Russia -- and she will likely assume a lower public profile in deference to Pompeo... Kushner's wings have been clipped by the Mueller investigation; he's keeping his head down and out of the line of fire. He can claim no foreign policy successes; Middle East peace diplomacy, which he owned lock, stock and barrel, is going nowhere. Pompeo knows it and seems determined to wrestle back foreign policy authority from the White House. The odds are in his favor.&quot; [CNN]  IRAN DEAL --&nbsp;After visiting Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Pompeo accused Iran of &quot;behaving worse&quot; since signing the 2015 nuclear deal, asserting that if the U.S.&nbsp;fails to reach a new deal with the Europeans, Trump will withdraw from the&nbsp;deal.&quot; Talking to reporters en route&nbsp;to Israel, Pompeo brushed aside concerns that a decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal could impact negotiations with North Korea. At a campaign-style rally in Michigan on Saturday, Trump critiqued&nbsp;the previous administration ahead of his&nbsp;highly-anticipated&nbsp;summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. &quot;Strength will keep us out of nuclear war,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not gonna be a John Kerry who makes a horrible Iran deal.&quot;&nbsp;  National Security Advisor John Bolton said on Fox News Sunday: &quot;Trump has made no decision on the nuclear deal, whether to stay in or get out.&quot; [Video]&nbsp;  &quot;Squeeze Iran and It Will Cave Like North Korea, Top Israeli Minister Says&quot;&nbsp;by&nbsp;Ethan Bronner:&nbsp;&quot;If North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons, credit belongs to President Donald Trump for his aggressive rhetoric and increased sanctions -- and a similar policy would defang Iran...

Chris Coons (D-DE) on Fox News Sunday:&nbsp;&quot;If President Trump can successfully lead an effort with our European allies to rein in or to end their ballistic missile program, to change the outcome of the current Iranian deal so there isn't a sunset clause&nbsp;— I think these will be positive things that I would support.&quot; [Video]  Peter Beinart writes... &quot;Trump May Already Be Violating the Iran Deal:&nbsp;Section 22 of the deal specifically obliges the United States, subject to some restrictions, to “allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services to Iran.” ... Erich Ferrari, a lawyer in Washington who works on sanctions issues, told me there’s “definitely been a shift. Certain transactions that we’ve seen licensed in the past under the Obama administration, are now being denied.” ...&nbsp;The Trump administration has never fully complied with the nuclear deal, and likely never will.

Mr. Trump revealed new details about his deliberations on the decision to construct a temporary facility, saying he almost signed off on a $1 billion plan. “I had my name half-signed, then I noticed the figure. I never got to the word ‘Trump,’” he said...&nbsp;Mr. Trump said he then called David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, who told him he could relocate the embassy for $150,000...&nbsp;In the end, the U.S. spent about $400,000 to retrofit a complex in Jerusalem’s Arnona neighborhood, U.S. officials said. “It will be somewhat temporary, but it could be for many years,” Mr. Trump said.&quot; [WSJ; WashPost]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY AT THE JPOST CONFERENCE IN NYC&nbsp;-- Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) on&nbsp;Trump’s decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem:&nbsp;“Every country determines its own capital – what’s the big news here? I don't see this as a major decision by the president of the U.S. (the audience&nbsp;booed this line). The manner in which the president handled it, in my view, was a missed opportunity. But Israel’s capital is Jerusalem, and we’ve all recognized that and will continue to recognize that.&quot;&nbsp;  -- &quot;Reporter's Notebook: Effusive celebration of Israel in NY&quot; by Lahav Harkov:&nbsp;&quot;When I interviewed Senator Ben Cardin – the senior US Senator from Maryland, the former ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a Democrat – you could get whiplash from the crowd, cheering one minute and jeering the next. Few could doubt Cardin’s pro-Israel bona fides in his decades of public service, but when he mentioned that he spoke at the J Street Conference, the crowd seemed to do just that, and began to jeer.&nbsp;And they booed again when Cardin gave Congress credit for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital 23 years ago, as opposed to US President Donald Trump.&quot; [JPost]  HIGHLIGHTS -- Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Trump's Jerusalem move:&nbsp;&quot;It should have happened many years ago... However, before we get overjoyed,&nbsp;let's not forget that in Trump's announcement he refers to the West side of Jerusalem, and he also said that the final borders will be&nbsp;determined in negotiations, which means that he does not necessarily accept that all Arab neighborhoods ought to be part of Jerusalem. We rather have a Jewish Jerusalem, and I&nbsp;hope it will be recognized by the entire international community soon.&quot;&nbsp;  Olmert on Trump's&nbsp;peace plan:&nbsp;&quot;From past experience, we know that America can't impose on any of the sides to do what they don't want to do. It depends what the plan is. But for the time being, if the president will sponsor a thoughtful and forthcoming peace initiative, I think it will be a positive step forward...&nbsp;If there is peace between us and the Palestinians, then overnight there will be peace between Israel and 10 Arab Muslim countries and Israel will become the capital of the Middle East and all the money coming to the region will pass through Tel Aviv.”&nbsp;  Former IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi:&nbsp;“I think Trump will nix the deal. I think nixing the&nbsp;deal is a good idea. It's time&nbsp;the world - and I am glad that the Trump Administration understands the real nature of Iran... The real issue is whether the Iranian will decide to go for the [nuclear] bomb.”  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC):&nbsp;&quot;I want to applaud President Trump for understanding this [Iran] deal sucks. I hope we get out unless we make it better&nbsp;because its a lousy deal.&quot;  Ron Lauder:&nbsp;&quot;In many ways, the World Jewish Congress serves as Israel's foreign ministry. Which is a good thing, because Israel is probably the only country in the world right now that doesn't have its own foreign minister... Imagine if Israel bought one less F-16 plane, and used that money on hasbara. What a difference that would make.&quot;&nbsp;  -- Lauder on Trump:&nbsp;&quot;With the most pro-Israel president in American history,&nbsp;Donald J. Trump, I believe that peace is possible and within reach. And we all thank President Trump for his historic courage in moving the American embassy to&nbsp;Jerusalem.&quot; [Video]&nbsp;  Anthony Scaramucci, defending Trump over his Charlottesville 'both sides' comments:&nbsp;&quot;If you think about what the president is doing for the State of Israel and the Jewish community in general, he's the least anti-Semitic person that I know... There are mezuzahs in the West Wing – it's not just Jared's office... Trump's comments [on the Charlottesville protests], he probably meant to say that there are 'bad people' on both sides, and then he said something like there are quite a few fine people on both sides, and that got him into a lot of hot water... I think he gaffed in Charlottesville.&quot; [Video]&nbsp;  -- The Mooch:&nbsp;Trump &quot;thinks he can beat Netanyahu in an election for prime minister. I know he believes that.&quot; Added that Trump told him in a&nbsp;phone call in November, 'You tell Bibi that I am coming to Israel, I'm going to beat him to be prime minister. I am very popular over there, Anthony.'  &quot;Roseanne Barr Talks Donald Trump, Says She Wants to Run for Prime Minister of Israel&quot; by&nbsp;Kathy Campbell:&nbsp;&quot;Barr, who has been to Israel three times, told interviewer&nbsp;Dana Weiss, “I want to move to Israel and run for prime minister, I do. In 2012, I said I was gonna run for president of the United States and prime minister of Israel, a twofer. I do have that fantasy. If God calls me, I’ll go, of course.” “I still have this fantasy of being an old Jewish lady living in the Jewish homeland, so someday I will do it,” added the star... “I want to buy a farm there, maybe bring my family.”&quot;&nbsp;[USMagazine]&nbsp;  Roseanne on Natalie Portman:&nbsp;“I asked a lot of Israeli friends what they thought, and they said, ‘Oh I wish she would have said it in Israel.’ Because Israel is a country where dissent is allowed, and to go out of your country and say something like that, it's not the bravest way of doing it. Also, I think it plays&nbsp;into the hands of the BDS movement. You know, they are thanking her today. But, whatever, we have to figure out a way to talk to each other and stand together... We have to be able to talk to the young people in America because they’re way off, they’re way out there. We have to figure out a way to reach them instead of turning them off... I would make her a lovely meal, and then I would talk to her about Jewish history and Torah because I think&nbsp;those are the things that bring people back and wake people up.” [Video; JPost]  NYTIMES AD DEPT:&nbsp;Rabbi Shmuley Boteach's&nbsp;World Values Network ran a full-page ad in the&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;on Saturday calling Portman a &quot;hypocrite&quot; for criticizing Israel.&nbsp;Boteach emails&nbsp;“Our full-page NYT ad holding Natalie Portman to account for her false charge of Israeli atrocities generated a massive response, both pro and con. Those who agree with her&nbsp;excoriated us for pointing out her hypocrisy.

He still smiles, his eyes crinkling, when he recalls the medals he’d won for the 400-meter dash. “I’m fast, and I love running,” he said from his bed in a sparse room in Jabalya’s refugee camp, as friends and family held vigil. “My hope was to travel to the West Bank and to compete in international games.&quot;&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  HAPPENING TODAY --&nbsp;The Charles Bronfman Prize is expected to hold its annual award ceremony in New York, honoring David Lubell, founder of Welcoming America, for helping immigrants coming into the U.S. feel welcomed&nbsp;in 190 communities across the nation. The Charles Bronfman Prize is an annual award of $100,000 presented to humanitarians under 50 who have significantly improved the world. The prize was created by Charles Bronfman’s children as a surprise for his 70th birthday back in 2004.&nbsp;  Bronfman, co-founder of Taglit-Birthright Israel, tells JI's&nbsp;Jacob Kornbluh...&nbsp;“Immigrants have made this country great. If we are an outreaching society, we must welcome those who come to our shores. I know that my own grandparents came to Canada in the 1890s, and there was a Jewish organization at that time called the Jewish Colonization Association, which bought a lot of land in western Canada for 2-5 dollars an acre. They saved that land for the Jewish people when they immigrated to Canada, and look at Canada today, and the Jewish community today. It's great.”  Bronfman on Israel-Diaspora relations:&nbsp;&quot;I think it's vital to the Jewish future that these two great societies have empathy for each other. Really, we are one people. It's not just a campaign slogan. And the day we forget it, we're in terrible trouble. I think that there has to be some accommodation on both sides. The diaspora is not going to do legislation in Israel, but at the same time, I think we have a right and a responsibility to say, 'Look, this might be very good for your country, but it's going to be very difficult for the Jews in America, or Jews in Russia etc.' Yes, we do not vote in Israel, but we are Jews&nbsp;and we are one Jewish people, and our view must be taken into account.&quot; [JewishInsider]  PROFILE -- &quot;Meet the pro-Trump PR Guy at the Center of the Mueller Probe — And Everything Else&quot; by Ben Schreckinger:&nbsp;&quot;[Ronn] Torossian’s numerous other ties to Trumpworld span the professional, the political and the personal. He sends his children to the same New York private school that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s children attended before the family decamped for Washington.

Trump’s longest-serving political adviser, the dirty trickster Roger Stone, has done work with Torossian, too, and once delivered a speech at 5W’s offices.

An Ancient Sect, A Brazen Theft And The Hunt To Bring The Manuscripts Home&quot; by Daniel Estrin:&nbsp;&quot;Before dawn on March 21, 1995, someone broke into a synagogue in the Palestinian city of Nablus. The thief — maybe it was a band of thieves — crossed the carpeted sanctuary, pulled back a heavy velvet curtain, and opened a carved wooden ark. Inside were two handwritten copies of the Torah, the Five Books of Moses. One was a sheepskin scroll written around 1360 and kept in a slender copper case. The other was a codex, a thick book, probably from the 15th century and bound in a maroon leather cover...&quot;  &quot;They were perhaps the most ancient Torahs stolen in the Holy Land since the Crusaders pillaged Jerusalem. And they belonged not to Jews but to the Samaritans, one of the world's oldest and tiniest religious sects...&nbsp;Benny [Tsedaka] believes the community did not wish to revisit Palestinians' potential involvement in the theft, which could threaten the Samaritans' delicate relations with their neighbors. The high priest says he was not willing to lose ownership of the Torah scroll by allowing a museum to purchase it. And community members were clearly uncomfortable investigating prominent Samaritans who may have helped orchestrate the theft. Whatever the reason, the Samaritans sacrificed their chance to recover the very Scriptures their ancestors had protected for centuries.&quot; [NPR]  &quot;Is Germany Capable of Protecting Its Jews?&quot; by&nbsp;James Kirchick:&nbsp;&quot;Completely sealing off the continent’s borders is neither sensible nor humane.

        "text":["<p>The airstrikes attributed to Israel deep inside Syria, aimed at weapons shipments to Hezbollah or at Iranian bases and missile stocks, and the launching of an Iranian drone into Israel have been nothing but war games, with their boundaries set in advance. This is a cat-and-mouse game played by Iran and Israel.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to imagine a scenario in which total war erupts between Iran and Israel. Such a war, if it broke out, would sow devastation and exact an intolerable toll in human lives.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Donald Trump is about to put Israel in immediate danger | Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>It doesn’t seem likely that the ayatollahs in Tehran and their counterparts in Jerusalem are unaware of these destructive implications. Such a war could draw in other countries in the region and require the intervention of the big powers to stop the destruction. Therefore, the scuffle between Iran and Israel must be viewed as war games that serve the purposes of both sides. Israel and Iran need each other because each fulfills the other's goals.</p> \n<p>Iran needs Israel in order to expand its sphere of influence across the Arab countries in the region, because as long as Israel maintains its occupation in Palestine, Iran can keep feeding the Arab world declarations about the Little Satan and the Zionist entity that must be annihilated. It well knows the intensity of anti-Israel sentiment in the Arab world.</p> \n<p>Thus Tehran, without much effort, can show people in these countries that their leaders are incompetent. Iran continues to gain; it can send out its long tentacles and further entrench its influence in the Arab world.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;From doomsday to delay: 5 scenarios ahead of Trump’s decision on the Iran nuclear deal&nbsp;■&nbsp;Explained:&nbsp;Where Israel’s leaders stand on the Iran nuclear deal&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Iran isn’t doing anything new. It learned these games from Arab leaders who have used the Palestinian issue to block any demand for freedom by their citizens. The Palestinian problem has helped perpetuate the rule of Arab tyrants.</p> \n<p>Israel also needs Iran. Just as Iran calls Israel the Little Satan (compared to the great American one), Israel also portrays Iran as the devil incarnate.</p> \n<p>Portraying Iran as the Great Satan fits the way some Arab leaders perceive the danger of the ayatollahs trying to undermine their regimes. This has also led to the prevailing view on the Israeli right that seeks a regional peace agreement that includes “moderate Sunni states” as defined by Israel. The big Iranian devil serves the interests of Israel’s right, letting it push aside dealing with the Palestinian problem, portraying it as less pressing. Israel can claim that the conflict with the Palestinians isn’t the main issue needing resolution on the road to establishing a new order in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Thus there’s some mutual back-scratching in these war games. Iran can continue to entrench its influence in the Arab world and Israel can continue to occupy Palestine unhampered and without international pressure to end the occupation. This in a nutshell is all there is to the game of conflict theory guiding Iran and Israel. The problem is that sometimes war games get out of control.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When the European Union issued its famous guidelines in 2013, which prohibited grants, prizes and funding from the EU to the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, it was hailed by many as a potential game-changer in the over 100 year-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli political analysts, from left to right, saw the guidelines as the first actual step against Israel’s occupation to be taken by a major international power.</p> \n<p>Haaretz’s diplomatic correspondent Barak Ravid wrote at the time that that it was the &quot;biggest scoop&quot; he had ever had. The prominent Israeli commentator, Dan Margalit,&nbsp;commented, &quot;Make no mistake, this is an important document. Not because of its content...Its importance steems from its function as a dangerous stepping stone for further boycotts.&quot;</p> \n<p>Senior Israeli government officials described the new guidelines as an &quot;earthquake&quot; and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was even quoted in the Israeli press as saying that Israel’s failure to stop the EU from issuing the guidelines represented the biggest failure he had encountered in 30 years of dealing with diplomatic and security issues.</p> \n<p>Palestinian commentators, from the PA to Hamas, were generally supportive too of the guidelines, even if many saw them as coming too late and consisting of too little to actually roll back Israel’s occupation.</p> \n<p>Today, it is clear that the earth did not shake in Israel and none of the predicted tsunamis arrived.</p> \n<p>One year later, Israel signed the Horizon 2020 research agreement (albeit with a face-saving&nbsp;clause stating that Israel did not recognize the EU clause stipulating that the occupied territories were not part of Israel). Later in 2014, Israel agreed to set up different production lines for those chickens raised in the settlements and within the Green Line, after the European Commission implemented a policy of non-recognition of Israeli veterinary supervision beyond the Green Line.</p> \n<p>In 2015, after several years of deliberation and hesitation, the EU decided, despite protests from some member states, to start labelling settlement products.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu responded by calling the labels &quot;heinous&quot; – a term normally reserved for terror attacks in the political lexicon in Israel. The U.S.-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, which normally combats anti-Semitism, ranked the EU’s labelling of settlement products as the third worst outbreak of anti-Semitism and anti-Israelism in the world that year, higher than Palestinian incitement and the threat from Iran.</p> \n<p>By 2016, 18 out of 28 EU members had issued business advisories warning businesses of the legal and financial consequences involved in doing business with entities linked to Israel’s occupation.</p> \n<p>Israel’s government itself seems to have decided quiet compliance is its best strategy. Just recently, in late 2017, Israel signed the ‘ENI CBC Med agreement’ for cross-border cooperation in the Mediterranean basin, which excluded Israeli projects that originate beyond the Green Line. Except for very minor protests from a maverick politician and two settler groups, no one in Israel or Europe took much notice of that tacit acceptance.</p> \n<p>That in itself is bad news for the EU’s differentiation strategy, as it needs overt political confrontation to serve its purpose of putting pressure on Israel to end its occupation. But there is limited appetite and also real opposition from governments and major political parties in some EU member states to confront Israel, and Federica Mogherini, the current High Representative of the EU’s foreign policy, is also widely seen as being against further differentiation measures against Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From a purely normative perspective, the differentiation strategy has been very successful. Many other actors in international politics – from the United Nations Security Council (in Resolution 2334), to the Chinese government, to the leading human rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, to American liberal Zionist groups – have all expressed support for the EU’s differentiation strategy or have implemented it themselves.</p> \n<p>In addition, and probably encouraged by the EU’s more formal differentiation, there seemed in 2016–2017 to be a growing trend of what might be called more &quot;grassroots differentiation,&quot; where the PA, civil society organizations and other activists involved were trying to get organizations like FIFA and companies like Airbnb, PayPal, Hewlett Packard and others to suspend their activities with Israeli entities beyond the Green Line.</p> \n<p>Again, the logic behind these measures is to create political confrontations by urging these actors to uphold what the activists perceive to be the internal regulations already mandated by those organizations and companies themselves. This type of grassroots differentiation largely bypasses political establishments and can be exercised through social media and email campaigns by activists outside the Israel-Palestine region.</p> \n<p>The differentiation strategy has worked in many aspects and Israel has indeed caved in and accepted several differentiation measures by the EU, but these have changed very little on the ground. This, of course, raises questions about the value of normative power and of having the ability to create international consensus around these kinds of issues.</p> \n<p>It is worth remembering that opposition to Israel’s settlements has been a consistent EU policy since 1977, when what was then called the EC, first started to condemn them. Despite the fact that opposition to Israel’s settlements probably is the most consensus-oriented issue of all in international politics, the settlements have grown exponentially over the decades alongside the opposition to them.</p> \n<p>This has led leading analysts, like Nathan Thrall of the International Crisis Group, to argue that differentiation measures that only focus on settlements, and not the Israeli state behind them, are a distraction. They have become a substitute for real pressure, they've become measures that actually help the Israeli government and prolong the occupation, by their implicit assurance that only the settlements - and not the government that creates them - will suffer consequences for their repeated violations of international law.</p> \n<p>Thrall then, incorrectly, states that supporters of differentiation reject penalizing Israeli state entities, like Israeli financial institutions, that help and profit from the settlements. But that is exactly what the leading EU think tank, the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), has called for since it first started to publish reports on differentiation in 2015.</p> \n<p>Israeli, Palestinian and some U.S. officials, have, for a number of different reasons, continuously tried to connect the EU’s differentiation strategy to the BDS movement, claims which have almost always been repudiated by both EU officials and spokespersons for the BDS movement.</p> \n<p>But those repudiations haven’t always been so resonant: Today, 24 U.S. states have enacted legislation against boycotts of Israel, including not just the internationally-recognized Israel within the 1967 borders, but also against what they call &quot;Israeli-controlled territories,&quot; another term for the illegal settlements.</p> \n<p>Of course, the idea that there is no difference between targeted sanctions of the settlements and the entirety of Israel, and that both constitute an &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; act victimizing the Jewish state, is precisely the line taken by the Israeli government.</p> \n<p>As Israel has struggled for five decades now to erase the Green Line, the EU has likewise struggled for almost the same period to reaffirm the Green Line as the border, with some modifications, between Israel and what it hopes will one day be a Palestinian state.</p> \n<p>This has been mostly a verbal commitment, with the exceptions of some of the differentiation measures mentioned above and the billions of euros in aid to the Palestinians over the years.</p> \n<p>In his first major interview&nbsp;with the Israeli press, the new EU ambassador to Israel, Emanuele Giaufret, was asked whether the EU was planning &quot;more steps in the future against settlement building&quot;: he answered, &quot;No.&quot;</p> \n<p>That, of course, reinforces the perception that the EU’s commitment to end Israel’s occupation and create a Palestinian state will continue to be verbal rather than practical.</p> \n<p>It is not that the EU lacks practical tools vis-&agrave;-vis Israel. The EU’s economy (in nominal GDP) is more than 50 times bigger than Israel’s, but the EU has chosen not to use its economic leverage against Israel.</p> \n<p>This is probably mostly because of American opposition, rather than because of the legacy from the Holocaust, internal division or pro-Israel lobbying. The EU is unwilling to stray too far out of the lines of U.S. Mideast policy. If a U.S. president – be it Obama, Trump or anyone else – would have used all its leverage to force Israel to end the occupation, the EU would actively assist in such a process.</p> \n<p>But the EU can’t lead the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in place of the U.S.</p> \n<p>With some relatively minor exceptions, the historical record clearly shows that the EC/EU played at best a marginal role, if indeed it was present at all, in the series of important peace negotiations through the years: the 1978-1979 Camp David Accords, the 1993-95 Oslo Agreements, the 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty, the 2000 Camp David Summit, the 2003 Road map, the 2007 Annapolis conference and the 2013-2014 Obama-Kerry negotiations. There is nothing suggesting that this pattern will change in the Trump era, even if his much-expected peace plan won’t lead anywhere. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>A final EU measure on the conflict that might have repercussions – one that falls somewhere between the verbal and the practical - is recognition of the State of Palestine, even before a final status agreement is reached. Some analysts, such as David Makovsky in a recent Haaretz op-ed, contend&nbsp;&quot;a big wave of European countries&quot; will recognize Palestine in 2018. My own diplomatic sources in Europe tell me that things are indeed moving, but it will be more like a small wave of about five European countries may together recognize Palestine, if France takes the lead, but it is not yet certain to happen.</p> \n<p>Since Sweden recognized Palestine in 2014 – a move which changed the political climate more in Sweden than in Palestine, with bitter divisions in the Swedish Parliament, a harsh Israeli pushback campaign and massive online hate against Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr&ouml;m &nbsp;- it has been rumored many times that other European countries were about to follow.</p> \n<p>So far it has not happened, but even if it would, the critical question plaguing the EU for 50 years will still be there, namely: What commitment and capability does Europe really have to help resolve the conflict, end the occupation and create a Palestinian state?</p> \n<p>With an EU in relative decline and with the rise of various right-wing, nationalist or populist governments and parties in Europe, many of whom are pro-Israeli and anti-Muslim, it seems that the EU’s commitment and capability to help resolve the conflict is, in fact, far less than it has been – and way below Palestinian &nbsp;expectations.</p> \n<p>Anders Persson is a postdoctorate researcher at the Centre for European Politics at the University of Copenhagen. This op-ed is based on research from his recent study EU differentiation as a case of &quot;Normative Power Europe&quot; (NPE) in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, published in the Journal of European Integration.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A favorite joke among the Polish-Moroccan section of my family is the one about the Polish mother who made aliyah in 1938, and never forgave herself for having missed out on the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Of course, if you’re not aware of the way Polish mothers have long served as the butt of a thousand jokes in Israeli comedy, for their fabled love of suffering and being curators of grievances, you might find that joke offensive. But being of Polish roots and the grandson of Holocaust survivors, I get to make it.</p> \n<p>I’ve been thinking about that joke a lot this past week – ever since the furor over Poland’s new Holocaust revision law broke out last Saturday. Because the Polish insistence that no one use the term “Polish death camps” is understandable. After all, the camps were built and operated on the orders of the German Third Reich, and millions of Poles suffered and died in them. So it makes sense they should be called “German death camps.”</p> \n<p>What doesn’t make sense is passing a law that prohibits calling the camps “Polish” or even suggesting that the Polish nation was in any way complicit with Nazi crimes. History is not written in law books, and the way to commemorate the victims of the Nazis cannot be through limiting freedom of speech and historical research. All that should be common sense. But the Poles have a very conflicted attitude toward the camps, especially Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>You may not be allowed to say that Auschwitz was a “Polish camp,” but Auschwitz is very much Poland’s. As you drive there on the road from Krak&oacute;w, signs point you toward the “State Museum” and you are left in no doubt that this is where the Polish people commemorate their national calamity. For non-Poles, and especially for Jews, there can be a rather unnerving feeling upon reaching Auschwitz – of competing narratives.</p> \n<p>I saw those twin narratives on clear display three years ago when I reported on the 70th anniversary of the camp’s liberation. The event, which drew a great deal of international attention, was jointly organized by the Polish government and World Jewish Congress. Guests of honor were the survivors, and they arrived in two very separate groups. The Polish survivors sat to one side, while the Jews were on the opposite side of the aisle. They barely mingled. The reunions of these elderly men and women who had been there took place the previous night, in different hotels. Each group was serving a different purpose of memory – of the Polish nation and the Jewish people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their experiences of the camp had been different as well. Actually, they had been at two different camps.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While most of the Poles had been prisoners in Auschwitz I (the konzentrationslager), relatively few Jewish prisoners spent much time there. Most of them had arrived at Vernichtungslager Birkenau, the extermination camp a mile down the track. And while dozens of prisoners were murdered daily at Auschwitz I, it was Birkenau where over a million Jews were brought from across Europe in cattle cars, for industrial slaughter in the massive gas chambers. And yes, Poles were murdered there as well, as were groups of Roma and Soviet prisoners of wars. But the fact is that for a Polish Jew, passing herself off as a Catholic prisoner would greatly increase her chances of survival (men’s chances of doing so were, of course, very slim due to the strip searches).</p> \n<p>Auschwitz was a killing factory for non-Jewish Poles as well – some 150,000 perished there – but the scale, the survival rates and conditions were still different. The memorial events could be held separately at Auschwitz I and Birkenau, but they are not and that is a good thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is only one Auschwitz, and you can understand the frustration of many Poles that, around the world, it is a name associated only with the Holocaust of the Jews and not a symbol of Polish suffering. That frustration goes some way to explaining why the Poles are so sensitive to any suggestion that they were somehow perpetrators: Not only has their terrible national tragedy, which befell them on their own soil, been overshadowed by the Jewish tragedy, they even get some of the blame.</p> \n<p>As children of the victims, we should be sensitive to Holocaust-blaming. Ask any survivor who settled in Israel immediately after its independence and they will tell you that during that Spartan period, when the Jews were finally fighting in their own army and ensuring their survival themselves, they were made to feel guilty for having “gone like sheep to the slaughter.” Holocaust commemoration then focused on the ghetto rebellions, the small bands of young men and women who had fought the Nazis, rather than on the multitudes in the killing pits and death camps. Survivors still of school age were often bullied and teased for being “soaps.”</p> \n<p>It was only after the Eichmann trial in 1961, when camp survivors took the stand to relate in public the stories of their deportation, lives and near-deaths in the camps, that they began receiving the respect they deserved.</p> \n<p>And of course, Holocaust-blaming and Holocaust guilt is a political tool, utilized by all of Israel’s leaders. None as cynically as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not only tried throughout his career to liken Israel’s current-day enemies to the Nazis, but has also played fast and loose with historical facts, claiming that Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini – the father of Palestinian nationalism, and without doubt a rabid anti-Semite and admirer of Hitler – was the original author of the Final Solution.</p> \n<p>But Holocaust-blaming is a double-edged sword. The Shoah has become such a potent and universal symbol of human cruelty and suffering that it is being turned back on the descendants of its victims. There should be no justification for comparing current-day Israel and its policies to those of the Nazis. But when you use a symbol in such a careless and cynical way, these comparisons become almost inevitable. Some people will always compare – that’s what symbols are for.</p> \n<p>The new Polish law is fundamentally wrong. We should not be deterred from telling the historical truth that there were many cases in which Poles killed their Jewish neighbors before the Germans got to them, and that in some places after the war, pogroms broke out as the Jews tried to return to what had once been home. But Polish suffering must have its space in the collective Holocaust memory as well. And Jewish life, not only death, should be celebrated in the thousand-year historical memory of what was one of the largest and most successful Jewish communities of the Diaspora. Poland was so much more for the Jews than just a massive graveyard.</p> \n<p>Holocaust commemoration and education, in Western countries at least, has been a phenomenal success. But in transforming the Holocaust into the greatest example of genocide and the most profound lesson on the threat of dehumanization, we Jews have by necessity lost some control of the narrative. We may not always feel comfortable with some of messages being added onto the memorial events and that we have been pushed slightly aside in favor of other victims as well. This loss of control will increase as the survivors are no longer with us. But that is a price worth paying.</p> \n<p>There is an inescapable contradiction in our desire for the whole world to treat the Holocaust as a unique symbol of suffering for all humankind, but at the same time to retain a complete monopoly on how it is to be defined and commemorated. There is a limit over how much we can have it both ways, and everyone wants some recognition for their suffering.</p> \n<p>That’s why, 73 years after its liberation, we’re still arguing with the Poles over who owns Auschwitz.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s speech at the Warsaw Uprising monument in Poland on July 6, 2017, did not pass the truth test of the American press, or its stomach. “Trump’s speech in Poland sounded like an alt-right manifesto,” said Vox in its headline, referring to the white nationalist movement. The Atlantic went with&nbsp;“The Falsehood at the Core of Trump's Warsaw Speech.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fast-forward six months and Poland’s right-wing government, rubber-stamped by Trump, has seemingly gone off the rails with attacks on the judicial system's independence, fascist marches and now an attempt to control free speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since International Holocaust Remembrance Day on January 27, Warsaw has been at the center of a firestorm over its bill that would criminalize accusing the Polish nation of Nazi crimes, including phrases like “Polish death camps” (as opposed to Nazi death camps in occupied Poland) when discussing the Holocaust&nbsp;– a controversy that makes Trump’s July speech relevant again.</p> \n<p>This isn’t the first time Poland’s nationalist Law and Justice party has tried to pass such a law. They tried in 2013 after President Barack Obama caused anger by speaking of “Polish death camps.”</p> \n<p>But this is the first time the bill’s sponsors sat in government, having come to power in 2016, and were able to pass it through both houses of Poland’s parliament. And it is also the first time that Polish nationalism has felt it has a friend in the leader of the free world. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the party’s leader, boasted that Trump’s July visit was a “new success” for Poland.</p> \n<p>Since Trump’s visit, which Polish leaders were reportedly able to secure by promising big, enthusiastic crowds, Poland’s government pursued legislation gutting the country’s independent judicial system, which prompted disciplinary action from the European Union. The nation also saw over 60,000 anti-Islam, anti-immigrant nationalists and fascists march through Warsaw to celebrate Polish Independence Day in November.</p> \n<p>Trump’s July speech in Poland had been written by Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump travel ban. It attempted to migrate Trump’s “America First” message into a rallying cry for Europeans. The U.S. president spoke in the dark and fatalist tones he had struck in his “American carnage” inauguration speech, which Miller also authored, insisting that &quot;The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.”</p> \n<p>He praised the Poles for their culture and strength, and asked them, “Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?”</p> \n<p>Trump’s Warsaw speech came after a long week of Trump attacking the press at home, with David Frum writing:&nbsp;“Sunday was “trivialize violence against the media” day for President Trump. Thursday was “fly to Warsaw and champion Western values day.”</p> \n<p>All of which makes the State Department’s response this week to Poland’s Senate passing the controversial Holocaust proposal an empty statement, one the Polish government is unlikely to heed. Trump’s State Department protested the proposal, suggesting it could hurt Poland’s ties to the United States and Israel, while noting, “We believe open debate, scholarship, and education are the best means of countering inaccurate and hurtful speech.”</p> \n<p>Trump himself embraced the Polish government’s right-wing narrative, by which the Poles were victims of the Nazis and did not play a proactive role in the slaughter of Jews: &nbsp;“A vibrant Jewish population&nbsp;– the largest in Europe&nbsp;– was reduced to almost nothing after the Nazis systematically murdered millions of Poland’s Jewish citizens, along with countless others, during that brutal occupation.”</p> \n<p>The president paid tribute to the Poles who took part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis, survivors of which joined him on stage. But he became the first U.S. president in decades not to visit the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto Revolt, which drew rebukes from Polish Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich, the president of the Jewish Community of Warsaw, Anna Chipczynska, and Leslaw Piszewski, the president of the Union of Jewish Communities of Poland. Ivanka Trump did pay a visit to memorial, however.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As the leader of both the world’s largest military and economy, Trump’s rhetoric obviously matters. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump tweeted: “Saudi Arabia should be paying the U.S. billions of dollars for its defense of them. Without us, gone!” Later he chose Saudi Arabia for his first foreign visit, and sold the Saudis hundreds of billions in weapons.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed NATO was obsolete and now Turkey, a NATO member, is in the middle of a military incursion against U.S.-backed forces in Syria. Trump claimed Japan should pay for its own defense, and Japan took a militant nationalist turn, giving a super-majority in the National Diet to a prime minister vowing to rearm the country.</p> \n<p>So, when Trump gladly basks in a jubilant reception from Polish nationalists, forgets to mention Jews in his first Holocaust Remembrance Day statement (he remembered this year), and openly echoes the Polish nationalist Holocaust narrative in Warsaw, surely there was an impact.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In response to the prospective law in Poland on mentioning involvement by the Polish people/nation/state in Nazi crimes, calls were heard last week to stop the trips by young Israelis to Poland from Knesset members such as Yakov Margi (Shas) – who even proposed “creating an alternative Israeli trip in Israel” – and Merav Michaeli (Zionist Union). Such calls also came from the public, which was comforted by dreams of harming tourism to Poland.</p> \n<p>For example, the secretary general of the Ezra religious youth movement called on its thousands of members and counselors not to participate in such trips to Poland, and sent a letter to the Polish ambassador in Israel saying: “There are limits to cynicism. Those who do not recognize and take responsibility for their actions and part in the Holocaust of the Jewish people, cannot continue ‘to enjoy’ the money of the people they harmed,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>But it is hard to avoid the feeling that trips to the main branches of the memorial enterprise for the Holocaust, which are naturally located in Poland, have a major part in the negative image of the Poles and their land; and for the fact that the historic stain the Nazis left on the land of occupied Poland not only hasn’t faded with the years, but has undergone the exact opposite process: This image has been strengthened at the expense of the identification of the capital of the Third Reich with the Nazi horrors. It is hard to discount the possibility that these trips to Poland couldn’t help but contribute to the false historical impression that the extermination camps were Polish.</p> \n<p>The law is unacceptable; it is not the role of governments to shape the memory of history by restrictive legislation. Nonetheless, it is possible to understand the Polish resentment that their country, which was occupied by the Nazis and in practice disintegrated, has become a synonym for the Nazi extermination enterprise, and for Poland becoming the geographic address for the feelings of disgust over the Nazi crimes.</p> \n<p>It is impossible to deny the large measure of historical irony in the voluntary exile to Berlin of young Israelis who are worried, justifiably of not, of the “budding fascism” in this country, while every year thousands of Israeli students crystallize their historical awareness as victims of Nazism in Poland. Just as people in Israel have been voicing criticism of the March of the Living at Auschwitz for years, the Poles can also only wonder why Israel does not hold a March of the Living on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin.</p> \n<p>It is impossible to dismiss as just a “technical” matter that three Israeli F-15s flew over Auschwitz in the famous flyover, and not over the Reichstag. Or that Israel, at the explicit request of the air force, pressured the Polish government but did not risk offending the sovereignty of Germany. We cannot ignore either that during the flyover of Auschwitz the air force showed that “in the name of the State of Israel and the Jewish people” that the Nazi decision to build the death camps in occupied Poland paid off twice: They distanced the extermination enterprise from their own land, and also the memorial enterprise.</p> \n<p>Israel, which is careful to ensure that the memory of the Holocaust has a concrete aspect, whose peak is the visit to extermination camps in Poland, cannot deny the powerful influence the in-person experiences have on the memory, which are much stronger than words – especially as time passes and the words are read out by young people from books and are not heard from the mouths of living survivors.</p> \n<p>The identification of “Auschwitz” with Poland is natural; Auschwitz was built in Poland, after all. The Polish government is making a mistake in how it tries to fight the evolution of the memory, but instead of threatening it with the cancellation of trips to Poland, Israel should see it as an appropriate opportunity to end them – and to open a new page in its attitude toward the memory of the Holocaust: To be freed from the chains of the past and instead to look forward, to the future.</p>",

Only in 1960 did it move to its present location, and every day since then has been serving food that seems like it came straight from the stories of Shalom Aleichem: chopped liver, egg salad, gizzards in sauce, roasts, calf’s tongue in mushroom sauce, leg of goose and other hits from the shtetl. The cholent recipe is also decades old; it includes tender chunks of meat, white beans, black beans and lima beans, potatoes, onions and wonderfully browned eggs.</p> \n<p>If you decide to skip the traditional meat cholent , you’ll do well to pamper yourself with one of the best home-made kishkes in town. In the winter they will deliver a pot of cholent to your home (price includes the pot). An individual order costs 89 shekels, cholent for two is 169 shekels, and so on. Only on Fridays. Kosher.</p> \n<p>54 Levinsky St., Tel Aviv. 03-5371872</p> \n<p>Old-time flavor: Keton</p> \n<p>Since the closing of the Caf&eacute; Batya restaurant, the city seemed to have suddenly lost one of the last bastions of kishke. But the veteran Kiton is still with us, and in recent years had a facelift, as though trying to make it look younger. It was redesigned launched a delivery service that operates all week long. Here you can still get a cold beet borscht, calf’s foot jelly, stuffed Polish spleen or helzel (stuffed poultry neck). The thick cholent here includes meat, barley, lots of beans, potatoes and a wonderful fatty kishke. Price for a complete cholent, 71 shekels. There are also vegetarian and vegan options.</p> \n<p>145 Dizengoff St., Tel Aviv. 03-5244679</p> \n<p>Generous portions: Hamitbahon</p> \n<p>A Frisbee’s throw away from the Carmel Market, Hamitbahon opened in 1997 and soon became a second home for many Tel Avivians longing for some kind of home-cooked food, even if wasn’t perfect. Twenty years later not much has changed. Even the prices have not really become inflated; they’ve increased only slightly. In addition to huge salads, soups and home-style meat dishes, there’s a large number of vegetarian and vegan main courses.</p> \n<p>On Shabbat, cholent is served, and you get one of the most generous portions we’ve come across. The crowded plate includes three kinds of beans (white, black and lima), lots of wheat, onions and whole soft potatoes along with a brown egg and chunks of meat. There’s also vegetarian cholent. Meat cholent costs 52 shekels and vegetarian cholent goes for 45 shekels.</p> \n<p>18 Rabbi Akiva St., Kerem Hateimanim, Tel Aviv. 03-5163689</p> \n<p>A surprise: Sabich Complete</p> \n<p>The big surprise of our round of tastings was discovered on Ibn Gvirol Street, in the least expected place. At Sabich Complete, a small snack bar serving sabich and various steaming soups, there’s a pot of cholent on a sizzling hotplate at the front of the counter every Monday and Thursday. Yom Tov, the Iraqi owner, learned the secrets of preparing cholent from a religious Jew from Bnei Brak. He improved the recipe, and since then has offered a spicy reddish cholent with lots of chunks of meat (almost too many), potatoes, beans and barley. There’s no egg, and we found no kishke either. But there may be no need for them. A surprisingly generous portion costs 35 shekels.</p> \n<p>99 Ibn Gvirol St., Tel Aviv. 03-5231810</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a loyal representative of the latest on Israel’s right wing. The right never eschewed lying and so it doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about. Even when Education Minister Naftali Bennett dared preach to Netanyahu, he was sanctimonious about it; he too knows that lying is the language of his camp. It’s in its DNA, part of its life cycle. Without it, it wouldn’t exist.</p> \n<p>After all, for the sake of the Land of Israel one is permitted to lie – and steal, too. And for the sake of other matters. And so the Israeli right never stopped lying; that’s why it finds nothing wrong with Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The Israeli right has someone to learn from; there’s nothing like the American right wing when it comes to lies. Guns everywhere are portrayed as the protection of individual rights, health insurance for everyone is considered a violation of rights, and neoliberal economic policies are said to be an example for the entire society.</p> \n<p>In Israel, too, right-wing politicians no longer make statements that don’t depend on lies. Jerusalem is united – a lie. There is no occupation – a lie. The settlements are legal – heaps and heaps of lies. The right wing’s conscience is so accustomed to lies that it can’t distinguish between lies and truth anymore.</p> \n<p>And so when Netanyahu says he doesn’t want to close Channel 10 and the next day says he does, that he’s not going to an election because of Israel Hayom and the next day he is – that’s no problem at all. True, the right wing didn’t inherit pure truth from its predecessors in government, who ruled from the time of the Nakba to the changeover from Labor to Likud. But the right has brought lying to unknown proportions. In the Israel of 2018, lying is the norm and truth is the exception.</p> \n<p>In this country it’s permissible to deceive people into believing that Rwanda is a safe place for asylum seekers and Israeli officials will take care of them there. Anyone who says this knows that it’s an utter lie, but’s what’s wrong with that? Lying is the way. Without noticing, lying has become the heart of our political culture, absolutely fine. Lying has become so much the norm that no one gets excited about it.</p> \n<p>One can lie and claim that an Iranian drone on Israel’s border is a brazen form of baiting, while routine Israeli bombing doesn’t violate anything. One can claim that the Israeli film “Foxtrot” is anti-Israeli without having seen it, because lying is allowed. One can say the Tamimi family is a terror family and call a girl who slaps an armed soldier a “terrorist,” because lying is allowed. The police commissioner can falsely accuse a teacher, Yakub Abu al-Kiyan, of being a “disgusting terrorist” linked to the Islamic State, because lying is allowed.</p> \n<p>Huge amounts of money can be transferred to the settlements because lying is permitted and necessary, and so is stealing. It can be claimed that the tunnels from Gaza are an existential threat and that Hamas endangers Israel’s existence; that we’ve left Gaza and it’s free, and that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is an anti-Semite. Of course it can, it’s all lies.</p> \n<p>The occupation, the heart and soul of the right, can’t continue without lies and theft; this is the foundation of the entire enterprise. There have been a bunch of pretexts for settlements: Rabbi Moshe Levinger’s Passover vacation at Hebron’s Park Hotel in 1968, Israel’s “work camp” at Kadum, the need to guard the antenna at Ofra, and the archaeology at Susya. Ever since, the whole settlement enterprise would collapse without its two main tools: lies and theft. What are the outposts if not theft and lies? And the settlements? Not one room in them was built without stealing and lying.</p> \n<p>And what’s the claim that the country that controls the lives of 4.5 million subjects without rights is democratic if not the mother of all lies? And equality of Israel’s Arab citizens – that’s not a lie? The High Court of Justice controls the country, there’s no increased religiosity, there’s no discrimination against the Mizrahim, all the Arabs fled in 1948 and all the wars have been wars of no choice – all lies. The right can’t do without them. Israel can’t do without them by now. So what do we want from Netanyahu?</p> \n<p>It was said of the first right-wing deputy prime minister, Simha Erlich, that it was so rare for him to tell the truth that a warning light went on when he did. Now there’s no longer a need for one.</p>",

        "text":["<p>MANILA – Millions of Filipino nationals work outside their country. It’s an important economic sector here; the money they send home constitutes 10 percent of the country’s gross national product. In some countries they work in construction, in others as cooks, while in Israel, as they well know here, “Filipina” generally describes the caregiver taking care of a frail grandparent or disabled child.</p> \n<p>This Filipina cooks and cleans, does the shopping and pushes the wheelchair for the daily outing, and also bathes her charge and takes care of bathroom needs. She works all day and is also present at night – the equivalent of at least two full-time jobs. Yet very few Israeli households employ two Filipinas. As a result, their workday almost never ends.</p> \n<p>For this work, which few Israelis would be prepared to do, she gets minimum wage (from which hundreds of shekels are deducted). And before the snide remarks about “for them it’s a lot of money,” everyone should ask himself if he would agree to do such work, under these conditions and for such a wage. Stories about Filipinas who became millionaires after five years of changing adult diapers in Holon are ridiculous exaggerations. That Filipina sends a substantial portion of her wages to her family, including children and the elderly, who have remained here. Sometimes it’s the main source of support for numerous people.</p> \n<p>She will also have to repay debts. To whom? To the broker and the employment agency that placed her. According to the Kav La’Oved organization, the brokerage fees can reach $10,000 or more, a huge sum in the Philippines. At best it will be a year until the worker pays off her debts and can send money back to her family; at worst it could be three years. According to employees’ testimony, around half of the brokerage fees, which are illegal, end up in Israeli hands. Incidentally, the increasing demand around the world for Filipina nurses has created a serious nursing shortage in the Philippines, as 70 percent of Filipina nursing school graduates end up working abroad.</p> \n<p>These employment arrangements through brokers are the force behind the expulsion of the asylum seekers in Israel. After all, their work is needed; there’s hardly a restaurant or a street corner where you won’t find an Eritrean washing dishes or sweeping. Most of us don’t want to do this “dirty work” either. This means that the thousands who will be expelled and left to their fate will undoubtedly be replaced by other foreign workers, but this time they will arrive through employment contractors who will take a fat cut.</p> \n<p>These contractors are well-connected to politicians and senior government officials. When I chaired the Knesset Committee on Foreign Workers, I was astounded by the vehement resistance to bringing workers to Israel through direct bilateral agreements. I quickly understood that interested parties wanted workers imported through brokers so they could make a fortune, and the government acceded to this.</p> \n<p>Now they are talking about bringing workers from the Philippines to replace the asylum seekers at the restaurants and hotels. But Israel doesn’t have such an agreement with the Philippines. If such workers are brought in, it would contravene the state’s commitment to the High Court of Justice to employ workers only under agreements, and would encourage exploitation.</p> \n<p>This is hypocrisy at its peak. This government, which is sowing fear of foreigners, is bringing in the most foreign workers. The more workers are brought in, the greater the number of those who will remain permanently in Israel – a completely natural process. Instead of accelerating the airlift from Manila or Beijing, the African asylum seekers should be given work permits so they can work in an orderly, supervised fashion, in accordance with all the rules. After all, they are already working and their employers are satisfied with them. I know this from conversations with hundreds of employers.</p> \n<p>So enough of all this persecution, lies and incitement. These are human beings, they work hard, their work is needed and there’s no reason to bring other foreigners to replace them and enrich brokers with more illegal income.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The city of Modi’in Ilit, a West Bank settlement with more than 60,000 residents, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jews, issued a strict “modesty protocol” to municipal employees that restrict the freedom of women in the public sphere. Several employees complained that they were required to sign forms consenting to the guidelines, but the city said the protocol was not binding. It was drafted several years ago by leading Haredi rabbis.</p> \n<p>The protocol prohibits men and women from joking around with one another and says that they should limit their conversations to work-related matters. They should not use greetings or expressions of farewell with members of the opposite sex that the guidelines consider overly casual or personal, such as “Shalom Lekha” or “Lehitra’ot. It also bars men and women from eating together. When they travel together in a van or bus, the men should sit in the front and the women behind them, although it recommends arranging for separate vehicles for men and women.</p> \n<p>Many ultra-Orthodox men refrain from all physical contact with women other than members of their immediate family. Several years ago, the High Court of Justice addressed the issue of public buses specially designated for the ultra-Orthodox public. In 2011 the court ruled that sex segregation could not be legally imposed on passengers, but they could opt voluntarily to sit separately. About four months ago, rabbis in Modi’in Ilit ordered that “at least the first four rows on a bus not be occupied by women at all, even with their husbands.”</p> \n<p>The guidelines were sent to every municipal employee, although not all employees have followed them. Sources said the fact that they were sent is an apparent violation of workplace discrimination laws, certainly in the public sector. The protocol, titled “Rules of Conduct for Workplaces,” was enclosed in envelopes along with 2018 tax forms that the employees received. Although some employees had been asked to sign the guidelines, the municipality later said that they were designed only to be brought to employees’ attention.</p> \n<p>Responding for this story, the Modi’in municipality said guidelines “have been distributed and published for many years, including by email, and do not serve as a form for signature by employees.”</p> \n<p>“In many workplaces, men and women work together,” the guidelines state. “Such a situation is liable to create serious obstacles due to the constant proximity of male and female workers.” The document calls the guidelines “the principles of maintaining distance between men and women that have been clear and simple among any Torah-observant person.”</p> \n<p>The protocol says separate offices should be allocated to men and women and when this is not possible, “they need to sit at separate desks with a considerable distance between them, and under no circumstances should they sit at one desk, and the same applies to their sitting opposite one another.”</p> \n<p>Men and women should not hand objects directly to one another and instead they should be passed to one another by being placed on the table. They should also not eat or drink together. Women, the document states, should also dress modestly, in keeping with Jewish religious law, or halakha.</p> \n<p>Sources objecting to the guidelines said the integration of ultra-Orthodox employees into the workplace is welcome but does not justify discrimination against women.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The policy of Culture Minister Miri Regev often causes friction between her and the world of culture, but this week she led the country and its official institutions overseas to the realm of the absurd.</p> \n<p>Next month the 18th annual Israeli Film Festival – a veteran and respected cultural institution – will be held in Paris. This year the festival management decided to open the event with the film “Foxtrot” by Samuel Maoz, which won the grand jury’s Silver Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in September, and was almost nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. But instead of boasting of the achievements of the film and its creator, the Israeli Embassy will boycott the event.</p> \n<p>Since the summer the culture minister has been waging a stubborn battle against the film, in which Israeli soldiers are seen killing the passengers of a car and covering the traces of their act. Regev decided that the film “harms the good name of the IDF,” and even “destroys the greatest celebration of the 20th century – the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Although Regev has no authority over Israeli embassies, the events of recent days proved that her spirit has infiltrated deep into the country’s institutions. The Israeli ambassador in Paris tried to interfere with the artistic considerations of the management of the Israeli Film Festival and to change the program. Festival director Helen Schoumann said that the embassy’s cultural attache asked her to replace “Foxtrot” with another film “because Culture Minister Miri Regev is at war with it.”</p> \n<p>Israel’s ambassador in Paris, Aliza Bin Noun, confirmed this and even recruited French Jews for the misguided battle: “I told the organizers that it’s insulting to part of the Jewish community,” she told Haaretz. “But the organizers refused to choose another film, so we won’t be coming to the opening.”</p> \n<p>Even if it participates in funding culture, the government has no business giving kashrut certificates to works it approves of, or rejecting works that criticize it. The dangerous confusion created by Regev between “culture” and “propaganda” threatens not only the continuation of high-quality Israeli work, but the country’s image as well: The headlines of the newspapers in France that are reporting on the Israeli boycott of the film festival, which is a celebration of Israeli culture, are arousing a great deal of embarrassment. In previous years, BDS supporters had come out in protest against the festival and now I think it’s very strange that this assault is coming from the Israeli government, the festival director said. No wonder that she concluded from this that “apparently this minister doesn’t like art very much.” Perhaps she should have added that the minister doesn’t like democracy very much either.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

Israel's doing it,&quot; the group wrote in a press release.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The strange message came after the Israeli film festival in Paris said it is determined to screen “Foxtrot” on opening night despite the protest by Culture Minister Miri Regev against a movie she says slanders the Israeli army.</p> \n<p>This week, Regev told Haaretz that she would not “support a festival that showcases films that slander us throughout the world and contains false content about IDF soldiers and its citizens.”</p> \n<p>The pro-BDS group latched on to Regev's statement, saying &quot;Miri Regev is conducting a war against Israeli artists [...] and she didn't even see the movie.&quot;</p> \n<p>“Foxtrot” focuses on the life of a family – two parents and their daughter – who live in Tel Aviv, while their son, a solider, is killed early in the film.</p> \n<p>Charles Enderlin, a prominent French journalist who has covered Israel for years, tweeted: &quot;There's no need for BDS, Israel's culture minister Miri Regev is not bad at boycotting.&quot;</p> \n<p>BDS Geneva, the Swiss branch of the BDS movement, responded, writing that unlike Regev, BDS &quot;doesn't boycott movies or other cultural works based on their content.&quot;</p> \n<p>'I love the movie'</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the festival's organizers said they had no intention of backing down from screening the film. “I really love the movie. I don’t see anything against Israel whatever,” the festival’s director, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Schoumann, told Haaretz on Monday. “So I won’t cancel it; of course not.”</p> \n<p>Two months ago, the culture representative at the Israeli Embassy in Paris asked Schoumann to consider changing the festival’s opener.</p> \n<p>“She asked me very tactfully,” Schoumann said. ‘She said ‘you know, maybe, it’s a movie, maybe you can use another one.’ ... And I said no. I don’t understand why she’s focusing on only one movie. You know the festival is showing around 35 movies, with documentaries, features.”</p> \n<p>Schoumann said the Israeli government had already lent its support to the festival, and no official had asked the festival to return the money. “Of course it’s political, but I don’t think it’s a legitimate demand,” she said of Regev’s comments.</p> \n<p>The festival has existed for 18 years, and in previous years boycott, divestment and sanction supporters showed up to demonstrate against it.</p> \n<p>“Foxtrot” will be shown three times during the festival, which ends March 20. The screening on opening night March 13 will be attended by director Samuel Maoz.</p> \n<p>“The damage that could be caused was prevented this time,” Maoz said, praising the festival’s management. In a Hebrew-language Facebook post Monday, Maoz wrote that Schoumann “didn’t blink despite another crazy attempt to undermine freedom of creativity,” thereby preventing the serious financial damage that such a step could have caused Israeli cinema.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Regev said she planned steps to prevent the government from supporting the festival, after she learned that “Foxtrot” would kick off the event. Israel’s ambassador to France, Aliza Bin-Noun, also said she would not take part in the opening event.</p> \n<p>In his Facebook post, Maoz said that of all the countries that invest money in helping produce Israeli films, France and Germany invest the most. He said this funding, which was crucial for the survival of Israeli cinema, was now at risk.</p> \n<p>“The Israeli film festival in Paris is an important platform for promoting and marketing Israeli art in France, and it attracts the leading distributors, investors, producers and journalists,” Maoz wrote. “France is the greatest consumer of Israeli cinema in Europe, and together with Germany is also the most generous co-producer. The [Israeli] Foreign Ministry gives the festival token support of 8,000 euros a year, and in return Israel receives several millions that our films about us use.”</p> \n<p>Maoz said the “ridiculous” Israeli culture budget needed this support “because without it our films won’t be able to get off the ground. But the damage that could have been caused was prevented this time thanks to H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Schoumann, the festival director, who withstood the pressure and didn’t compromise on her right and obligation to shape the festival’s image in a way that effectively reflects the past year’s crop.”</p> \n<p>As Maoz put it, “I assume that she decided to open with ‘Foxtrot’ because the commotion surrounding it stirs curiosity and naturally creates a good starting point . H&eacute;l&egrave;n reacted to the sabotage against her with noble determination, didn’t blink in the face of a crazy attempt to undermine freedom of creativity, and the French like her reaction and will return a lot of love to the festival and Israeli cinema.”</p> \n<p>On Monday, the French media reported on the government’s attempt to interfere with the festival, mentioning Bin-Noun’s decision to boycott the opening, Regev’s threat and the festival’s refusal to cave.</p>",

It was nice to see how they sit and talk after the film about every scene for an hour.”</p> \n<p>Next month the 18th annual Israeli Film Festival – a veteran and respected cultural institution – will be held in Paris. This year the festival management decided to open the event with “Foxtrot,” which won the grand jury’s Silver Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in September, and was almost nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. But instead of boasting of the achievements of the film and its creator, the Israeli Embassy will boycott the event.</p> \n<p>Since the summer, Culture Minister Miri Regev has been waging a stubborn battle against the film, in which Israeli soldiers are seen killing the passengers of a car and covering the traces of their act. Regev decided that the film “harms the good name of the IDF,” and even “destroys the greatest celebration of the 20th century – the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Although Regev has no authority over Israeli embassies, the events of recent days proved that her spirit has infiltrated deep into the country’s institutions.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Strange marks noticed in a prehistoric Finnish grave dating back nearly 5,000 years have been identified as the remains of a goat pelt.</p> \n<p>Based on electron microscope analysis of miraculously preserved hair, archaeologists from the University of Helsinki believe a goat skin had been laid in the grave, the Cambridge University publication Antiquity reported this week.</p> \n<p>The grave is associated with “Corded Ware” culture, which began to spread around Europe around 3200 B.C.E., ultimately reaching most of the north of the continent before disappearing around 2300 B.C.E. The distinctive style, created by impressing string or rope onto wet clay for decorative purposes, has been found from the Volga River in the east to the Rhine River in the west, and in southern Sweden and Finland.</p> \n<p>Corded Ware pottery culture evidently reached prehistoric Finland only hundreds of years after its advent, by around 2800 B.C.E. That’s also roughly the time of the earliest evidence of dairy farming there.</p> \n<p>In fact the pelt bit is in fact the oldest-known remnant of domestic animal ever found there, said co-author Krista Vajanto. However, that doesn’t mean the Finns didn’t have domestic animals earlier.</p> \n<p>“It has been difficult to prove the practice of animal husbandry, since in the acidic Finnish soil unburnt bone is preserved only for about a thousand years,” observes the team: Finland, therefore, has very little bone preserved from the Stone Age.</p> \n<p>So did the ancient Finns also husband the sheep and cow, or some other ungulate? Because of the paucity of remains, &quot;aside from the goat in question, we do not know,&quot; explains coauthor Marja Ahola. The oldest domestic animal bones found in Finland date to the late Stone Age, around 2000 B.C.E. – many, many thousands of years after animal domestication began far to the south.</p> \n<p>Genetic analysis indicates that the goat was first domesticated from the bezoar ibex in central Iran around 11,000 years ago, though it seems those first flocks of somewhat tamed beasts have gone extinct.</p> \n<p>A second significant hub of domestication was apparently located in eastern Anatolia, Turkey, at around the same time – around 10,500 years ago. The practice apparently extended over centuries to the Zagros Mountains, a vast range along Iran’s western border that spreads into Turkey and Iraq.</p> \n<p>In other words, going by the hair in the grave, it took around 5,000 years for goat domestication to reach Neolithic Finland – it may have arrived sooner, of course, but we just haven’t found the evidence.</p> \n<p>With the arrival of distinctive Corded Ware techniques, the ancient Finns also transited from reliance mainly on hunting and fishing marine life to dairy farming, despite being snowed in for at least four months of the year, according to evidence presented in 2014.</p> \n<p>Analyzing residue on clay pot fragments from around circa 3900 B.C.E., 3300 B.C.E. and 2500 B.C.E. showed the presence of milk fats on the most recent pieces. So, evidently Stone Age Finns were foddering and protecting domesticated animals, including the goat.</p> \n<p>Hair today, gone tomorrow</p> \n<p>Why anybody would choose to live in such harsh climatic conditions is a good question, but the choice of goats for milk, meat and fur makes sense.</p> \n<p>Sheep are frail and not prone to prolific procreation. They are vulnerable to disease and environmental conditions. Goats are a hardy bunch, breeding wildly and thriving everywhere from snowy mountain scarps to savannah treetops. For these reasons, goats were the domestic animal of choice in the Middle East for thousands of years, with only the Canaanites living in the rich city of Hazor venturing beyond the goat to farm sheep – from which they made fine wool that they shipped internationally (by boat).</p> \n<p>As for the discovery of the ancient goat fur in Finland, hair usually lasts longer than soft tissues, being made of a tough protein. But typically a year or two after burial, it will break down as well. Under sterile or otherwise special conditions or preservation, it can last for millennia, though, as we have seen from exceptional mummies in South America and North Africa.</p> \n<p>In this case, the hair was found in a grave in Kauhava, western Finland. In fact, the grave, which contained sherds of a single Corded Ware vessel, Ahola says, was found in the 1930s. The grave and its perimeter were encircled by a layer of dark soil resembling the dimensions of an animal skin. Now the analysis indicates that a goat pelt had been placed with the body.</p> \n<p>Corded Ware pottery has been found chiefly in the context of burials, so the goat hair is believed to be from the coat of an animal buried on or under a person. The identification of the type of animal was done by scanning electron microscopy. Different animal hairs look profoundly different at that resolution.</p> \n<p>The ancient goat hair was definitely domestic type, Ahola explains: &quot;The qualities we noted in the thicker ancient hairs (so-called ancient intermediate/guard hairs) – e.g., rounded/crenated tile-like scales and a biconcave or dumbbell-shaped cross-section – combined with the cornet-like structure of the thinner hairs of the material (so-called fine hairs), match only the domestic goat,&quot; she told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>They didn't find enough material, only 21 fibers, to be able to tell how close this Finnish goat was to the original ibex, Ahola explains.</p> \n<p>Archaeologists have also found objects made of domestic animal bones and pottery that might have been used for storing and drinking milk in graves from the Corded Ware period in Finland. No other Corded Ware graves in Europe have had pelts from goats or any other animal, says co-author Marja Ahola.</p> \n<p>One reason Finland’s archaeologists always thought the Corded Ware people practiced animal husbandry is that they often lived in meadow environments. Then there were the milk fat residues in Corded Ware pottery.</p> \n<p>Bones may decay fast in acid ground, but it seems that residue adsorbed onto clay can last a very long time.</p> \n<p>Analysis of fat residue was even used to show that prehistoric hominins were eating elephants in Revadim, Israel, half a million years ago. In this case, the fat residue was detected on stone tools because somebody wanted to build a gas station and the Israel Antiquities Authority did a salvage excavation – as it always does when builders want to break fresh ground. People were also shown to have cooked plants in clay pots in Libya 10,000 years ago, again based on residue found on the clay fragments.</p>",

She is being elevated after Pompeo was tapped to replace U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who was abruptly fired Tuesday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Haspel is a controversial figure, best known for her role in running CIA “black sites” during George W. Bush's presidency - including one in Thailand codenamed “Cat’s Eye,”&nbsp;where she later ordered the destruction of all documents related to the site.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;New York Times reported&nbsp;in February 2017 that &quot;Haspel oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting their brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand.&quot;</p> \n<p>Haspel has been an operative at the CIA since 1985&nbsp;and spent most of her career undercover. Trump himself has long been a proponent of torture, saying during the 2016 presidential campaign he would bring back torture and &quot;even worse.&quot;  She featured prominently in the 2014 U.S. Senate report looking into Bush-era “enhanced” torture practices overseas. As a result, Haspel may have a tough time being confirmed by the Senate. The CIA director must be confirmed by the Senate, which currently has a razor-thin, 51-49 Republican majority.  In 2013, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (California), then the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, blocked Haspel from being promoted to head of clandestine operations in the CIA over her role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes.</p> \n<p>However, fierce Trump critic and ex-National Intelligence Director James Clapper praised Haspel when she was nominated to be Pompeo’s deputy. “[Haspel] has the broad-gauged experience from both foreign and domestic assignments to serve as the right-arm for Director [Mike] Pompeo,” he said in February 2017.</p> \n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union&nbsp;was far less flattering&nbsp;on Tuesday, quickly releasing a statement protesting Haspel’s nomination.</p> \n<p>“The CIA must declassify and release every aspect of Haspel's torture record before considering the nomination,” said the ACLU, adding, ”One man held at the secret prison she ran was waterboarded 83 times, slammed against walls, sleep deprived, and locked in a coffin-like box.”</p> \n<p>The statement also questioned whether or not Haspel has the independence to run the agency, as she has been a career agent.</p> \n<p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr vowed to support her nomination, saying he is “proud” of her work.</p> \n<p>“I know Gina personally, and she has the right skill set, experience and judgment to lead one of our nation’s most critical agencies,&quot; he said to reporters.</p> \n<p>Sen. Ron Wyden (Oregon), a Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Reuters on Tuesday he opposed the nominations of both Pompeo and Haspel.</p> \n<p>“Ms. Haspel’s background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director,” Wyden said.“Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director.</p> \n<p>Senior U.S. Senator John McCain also sounded warning bells on Tuesday. “The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history,” McCain said. “Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA’s interrogation program during the confirmation process.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The&nbsp;Israel Defence Forces’ Manpower Directorate has, for now, more urgent headaches. The military has been trying to deal with a crisis in the quality of manpower for its ground forces units for the past few years, especially among the ranks of junior officers.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>As Haaretz reported in January 2017, the General Staff was presented with data showing the military’s ability to enlist combat soldiers from the entire spectrum of Israeli society has diminished, and this could lead to a gradual reduction in the quality of commanders because in the Israeli military system most officers rise up through the ranks of combat units. In recent years, the IDF has identified a continued erosion in the willingness of draftees from what the army defines as its highest quality recruits to enlist in field units.</p> \n<p>Many of the enlistees whom the army ranks as its highest quality recruits – especially those from well-off neighborhoods and towns – prefer to join technological units, whose prestige is on the rise, over the difficult and demanding service in combat units.</p> \n<p>The problem is even worse in the less sexy field units such as the tank corps, combat engineers and artillery. The emphasis the military has placed on technological roles in recent years, along with the personal benefits high-quality recruits associate with these jobs, have led more and more of the finest of Israel’s youth to ask for such positions. Most of these soldiers come from specific social groups, particularly from the middle and upper classes and from the center of the country.</p> \n<p>As part of the efforts to deal with such gaps, the IDF is now using a “predictive model” whose goal is to evaluate – with much greater accuracy – which recruits have the appropriate personal test results and rankings from the IDF’s testing process that will enable them to serve in the future as company commanders in field units – and assign them to the different units accordingly. This model is based on an analysis of the data of people who actually served as company commanders in recent years.</p> \n<p>It turns out that the different categories which the highest-level recruits belong to do not overlap. Practically, this means that of the computer geniuses who go through the selection process for offensive cyber units in the Intelligence Corps’ 8200 unit, very few – even if they have the medical profile for prestigious combat units – have the appropriate personality and other traits needed to serve as pilots in the Air Force, commandos in the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, or as commanders of a tank company. And when the military puts these young people through its selection process, it now makes sure to make it clear to them that it has reordered its priorities.</p> \n<p>Draftees who recently took the tests for both Military Intelligence and pilot training were informed by the Air Force that they could not refuse to take part in the final week of the selection process (gibush) because if they did, they would also be barred from continuing with the selection process for the intelligence units.</p> \n<p>A senior officer in the Manpower Directorate told Haaretz this was an error. The Air Force officers exceeded their authority and this directive will be canceled for the present group of recruits. But at the same time, the senior officer confirmed that the IDF does intend to implement a compulsory process in the future that would give the Air Force first priority in selecting soldiers, over Military Intelligence and other units.</p> \n<p>The source of this problem lies in the rapid growth of the cyber and technological units inside Military Intelligence. To recruit a larger number of suitable soldiers into intelligence, the Manpower Directorate canceled, for a short time, the quotas limiting the number of soldiers with high medical profiles serving in Military Intelligence. This created serious competition between the Air Force and MI for the best recruits, those who were suited for both pilot training and intelligence units.</p> \n<p>For years, the Air Force has enjoyed an exceptional privilege: The selection process for pilots is the only one for an elite unit that young men who meet the criteria are required to take part in. This requirement remains in force throughout the entire selection process until the just before the last stage, the gibush (because the IDF cannot order young people who have not yet been drafted into the military to undergo a selection process that requires physical effort).</p> \n<p>The reason for this policy is that the Air Force has proven, based on the data on previous graduates of the pilots training course, that a significant number of the graduates did not want to serve as pilots at the beginning of the selection process, and preferred to join other ultra-elite units such as Sayaret Matkal or the naval commandos.</p> \n<p>The skills needed for flying are relatively rare, almost something you are born with, and can be examined and discovered only once you are in the course and flying. By giving the Air Force priority in selecting soldiers, the possibility is greatly reduced that the Air Force will miss out on recruits who are good candidates but who did not plan on a career as a military pilot.</p> \n<p>But because the selection processes for pilot training and Military Intelligence are carried out today at the same time and the battle for the best recruits is growing fiercer, the Air Force asked this year to further strengthen its advantage by imposing sanctions on those who decline to take part in the gibush before it begins. The Manpower Directorate turned down the Air Force’s request, saying it impinged on the transparency of the process for recruits. The young people did not know in advance of the sanctions they would suffer (in other words, opting out of the pilot selection process would also end their ability to join Military Intelligence) and therefore it was decided it was not possible to change the rules in the middle of the selection process.</p> \n<p>Haaretz was told that this year’s mistake made by the Air Force would be corrected, but in the longer term the intention is still to improve the Air Force’s bargaining position with the select few. For now, pilot training is still the top priority in the IDF’s internal selection rankings, over all other elite units – including the naval commandos, Sayeret Matkal, MI and others.</p> \n<p>To compensate Military Intelligence for its lower priority, those recruits who start out in pilots training but were also accepted to prestigious MI units will be guaranteed that if they wash out of pilot training during the first year, they will be able to choose to transfer to the Intelligence Corps – and not be sent to a field unit against their will.</p> \n<p>In addition, the Manpower Directorate instructed the Air Force to examine how to move up its selection process in such a way that it will end before the selection begins for all the other elite units – and which in practice would give the Air Force the first right of refusal for those recruits it wants.</p> \n<p>This story shows how the IDF is still thinking over how to organize its selection processes. But the basic numbers have not changed: The abilities of the most sought-after recruits make them attractive to all the elite units and the IDF will have to set clear and firm rules, which will also guarantee the priority of the spearhead combat units over all other service, however important and prestigious they may be.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Forget about Brexit, the muddled election result in Germany or even Donald Trump’s ascent to power. In all those electoral upsets, traditional parties still had a role to play in the outcome and the aftermath of those results.</p> \n<p>The same cannot be said of Sunday’s parliamentary election in Italy, which may well mark the first real solo triumph for anti-establishment protest parties in a Western liberal democracy.</p> \n<p>With most of the votes accounted for, the numbers point to a hung parliament and a difficult road ahead to form a governing coalition, as all major political forces are hovering around 30 percent.</p> \n<p>But the numbers also tell us that the 5 Star Movement, the grassroots anti-establishment movement that wants Italy to leave the Eurozone, has become the country’s largest party, capturing more than 32 percent of the vote.</p> \n<p>Founded less than a decade ago by comedian Beppe Grillo to channel Italians’ disgust at their corrupt leadership and stagnant economy, the movement has surged in popularity, particularly in the underdeveloped south, thanks to pledges to clean up politics and grant stipends to all citizens. How this latter promise would be achieved, given the country’s massive public debt, remains unclear.</p> \n<p>The other, even more unexpected result of the election, is that Silvio Berlusconi, possibly the precursor of all contemporary populist politicians, has been beaten at his own game by his closest allies.</p> \n<p>The media-mogul-turned-conservative-politician, who has mounted an improbable political comeback in recent months after being forced to resign in 2011 amid a series of sex scandals and legal troubles, was widely seen as having a shot at winning the election, even though a conviction for tax fraud bars him from personally holding office until 2019.</p> \n<p>On paper, his center-right coalition did come out on top, gathering around 37 percent of the vote. But drill down into that result, and you’ll see that Berlusconi has just become a junior partner in his own coalition. His Forza Italia party has taken just 14 percent of the vote, and is now dwarfed by the League, the far-right anti-immigrant and anti-EU part led by Matteo Salvini.</p> \n<p>A close European ally of Marine Le Pen’s National Front and an enthusiastic Trump supporter, this 44-year-old media-savvy firebrand has ridden to success on the wave of Italians’ resentment over the surging arrivals of migrants and asylum seekers on the country’s shores and the perceived overly immigrant-friendly policies of the European Union and the bloc’s major powers, particularly Germany.</p> \n<p>In true Trumpian style, Salvini has accused George Soros and other progressive forces of seeking to &quot;transform Italy into a huge refugee camp&quot; and has promised to &quot;cleanse&quot; Italy of immigrants, &quot;house by house, street by street, piazza by piazza, by force if necessary.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini is already clamoring to be tapped as the next prime minister, but even though a final breakdown of seats in the Italian parliament is still pending, it appears likely that the center-right coalition will not clinch an absolute majority.</p> \n<p>If you think that may be reassuring for moderates, think again.</p> \n<p>Even if Berlusconi dumps the League, his Forza Italia forces and the incumbent center-left Democratic Party, which took just 19 percent of the vote, don’t have the numbers for a German-style grand coalition deal.</p> \n<p>One until-recently-unthinkable, yet increasingly realistic scenario, is a grand coalition of populist parties between the 5 Star Movement and the League, which would have enough seats to govern.</p> \n<p>The 5 Stars have recently been moving to the right on immigration, and they share with the League a loathing for the euro and for what they see as shady cabals of international banks and financial institutions that supposedly run the world and are damaging the country’s economy.</p> \n<p>They may also find common ground on some of the other conspiracy theories that the 5 Stars have been successfully peddling through their blogs and social media outlets: from the idea that vaccines are dangerous to the suspicion that the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States were in inside job. Many of those conspiracy theories, often spread by the movement’s founding father Grillo on his blog, have a decidedly anti-Israeli or even anti-Semitic twist.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But there are also strong differences between the two parties. The League is a more traditional far-right movement, which taps into nationalistic, ethnocentric and xenophobic ideals, while the 5 Stars are a grassroots party that has promoted online direct democracy and attracted young idealistic voters from all sides of the political spectrum.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These supporters may balk at a deal with the League, tainted by association for its longstanding alliance with Berlusconi, seen by the 5 Stars as the symbol of everything that is wrong and corrupt with Italian politics.</p> \n<p>So, it remains unclear whether Salvini can come to an agreement with the 5 Stars, whose candidate for premier is 31-year-old Luigi Di Maio, a fresh-faced college dropout who had virtually no political experience before he was chosen to be a vice-president of the lower house of parliament in the last legislature.</p> \n<p>Another last, but very unlikely, scenario, is for the center-left to agree to serve in a government with the 5 Stars, even though the head of the Democratic Party, former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, has always ruled out that possibility. But now Renzi may be on his way out as party chief following Sunday’s dismal showing at the polls, and any chance of an alliance with the 5 Stars will depend on the ensuing power struggle within the center-left.</p> \n<p>Without a clear majority, it will be up to Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to navigate through the complex negotiations that will follow in the coming weeks and eventually tap a prime minister to form a government. Mattarella may attempt to put in place a caretaker cabinet that would shepherd through the divided parliament a new electoral law – one that might ensure a more clear-cut result – before taking the country back to the polls.</p> \n<p>What appears almost certain is that for the coming months, both Italy and the entire EU will be wracked by this new source of instability and uncertainty over the bloc’s future.</p> \n<p>And that may be exactly the payoff that at least one country, which has been following these elections very closely, had been hoping for. Ahead of the vote, Italian officials and analysts had been warning for months about the danger of Russian meddling in the campaign, through fake news outlets and Kremlin-controlled trolls.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both the League and the 5 Star Movement have been cuddling up to Moscow in recent years, voicing support for its foreign policy, coming out against EU sanctions on Russia and forging strong ties with the ruling United Russia party.</p> \n<p>If one of these parties ultimately ends up in power - after this or yet another round of voting - the true winner of the Italian election may end up being someone who was never even on the ballot in the first place: one Vladimir Putin.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A few days ago I was forced to listen to the wisdom of the culture minister. I didn’t really have a choice: the bus driver turned the radio on full blast. She ripped into all the arrests and leaks from the corruption investigations. As I heard her screaming to high heaven and blaming everyone for unfairly targeting “the king,” that very same Benjamin Netanyahu she sucks up to, I suddenly recalled an incident we were both involved in, Miri Regev and myself. At the time, it was everyone’s fault but her, a victim unfairly targeted.</p> \n<p>It was July 15, 2011, on the second day of the social justice protests on Tel Aviv’s Rothschild Boulevard. Regev was only a Knesset member. She thought, maybe due to her folksy public image, that she would be welcomed. To her surprise, the opposite took place.</p> \n<p>I was there for almost a whole day since the action had started. I identified with the protest and felt part of it – maybe because I didn’t try to give a speech and didn’t come armed with cameras and microphones. Rather, I joined in the debates and sat together with everyone; maybe because of this the activists accepted me. It’s also clear that it had to do with my long-standing positions on social issues.</p> \n<p>When I saw Regev arrive, followed by a television crew of course, I moved away. I didn’t want to take part in her charade, and I especially didn’t want to be identified with the type of politics she represents. I knew she would start a scene – that’s always her goal. Her provocations are intended to maximize her publicity. Regev is an expert on the media, which in turn eats out of her hand gleefully – whether when she was the army spokeswoman during the Second Lebanon War or then during the social justice protest.</p> \n<p>In the boulevard a crowd immediately formed around her, with calls against social injustice and the government. “You’re not wanted here. You get money but don’t take care of our problems,” one of the activists told her.</p> \n<p>Regev, as is her way, didn’t come to listen but to preach. “Ludicrous, anarchists,” she yelled at them. Someone called out: “You got your photo op, now leave.” Regev replied: “Are you stupid or what?” Eventually she left in embarrassment; someone also aimed some water at her from a bottle.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Regev was quick to report to the nation. “They had dreadlocks,” she said in shock. The following day she put together a press conference. More than being upset by getting booed away, she was furious that I had stayed: “Nitzan Horowitz is received with bouquets, but when I show up I get called a fascist.”</p> \n<p>She also announced that she was going to file a complaint against me for not intervening on her behalf against the demonstrators, and for not protecting her from the drops of water. Of course she didn’t miss a chance to toss some racism into the mix: “If it were an Arab MK instead of me, he would have run to embrace him!”</p> \n<p>The incident provoked an onslaught of jokes online. The furious Regev didn’t know what to do with herself. “I am MK Miri Regev, an MK!” she yelled at Stav Shaffir on television. She didn’t skip any TV studio in her smear campaign against the protest. “They also reeked of alcohol,” she reported. “What they do in those tents is drink alcohol.”</p> \n<p>And what happened with the complaint against me? The ethics committee rejected it entirely. The decision went to the Knesset and triggered lots of smiles there.</p> \n<p>But Regev’s tactic succeeded; her star has only kept rising. She succeeded in the Likud primary, she was nominated to be a minister and is part of the prime minister’s close circle. Now her politics are used as a model for a whole group of MKs. They use the method she used to trash the social protest: brutal attack from a position of victimhood. The cry of the great Cossack. Anything to win the media’s attention, which they of course are quick to slander.</p> \n<p>And the media? It plays along. So if someone assesses that one fine day Regev may become prime minister, no one will find it preposterous.&nbsp;</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here!</p> \n<p>TOP-OP:&nbsp;Ron Lauder writes in today's New York Times... &quot;Israel’s Self-Inflicted Wounds: I am conservative and a Republican, and I have supported the Likud party since the 1980s. But the reality is that 13 million people live between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And almost half of them are Palestinian. If current trends continue, Israel will face a stark choice: Grant Palestinians full rights and cease being a Jewish state or rescind their rights and cease being a democracy. To avoid these unacceptable outcomes, the only path forward is the two-state solution. President Trump and his team are wholly committed to Middle East peace... and contrary to news media reports, senior Palestinian leaders are, they have personally told me, ready to begin direct negotiations immediately. But some Israelis and Palestinians are pushing initiatives that threaten to derail this opportunity...&quot;  &quot;The second, two-prong threat is Israel’s capitulation to religious extremists and the growing disaffection of the Jewish diaspora... The crisis is especially pronounced among the younger generation, which is predominantly secular. An increasing number of Jewish millennials — particularly in the United States — are distancing themselves from Israel because its policies contradict their values... Sometimes loyalty requires a friend to speak out and express an inconvenient truth. And the truth is that the specter of a one-state solution and the growing rift between Israel and the diaspora are endangering the future of the country I love so dearly.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  Question on our mind -- Does Lauder actually&nbsp;still believe he can broker a legacy-defining&nbsp;Middle East peace deal?&nbsp;  Flashback to April 2017 -- “According to multiple sources, Lauder is the one who has convinced Trump that ‘the ultimate deal’ between Israelis and Palestinians is achievable, a deal that has eluded each of Trump’s immediate predecessors. Lauder is said to have told the President that the Palestinians are ‘desperate’ for a deal and that ‘Israel is the problem.’” [JewishInsider]&nbsp;  Lauder honored in Jerusalem today: &quot;World Jewish Congress president Ronald Lauder and outgoing Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations executive vice chairman Malcolm Hoenlein had their names immortalized on Monday at Jerusalem’s Great Synagogue.&nbsp;Lauder and Hoenlein were honored with the dedication of walls on either side of the ark. One wall is named the “Ronald and Jo Carole Lauder Prayer for the State of Israel Wall” and the other, the “Malcolm and Frayde Hoenlein Prayer for The Security and Emergency Services Wall.” ...&nbsp;“Nothing could more reflect our commitment to Israel and the Jewish people,” Hoenlein&nbsp;said. “Ronald’s and my grandchildren will be able to come here and look at the walls proudly and say that their grandparents made a difference.” [JPost]  Jonathan Weisman writes “Anti-Semitism Is Rising. Why Aren’t American Jews Speaking Up?&nbsp;I have personally seen the anti-Semitism, in online insults, threatening voice mail messages and the occasional email that makes it through my spam filter Yet American Jewish leaders — the heads of influential, established organizations like the American Jewish Committee and the Jewish Federations of North America — have been remarkably quiet, focused instead, as they have been for decades, on Israel, not the brewing storm in our own country.” [NYTimes]&nbsp;&nbsp;  --American Jewish Committee responds on Twitter: &quot;Jonathan Weisman reveals the problem some have dealing w/ anti-Semitism. For him, it’s all about the right. That’s a big threat of course, but he fails to mention danger from the left, Nation of Islam, etc. Why? Trifocal, not monofocal, lenses are needed.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;D.C. lawmaker says recent snowfall caused by&nbsp;‘Rothschilds controlling the climate’&quot; by&nbsp;Peter Jamison&nbsp;and&nbsp;Valerie Strauss:&nbsp;&quot;D.C. Council member Trayon White Sr. (D-Ward 8) posted the video to his official Facebook page... as snow flurries were hitting the nation’s capital...&nbsp;The video... shows snowy skies while White narrates. “Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y’all better pay attention to this climate control... And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.” ... In a series of text messages, he confirmed the voice in the video is his but expressed surprise that his remarks might be construed as anti-Semitic...&nbsp;However, about four hours after The Washington Post published this story online Sunday, White sent a statement of apology via text message. “I work hard everyday to combat racism and prejudices of all kinds. I want to apologize to the Jewish Community and anyone I have offended,” he said.&quot; [WashPost]&nbsp;  Rep. Keith Ellison writes “I Have Fought Against Hate My Entire Career:&nbsp;I do not have and have never had a relationship with Mr. Farrakhan, but I have been in the same room as him I have not been in any meeting with him since then, and he and I have no communication of any kind. But as the attacks on me and my fellow Black representatives in Congress intensify, I want to be clear: this is a smear by factions on the right who want to pit the Jewish community and the Black community against each other, and distract from the hatred and bigotry on display by the president and the white supremacists who stormed Charlottesville this summer with their anti-Semitic chants and Confederate flags.” [Medium]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at the COJO of Flatbush legislative breakfast in Brooklyn: “The long-term danger for Israel is something we don’t think about enough: The young people in America do not know Israel’s story. If you look at the polling data, they don’t know what Israel has gone through and their support for Israel is declining. In every part of the country, every age group, even among young Evangelicals, support for Israel is declining. I had an hour lunch, just me and Bibi Netanyahu and this was the subject -- because it is so important We need to alert the young people to the truth.”  Schumer also boasted: “I am, baruch Hashem, the highest ranking elected Jewish official ever in America.” [Video]&nbsp;  --&nbsp;Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon presented the COJO of Flatbush Distinguished Chesed Award to fertilizer tycoon Alex Rovt.&nbsp;[Pic]&nbsp;  VIEW FROM&nbsp;RAMALLAH --&nbsp;&quot;Palestinians believe US delaying peace plan for a post-Abbas era - report&quot; by Khaled Abu Toameh:&nbsp;“They [the Americans] know that President Abbas will not accept this plan,” the&nbsp; London-based Al-Hayat newspaper quoted an unnamed senior Palestinian official as saying. “They are betting on the time factor.” The US administration is preparing for the day when there will be Palestinian leaders in the West Bank and Gaza Strip who “would not be able to reject the peace plan and would have to deal with it gradually.&quot; [ToI]  -- Abbas' spokesman&nbsp;Nabil Abu Rudeineh:&nbsp;&quot;Any suspicious political solution that does not meet the hopes and aspirations of our people for freedom and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital will not pass.&quot; [Xinhuanet]  &quot;Israeli military destroys Gaza tunnel, underground military complex&quot; by&nbsp;Oren Liebermann:&nbsp;&quot;The Israeli military destroyed a Hamas tunnel in southern Gaza on Sunday morning and struck an underground &quot;military complex&quot; in central Gaza, Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus said...&nbsp;Tensions between Israel and Gaza have remained high ever since President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December. Hamas and other Palestinian factions in Gaza have regularly called for &quot;Days of Rage,&quot; fueling wide-scale protests along the Gaza border.&quot; [CNN; Video]&nbsp;  RISING PROFILE -- “Nauert's meteoric rise takes State Department by surprise” by Matt Lee and Josh Lederman:&nbsp;“The moment that Trump canned Tillerson by tweet, [Heather] Nauert was in a Hamas-built tunnel on the border near the Gaza Strip, on a tour organized by the Israeli military to show U.S. officials the smuggling routes used by militants. Caught by surprise by the move back in Washington, Nauert cut the tour short and returned to Jerusalem to deal with the crisis. Soon, Trump also fired the undersecretary of state who publicly defended Tillerson. The president named Nauert to that suddenly vacant position, near the top of the hierarchy of American diplomacy.” [AP]&nbsp;&nbsp;  TOP TALKER -- &quot;What Hope Hicks Knows&quot; by Olivia Nuzzi:&nbsp;&quot;Over dinner in Bedminster in early August, [Hicks] told Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump that she was unhappy... Sharing her frustrations, Jared and Ivanka engaged her idea with caution; they asked her to give General John Kelly, the new chief of staff, a chance to change the West Wing for the better...&nbsp;Yet, if she waited, she probably couldn’t avoid the impression that she was leaving because of a crisis, because there was always a crisis. If she’d resigned in August, they’d have said it was owed to Charlottesville. In December? Mueller or Roy Moore. January?&nbsp;Fire and Fury.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Hicks&nbsp;met [Matthew] Hiltzik in Texas during Super Bowl XLV (in 2011), at a tailgate with Alec Baldwin, who starred in a movie Hicks had auditioned for... But Hicks made an impression on Baldwin’s then-rep, and within a few years, she was handling the Trump Organization account at Hiltzik Strategies and working closely with Ivanka Trump...&nbsp;Trump also had a different relationship with Hicks than he did with his children, who keep what the source called “ironic distance” from their father. “He knows that Ivanka has a separate agenda. Ivanka refers to him as ‘DJT’ just like the boys do, and Ivanka understands that her father is gonna be dead in ten years.” [NYMag]  Hillary Clinton says Ivanka Trump will not be the first female president -- by Jessica Kwong:&nbsp;&quot;Hillary Clinton was quick to shoot down the prospect of Ivanka Trump becoming the first woman president of the United States when asked about it on Dutch TV last week.&nbsp;“That’s not going to happen,” Clinton responded. “No,” she said, shaking her head. “No, we don’t want any more inexperienced Trumps in the White House.” ... The report that Ivanka Trump wants to follow in her father’s footsteps surfaced in Michael Wolff’s book&nbsp;Fire and Fury...&nbsp;“The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump,”&nbsp;the book&nbsp;stated.&quot; [Newsweek]  TRUMP TUMULT -- &quot;Newly Emboldened, Trump Says What He Really Feels&quot; by&nbsp;Maggie Haberman:&nbsp;“The president has his own original style, and it’s unlikely to be changed at this stage of his life,” Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, said in an interview. “But it also is conducive to bringing forward opportunities like this Korean conversation. It is not what we traditionalists would have recommended in the first place. But I have to say, when I have thought it through, and how it could play out, it could restore a political initiative to us, and could compel a conversation with countries” otherwise disinclined.&quot; [NYTimes]  &quot;Trump's firings signal hawkish turn on North Korea and Iran&quot; by Julian Borger:&nbsp;&quot;James Carafano, vice-president of the Heritage Foundation, said: “Tillerson wanted to preserve the deal but the instructions were ‘Fix it in the way I want or we walk away from the deal’, and Pompeo will do that.” Carafano said Tillerson’s firing demonstrated Trump’s increased confidence in his own instincts in foreign policy. Tillerson and other top aides told Trump his decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem would spark an eruption of unrest across the Middle East in December. The actual response was muted.&quot; [TheGuardian]  Fareed Zakaria:&nbsp;&quot;Pompeo should recognize that his job as secretary of state will be to solve problems, not produce them, and he should preserve the Iran accord and spend his time on North Korea.&quot; [WashPost]  -- “Sen. Bob Corker says he thinks Trump will pull out of Iran deal in May” by Kathryn Watson:&nbsp;&quot;The Iran deal will be another issue that's coming up in May, and right now it doesn't feel like it's going to be extended,&quot; Corker said. &quot;I think the president likely will move away from it, unless our European counterparts really come together on a framework. And it doesn't feel to me that they are. Now, as we get within two weeks of the May 12 date, that could change.&quot; Asked by Brennan if he believes the president will pull out of the deal, Corker responded, &quot;I do. I do.&quot; [CBSNews]&nbsp;&nbsp;European powers propose new Iran sanctions to meet Trump ultimatum [Reuters]  2018 WATCH -- &quot;Emanuel feigns neutrality, but teases support for Pritzker&quot; by&nbsp;Fran Spielman:&nbsp;&quot;On Thursday, [Rahm Emanuel]&nbsp;came about as close as ever to going public with his support for [J. B.] Pritzker. It happened when WGN-AM Radio’s morning host Steve Cochran asked the mayor a pointed question. “If J.B. Pritzker wins, how can I or anybody in this state feel comfortable he’s gonna work for the state and not for Mike Madigan?” Cochran said, referring to the embattled Illinois House Speaker who doubles as state Democratic Party chairman... “It’s simple. The problems are at a breaking point. And I think J.B. knows this is his one chance at political leadership and he has to leave the state better than he inherited,” the mayor said.&quot; [ChicagoSunTimes]  2020 WATCH -- &quot;Sen.

In these parts, Bibi, as he is lovingly nicknamed, is extolled as a popular hero who is persecuted by a liberal news media; a leader without peer whose peccadilloes are easily forgiven “We are all Bibi,” said Erez Madar, 33, a hairdresser in Kiryat Malachi. “Let him have a cigar.

It began in 2008, when Bisnow... cold-called entrepreneurs he admired and invited them on an all-expenses-paid trip to Utah. Bisnow shouldered the cost of the 19-strong gathering on his credit card, then repeated the trick with another get-together in Mexico, racking up $75,000 in debt. Bisnow and the others quickly coalesced a sort of “mutual aid society” for young, well-connected businessmen, which in the early days included the co-founders of Twitter and Facebook and the real-estate heiress&nbsp;Ivanka Trump.&quot;  &quot;Having finessed the art of persuading rich people to pay to join these getaways, the founders convinced their friends to help them buy an entire mountain in Utah, complete with 10,000 acres of some of the best ski terrain in the US.&nbsp;They bristle at the idea that they’re trying to build a high-altitude utopia for plutocrats, but then casually refer to a segment of their clientele as “the billionaire set” – and don’t hesitate to mention that their mountain happens to be located between towns named Eden and Paradise.&quot;&nbsp;[TheGuardian]  LongRead: &quot;Why Jewish History Is So Hard to Write&quot; by&nbsp;Adam Kirsch: &quot;What does being a Jewish historian in the twenty-first century allow one to see, and what does it obscure? These are the questions raised by two major new surveys of the subject: “A History of Judaism” (Princeton), by Martin Goodman, and “The Story of the Jews: Volume Two: Belonging, 1492-1900” (Ecco), the newest installment of a trilogy by Simon Schama. In certain obvious ways, the two books present very different approaches to the topic. Goodman, as his title declares, is interested in the history of Judaism—that is, of the religious ideas and practices that have defined Jewish life over the millennia... Rather, Schama is fascinated by figures like Dan Mendoza, a celebrity boxer in late-eighteenth-century England, and Uriah Levy, a Jewish lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, who purchased Thomas Jefferson’s house, Monticello, in 1834...&quot; [NewYorker]  &quot;Learning to Pray When Words Fail&quot; by Deborah Gastfreund Schuss: &quot;Julie&nbsp;Shulman —an Orthodox Jew deeply immersed in her faith—wanted to enhance her husband’s practice of Judaism.

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here</p> \n<p>DRIVING THE CONVO -- Defying pleas from European allies, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstate “the highest level of economic sanctions” on the Iranian regime. “The Iran deal is defective at its core,” Trump said, pointing to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's presentation of the Iranian files last week as &quot;definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.&quot; Israel hailed Trump's &quot;bold&quot; decision, which was also welcomed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain. The decision drew mixed reactions from Jewish groups.&nbsp;  Democrats, including those who opposed the deal in 2015, blasted Trump's decision, while most Republicans applauded the move. However, Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio called the decision a &quot;mistake.&quot; Former President Barack Obama blasted Trump's announcement as &quot;so misguided&quot; and &quot;a serious mistake.&quot;  Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) pointed out...&nbsp;&quot;Today is a reminder that if you live by the Presidency, you die by the Presidency. We ought to be clear about this: Donald Trump isn’t ripping up a treaty; he’s walking away from Barack Obama’s personal pledge. Two and a half years ago, President Obama made a bad deal with Iran without support from Congress, and today President Trump is pulling out of President Obama’s personal commitment, and he doesn’t need Congress’s support to do so. American foreign policy makes lasting progress when it is led by the President, approved by Congress, and presented honestly to the American people.”  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the nuclear deal in 2015, criticized Trump's decision in a&nbsp;press&nbsp;briefing:&nbsp;“There are no reports that Iran has violated the agreement. To me, the greatest worries from Iran are not right now (on) the nuclear side, but rather what they're doing in Syria. To me, the right thing today would have been to try to come up with our allies with an agreement on those issues and let the nuclear part of this continue because it's not being violated in any way...&nbsp;This is a little like replace and repeal — they had these words, they used them in the campaign, and they don’t have a real plan here. I just don't see a concrete plan emerging, and when I spoke to the Vice President, I asked him a whole lot of questions and didn't get good answers.&quot;&nbsp;[CSPAN]&nbsp;  Jewish Insider's&nbsp;Jacob Kornbluh&nbsp;spent some time on Capitol Hill yesterday and received&nbsp;reactions from several&nbsp;Senators and members of the House.&nbsp;  Sen.&nbsp;Sherrod Brown (D-OH):&nbsp;&quot;It's a wrong decision. First of all, it can spark an arms race in the Middle East where Iran is going to move towards nuclear weapons. I don't understand why our country would run counter to what our allies think about this, and how do you convince the North Koreans that Americans live by their words. Clearly, the deal has had a good impact in stopping them from getting nuclear weapons. That's good for Israel and that's good for the Middle East. Canceling that creates that kind of uncertainty that I cannot guess, but it is not good.&quot;&nbsp;  Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI):&nbsp;&quot;It may feel satisfying to those who feel that America didn't strike a tough enough deal. But the simple fact of the matter is, we are now giving Iran everything they wanted. They get their financial relief and their nuclear program soon. Israel is absolutely worse off and less safe as a result of us withdrawing from the deal.&quot;&nbsp;  Sen. Jeanne&nbsp;Shaheen (D-NH):&nbsp;&quot;I am very disappointed. I think this makes the Middle East more dangerous, not less, and I think it makes Iran become more dangerous. It could lead to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which doesn't benefit Israel or America.&quot;  Rep.&nbsp;John Faso (R-NY):&nbsp;&quot;Obviously, Iran is not a willing partner or a good partner in this deal and some changes need to be made to the deal. The thing that concerns me is that I hate to see the U.S. act without having the agreement of our allies. I'm most concerned about the safety and security of the people in Israel and I want to make sure that everything we do is done in an effective way that enhances that security.&quot;  Question:&nbsp;What's the effect&nbsp;of having President Trump as the face of the opposition&nbsp;to the Iran deal? Does it matter?&nbsp;  Menashe Shapiro, founder of the Shapiro Consulting Group:&nbsp;&quot;It’s certainly not going to help keep those on the left in the pro-Israel fold.&nbsp;The more Trump becomes the face of pro-Israel policies, the more the radical left can play the “Trump card” to silence the left of center pro-Israel Democrats Israel needs to maintain its ever-shrinking&nbsp;bipartisan support in the US.&nbsp; Even the proverbial good policies that enjoy wide-spread support - ie the majority of Americans were against the Iran deal, and moving the Embassy to Jerusalem that was a Democratic idea first proffered by a liberal George McGovern in 1972 – will come under assault because Trump has become the face of these actions.&nbsp;In the long run, it will exacerbate the left-right dichotomy when it comes to Israel support.&nbsp;That being said, it will have little effect on the midterms. The Iran deal will not determine control of the Senate.&nbsp;Not by a longshot.&quot;  NYC-based communications guru&nbsp;Stu Loeser:&nbsp;&quot;The overwhelming majority of people who oppose Trump from the left were probably for the deal or gave President Obama the benefit of the doubt. From a political perspective, this will certainly help him lock down right-of-center Jewish voters and more religiously traditional Jewish voters. These folks likely supported him in 2016, but by 2020 they might have grown wary or weary of Trump's embrace of anti-Semitic tropes and worse.&nbsp;Taking care of a sizable and pretty easily identifiable base vote that's growing in states like Florida, Michigan and Ohio two years from an election, most candidates only dream of doing that.&quot;&nbsp;  Democratic campaign consultant Hank Sheinkopf:&nbsp;&quot;Democrats who dislike the President are unlikely to change their opinions ever. Trump was simply keeping a campaign promise. The clear strategy is to prove he kept his word to those who voted for him. It’s the place where policy and politics meet. Scuttling the Iran deal is meant to show Trump as a person of honor who keeps his word and thus cannot be the villain some have painted him to be. However, foreign policy rarely moves public opinion strongly&nbsp;or decides elections.&quot;&nbsp;  -- &quot;Trump’s decision on Iran deal has implications in Florida’s U.S. Senate race&quot; by&nbsp;Alex Leary:&nbsp;&quot;Sen. Nelson in 2015 provided crucial Democratic support for the deal, blocking attempts from opponents to rip it up...&nbsp;Gov. Scott, like many Republicans, opposes the deal. On Friday, he&nbsp;wrote a letter to Trump urging him to scrap the deal, noting that Florida is home to a large Jewish population... Now that Trump&nbsp;has followed through on his past threats to kill the deal, Scott could use it against Nelson.&quot; [TampaBayTimes]&nbsp;  HOW IT PLAYED -- &quot;Behind Trump’s Termination of Iran Deal Is Risky Bet That U.S. Can ‘Break the Regime’&quot; by&nbsp;David Sanger&nbsp;and&nbsp;David Kirkpatrick:&nbsp;&quot;It was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  &quot;How Talks with North Korea Convinced Trump to Scrap the Iran Deal&quot; by Brian Bennett:&nbsp;“It’s not clear that the Art of the Deal works,” said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies... “Obviously Trump has an appetite for risk that has led him to huge successes and four bankruptcies. This is clearly another example of a hugely risky negotiating strategy that could yield extremely positive results or be a potential disaster.” [Time]  Richard Goldberg:&nbsp;&quot;Put aside the idea that Iran is going to race to the bomb now; that fear has existed for a very long time, and both Republican and Democratic administrations have agreed that they would use military action to prevent that scenario, and the Iranians know that and are therefore unlikely to provoke that response. Iran also doesn’t want to become politically isolated, and if they were to race to the bomb, they would lose the support they still have right now in Europe and elsewhere.&quot; [Vox]  Bret Stephens writes...&nbsp;&quot;A Courageous Trump Call on a Lousy Iran Deal:&nbsp;Build on political sand; get washed away by the next electoral wave. Such was the fate of the ill-judged and ill-founded J.C.P.O.A., which Donald Trump killed on Tuesday by refusing to again waive sanctions on the Islamic Republic. He was absolutely right to do so — assuming, that is, serious thought has been given to what comes next.&quot; [NYTimes]  Eli Lake writes... &quot;Trump Is Now Free to Fight for Iranian Freedom:&quot;It's ultimately up to the Iranian people to organize their next revolution, but Trump has a chance to pursue solidarity with their struggle instead of negotiating another deal with their oppressors.&quot;&nbsp;[BloombergView]  VIEW FROM JERUSALEM --&nbsp;&quot;For Netanyahu, Vindication and New Risk After Trump’s Iran Decision&quot; by&nbsp;David Halbfinger:&nbsp;&quot;For Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, President Trump’s decision on Tuesday to abandon the 2015 agreement was such a wholesale vindication that he abruptly cut short a trip to Cyprus to be in Israel when it was announced...&nbsp;Being seen as fiercely taking on Israel’s most fearsome adversary while standing shoulder to shoulder with its most critical ally can only help Mr. Netanyahu politically as he awaits a likely indictment in a sprawling corruption investigation...&nbsp;Yet... after more than a decade without a major war, the country now faces threats from almost every direction.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]&nbsp;  &quot;Syria Hit by New Strikes As Trump Cancels Iran Deal and Israel Calls High Alert&quot; by Tom O'Connor:&nbsp;&quot;Suspected&nbsp;Iranian military positions&nbsp;were hit by new strikes Tuesday shortly after Israel ordered citizens to take shelter... The official&nbsp;Syrian Arab News Agency&nbsp;reported that Israeli jets struck&nbsp;Al-Kiswa, located near eight miles south of Damascus, claiming Syrian air defenses downed two incoming missiles.&quot; [Newsweek; Reuters] &nbsp;US officials growing increasingly concerned Iran could attack Israel [CNN]&nbsp;  &quot;Former Israeli Prime Minister: Iran May Believe Trump Is Looking for War&quot; by Lena Felton:&nbsp;&quot;President Trump’s exit from the Iran deal... could send a signal to the Iranians that Trump is looking for a war. That was the assessment offered by the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, in a live interview with&nbsp;The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, at Washington’s Sixth &amp; I Historic Synagogue Tuesday evening... The decision, Barak argued, will communicate to Trump’s base that the president is willing to follow through on his promises... which is “extremely important.” Secondly, the former prime minister reasoned, Trump may have felt stymied by the lack of options, other than negotiation, to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat. Exiting the Iran deal, on the other hand, looks by comparison like a tangible action.&quot; [TheAtlantic]&nbsp;  David Horovitz writes... &quot;Trump’s Iran&nbsp;deal withdrawal: It should never have come to this:&nbsp;Iran is currently threatening that it may resume uranium enrichment and boasting that it has improved its technology so that it can enrich to higher levels than ever before — all while complying with the deal. That tells you all you need to know about the agreement. It did not require Iran to trash all of its centrifuges, and it allowed Iran to continue research and development on enrichment. Good job, negotiators. Well done.&quot; [ToI]  DRIVING THE DAY -- Netanyahu meets Putin in Moscow amid new round of Syria strikes:&nbsp;&quot;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss military coordination... “The meetings between us are always important and this one is especially so,” Netanyahu said ahead of his departure. “In light of what is currently happening in Syria, it is necessary to ensure the continued coordination” between the two militaries. Netanyahu made no mention of the overnight strikes. During the visit, Netanyahu and Putin attended a parade in Moscow commemorating the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany 73 years ago.&quot; [ToI; Video]&nbsp;  JERUSALEM EMBASSY WATCH -- The White House will host a live viewing ceremony&nbsp;for&nbsp;the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem&nbsp;on Monday morning, according to an invitation sent out by the White House Office of Public Liaison to Jewish leaders and supporters.  ALREADY IN JERUSALEM --&nbsp;Jason Greenblatt, Trump's Mideast peace envoy and a member of the presidential delegation to the opening ceremony of the embassy in Jerusalem, was spotted at the King David yesterday. [Pic]&nbsp;  Former Ambassador Daniel Shapiro writes... &quot;What everyone’s getting wrong about the U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem:&nbsp;Advocates of a two-state solution see the embassy move as a blunder by the United States that signals the death knell of prospects for peace.

But there’s been little attention paid to the regional rivalry behind them...&nbsp;Ironically, both the UAE and Qatar are US allies, with Qatar providing a base for US aircraft flying missions in the Middle East and the UAE contributing pilots and planes to the anti-ISIS coalition.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Noah Pollak, the director of the Committee for Israel, which lobbies on Middle East issues, said the allure of such a campaign is almost irresistible. “It's so low-cost yet so effective at knocking someone out of the game and embarrassing one side in a political fight,” he told BuzzFeed News. “You could spend years campaigning traditionally against someone or you could hack an email account and leak salacious details to the media. If you have no scruples, and access to hackers, the choice is obvious.” [BuzzFeed]</p> \n<p>** Good Wednesday Morning!

This involves the slaughter of a small herd of sheep at twilight – an offering to God, giving thanks for the community’s freedom from slavery in Egypt and based on the text in the Book of Exodus.</p> \n<p>The ritual takes place atop Mount Gerizim (also known as Jebel et-Tor), which is sandwiched – somewhat symbolically – between the Israeli settlement of Har Bracha and the Palestinian city of Nablus. It is on this mount the Samaritans believe God ordered their temple to be built. They believe the mountain houses the rock where Abraham was prepared to follow God’s command and sacrifice his son Isaac, the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments, where God is said to have made Adam out of dust, and where Noah’s ark came to rest.</p> \n<p>The Samaritans (“Shomronim” in Hebrew) consider themselves the descendants of the Israelites, from the ancient Kingdom of Israel in biblical times. They believe their ancestors escaped exile under the Assyrians in the eighth century B.C.E. and that they alone kept alive the traditions of the Jewish people. They claim the Kingdom of Judah, which went on to become what we know today as the Jewish people while exiled in Babylon, moved away from those original traditions.</p> \n<p>According to the British former diplomat and historian Gerard Russell in his book “Heirs to Forgotten Kingdoms,” the Samaritans “saw themselves as keeping to the letter the ancient traditions that their southern neighbors the Jews had abandoned,” and had a history of persistent conflict with them. To name but one such incident of this long-enduring “family feud,” in the year 9 C.E., the Samaritans are said to have vandalized the Jewish temple in Jerusalem, littering it with human bones.</p> \n<p>Still, Abdullah Aboud Cohen, the 23-year-old grandson of the community’s current high priest Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach, isn’t about to pull rank. “To call us the real Jews is misleading as we are all the descendants from the same people,” he says diplomatically, as the community’s de facto spokesperson. Indeed, all of his pronouncements on Samaritan history are given with a hint of caution, no doubt aware of religious sensitivities in this most incendiary of lands.</p> \n<p>During Byzantine rule some 1,500 years ago, the community dwindled and suffered from endless persecution, eventually benefiting from the conquest by Arab Muslims in 637. Over time, the community suffered from plague, persistent poverty, and socioeconomic pressure, with many moving across the Middle East to Damascus, Cairo or Northern Iraq.</p> \n<p>By the 20th century, most of the Samaritan diaspora had slowly disappeared, many having converted to Islam. (The Samaritan synagogue in Cairo was handed over to the Jewish community in 1706.) In the 1840s, faced with the threat of a pogrom in Nablus that would wipe out what was left of the community in the Holy Land, the Sephardi chief rabbi of Jerusalem, Chaim Abraham Gagin, stepped in to save the Samaritans. He declared them “a branch of the House of Israel,” and they were spared at the cost of paying a hefty fine to the city’s Muslim authorities. But by the time of the British Mandate era, the community was close to extinction.</p> \n<p>In his 1989 book “History of the Samaritans,” historian Nathan Schur wrote that the Samaritans are “probably the smallest group of people over many centuries to have retained a nationality consistently their own.” Their existence “can be likened to a tiny boat tossed about by huge waves in a hostile ocean,” he noted. Much like their forefathers, young Samaritans are trying to navigate it while getting on with their lives.</p> \n<p>The art of diplomacy</p> \n<p>If their Passover celebrations earlier this month demonstrate anything, it is that the Samaritans have mastered the art of diplomacy. The guest list for this year’s event included Davidi Ben Zion, the acting head of Samaria Regional Council, as well as Nablus Mayor Adly Yaish, who was elected as a Hamas candidate but is believed to come from a Samaritan family that converted to Islam. Palestinian Authority representatives were also invited, alongside Yesha Council of settlements representative Yigal Dilmoni and Israel Defense Forces Samaria Brigade chief Col. Gilad Amit. “The only people we get any hate from are the vegan activists,” chuckles Cohen, referring to the bloody scenes as the community’s butchers slit the sheep’s throats during the Passover ritual.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, the community is divided evenly between the Palestinian village of Kiryat Luza and the Neveh Pinhas neighborhood in Holon, a city just south of Tel Aviv where the Samaritans settled with the help of Israel’s then-President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi in 1954. It was to Holon that around 100 Samaritans, mostly the younger generation, descended from their West Bank village last month to join that community’s Israeli Independence Day celebrations.</p> \n<p>Cohen says the Samaritans in Kiryat Luza have a “ticket to the whole Holy Land,” with most possessing Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian passports. Yet these three separate citizenships hint at the identity crisis affecting the community. Some Palestinians call the Samaritans “Israelis and Zionists,” explains Cohen, who describes himself as a “Palestinian Israelite.” Likewise, he notes, some Israelis view them as “Arabs.” Most modern scholars tend to view the Samaritans as a Judaic sect.</p> \n<p>Remaining ‘neutral’</p> \n<p>Although Cohen’s mother tongue is Arabic and he studied at An-Najar National University in Nablus, he says that most Samaritans are loath to reveal their true identity to strangers or passing acquaintances. “I didn’t say it directly or bring it up openly in conversation at school or university,” he admits. Cohen’s admission is at odds with the Samaritans’ official narrative that they serve as a bridge between Jews and Arabs in the region.</p> \n<p>The Samaritans used to hold a single honorary seat in the Palestinian parliament – granted to them by then-PLO President Yasser Arafat – but are currently unrepresented as the seat was not renewed. “There wasn’t any benefit in having it,” explains Cohen, since the Samaritans try to remain “neutral” in Israeli-Palestinian matters.</p> \n<p>That’s no easy task. On the one hand they are indebted to the late King Hussein of Jordan, who allowed them to go back and forth from Holon to Nablus before 1967, and granted them freedom to practice on Mount Gerizim. Yet it was Israel that guaranteed their permanent access and presence to the mount when it occupied the West Bank after the Six-Day War in 1967.</p> \n<p>Even in everyday life, the Samaritans in Kiryat Luza are often stuck between a rock and a hard place. Cohen explains how they use the health clinic in the Har Bracha settlement and obtain their driving licenses in the large Israeli settlement of Ariel (“You can only use the Palestinian license on the one side of the border, and it’s not an international license,” he says), yet many work in Nablus.</p> \n<p>Kiryat Luza is also fairly unique for being split between the three administrative areas drawn up when the Oslo Accords were signed between Israel and the PA in 1993: Area A (under full Palestinian security and civil control); Area B (Palestinian civil control and joint security control); and Area C (full Israeli security and civil control). “As Samaritans, we wake up in Area B, worship at the Mount in Area C, and go to work in Area A,” says Samaritan scholar Benyamim Tsedaka.</p> \n<p>Army dreamers</p> \n<p>Several Samaritans explain that most young members of the community, even those living in the West Bank, want to join the Israeli army nowadays – recognizing it as being key to becoming part of Israeli society. Breeto, a young man in his twenties, laments the difficulties of being a young Samaritan as he speeds down from Mount Gerizim, along the winding roads of the West Bank for a night out in the Israeli settlement of Ariel. Breeto says Samaritan parents won’t let their children join the army out of concern that it could have serious consequences for the safety of the entire community. But he still tried to join, he says, eventually being rejected on health grounds. Breeto mumbles that you don’t need to be a warrior to work at a computer in Tel Aviv, hinting that he was “discriminated” against because he’s Samaritan. Baruch, meanwhile, says a cousin of his managed to join the army – “but everyone had to keep it secret.”</p> \n<p>For Arafat, a Palestinian Arab whose cousin sold land to the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim and whose family home sits on the border separating Kiryat Luza from Nablus, it’s the fact that the Samaritans “are not in the army” that makes them “occupied just like us.” Asked what he thinks about the Samaritans who live in Holon and serve in the Israeli military, Arafat takes another drag from his narghile pipe and considers the question. “We don’t see them and we don’t care about them,” he responds.</p> \n<p>There are other problems facing young Samaritans as well. “We want to go to university in Israel, but our Hebrew isn’t good enough when we are 18 having gone to school in Arabic,” says Breeto. “It just seems that preserving our millennia-old traditions always takes precedence over our lives today,” he adds, shouting over the pop music blaring from his car stereo on the way to Ariel.</p> \n<p>Turning point</p> \n<p>Jacov, who works as a builder in Rehovot and commutes from Kiryat Luza every day, claims the younger generation have a stronger yearning for Israel than their elders because of the internet. In the past, he says, it was harder to “compare one side to the other.”</p> \n<p>He went to school in Nablus in the 1980s, where he says “everything was better” because the Palestinians “only had Jordanian and Israeli TV.” Today, by comparison, the Palestinians watch satellite TV, where they see “all sorts of Arab channels that incite against Israel.” He yearns for a past where he used to speak to his Arab classmates about Israeli basketball, “and they would know all the players.”</p> \n<p>The two intifadas were the main turning point for the Samaritan community. “We were afraid for the safety of our children,” says Simha, 76, gazing down the hill from Kiryat Luza toward Nablus. “We were not afraid of the Palestinians, but of the everyday violence on the streets.”</p> \n<p>Every Samaritan parent knows the story of Karim Yitzhak Amram Cohen, a young Samaritan who was convicted on terrorism charges in 2003 for aiding Hamas. For Simha, moving up to Kiryat Luza was a way to distance their children from the violence during the intifadas (the first from 1987-1993; the second from 2000-2005).</p> \n<p>The intifadas were the main reason the Samaritans increasingly started selling or renting their properties in downtown Nablus, where they had been for hundreds of years, and started moving to new buildings in the gated community of Kiryat Luza, or further afield to Holon.</p> \n<p>The Ukrainian factor</p> \n<p>To complicate matters further, an increasing number of Samaritan men have begun marrying Eastern European women (particularly Ukrainians) in the past decade. They are marrying them primarily to stave off the ever-present fear of a demographic crisis in this community where the men strongly outnumber the women, particularly in Kiryat Luza.</p> \n<p>All Samaritans remember the year 1919, when only 141 Samaritans were left in the world (61 women and 80 men), recounts Tsedaka. Indeed, the Samaritan scholar refers to that figure when he speaks of a “Samaritan Holocaust” and calls on the community to remember it on Holocaust Memorial Day.</p> \n<p>Jacov is married to Gala, a Ukrainian woman who sits beside him with an unflinching smirk and dark rings under her eyes as they celebrate Independence Day at a family home in Holon, before heading back to Mount Gerizim. “Gala will receive Israeli citizenship in a few months,” Jacov says proudly. And his brother Baruch is soon off to Kherson Oblast, southern Ukraine, to collect his own Ukrainian wife, whom he met on the internet. Once married, the women will convert to the Samaritan religion.</p> \n<p>Meeting ground</p> \n<p>While some young Samaritans dream of a more prosperous future (which pushes them toward Israel), they still recognize their primary goal as preserving their community and its customs – with the promotion of Israeli-Palestinian coexistence seemingly serving that purpose.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Cohen sees Mount Gerizim as a place where both Israelis and Palestinians can meet, often for the first time. The liquor store at the entrance to Kiryat Luza is unlikely but perhaps living proof of this claim. Outside, a 4x4 screeches to a halt and out pile four young men in kippas who grab a few beers – only to be followed seconds later by two young Palestinian men, picking up a couple of bottles of Arak for the weekend.</p> \n<p>Since the only liquor store in neighboring Nablus was burned down some years ago, the Samaritans have a monopoly over the alcohol business in the area. At the end of Shabbat, when the Samaritans reopen the gate of the road zigzagging down toward Nablus, a long line of Palestinian cars can be seen waiting to restock supplies. Being the outsider sometimes has its benefits, too.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After securing its place at the 2019 Asian Cup, rising to an all-time high of 73 in the international rankings and, most important, leaving Israel far behind in 98th place, the Palestine national soccer team can be proud of its accomplishments over the past year.</p> \n<p>The first two achievements brought great honor to the top project of Palestinian Football Federation Chairman Jibril Rajoub. Indeed, everything looked rosy for the team until December – when an image was posted online showing Rajoub sitting at a table, signing documents with the Bolivian soccer coach Julio C&eacute;sar Baldivieso and Turki Al-Sheikh, president of the Sports Federation of Islamic Solidarity and the strongest figure in Arab soccer.</p> \n<p>The photo rocked Palestinian soccer and set off one of the most turbulent stories to hit the Asian soccer world in the past year: It’s a story of money, power, politics and sports that encompassed South America and the Middle East, and from Saudi Arabia to the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Abdel Nasser Barakat is responsible for much of the Palestinian national team’s success in recent years. All of its impressive accomplishments – from its performance in the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia to winning a place in next year’s finals in the United Arab Emirates, and its international ranking – revolve around Barakat, who has put together a tight squad of players while enjoying the fruits of Rajoub’s deep investment in the sport.</p> \n<p>Barakat had been a respected midfielder for El Bireh in the West Bank before, aged 25, quitting his day job as a construction worker in order to devote himself to coaching soccer. He was considered at the vanguard of local Palestinian coaches.</p> \n<p>He coached every age division of the Palestine national team over the past 14 years, and nearly all the players who worked with him describe him as an excellent coach, tough and dedicated.</p> \n<p>The devotion he commanded from Palestinian soccer fans was close to absolute. When he suspended superstars such as Ashraf Nu’man and Abdelatif Bahdari – among the greatest Palestinian players of all time – rather than getting mad at Barakat, the fans supported him. Barakat was clearly Rajoub’s man, but above all he knew his job.</p> \n<p>But after the image of Rajoub with Sheikh and Baldivieso was published, the big picture soon came into focus: Barakat was out as coach, Baldivieso was in.</p> \n<p>Julio who?</p> \n<p>Baldivieso is a well-known figure in Bolivian soccer, with an impressive history as a player and interesting history as a coach. Before signing with Rajoub and Sheikh, Baldivieso mainly coached Bolivian clubs, and the Bolivian national team for one year. As a player, he played in Argentina, Japan, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and was on the Bolivian national team in the 1994 World Cup in the United States.</p> \n<p>All that experience qualified him to coach the Palestinian national team, but by South American standards he is not considered a top coach by any means. In addition, he has been caught up in several corruption scandals. Baldivieso came to worldwide attention in 2009 when he picked a 12-year-old kid to play for Bolivia’s Club Aurora. Coincidentally or not, that boy just happened to be his son, Mauricio. Three years later, there was more drama as Baldivieso Sr. was filmed kicking his son as they returned to the locker room at halftime.</p> \n<p>A tweet from Mauricio after his father became the Palestinian coach hinted at what was to come: “Happy for the new beginning in Saudi Arabia,” he wrote, underlining his father’s ignorance about what he was getting into. Things only got worse when Mauricio – now the grand age of 21 – began to take part in the team’s practice sessions as a coach, giving orders to the players. At that point, fans lost patience.</p> \n<p>What Turki wants, Turki gets</p> \n<p>So how could all this happen? The answer is simple: money, power and everything in between. Sheikh was behind the deal. Baldivieso, it’s been claimed both in Bolivia and the coach’s inner circle, has been close to Sheikh and his family since the Bolivian’s stint playing for the Saudi soccer team Al Nassr. Sheikh, 36, a member of the Saudi royal family who also heads up the kingdom’s General Sport Authority and the Arab Football Federation, loves sports and has his finger in many sports-related pies. He was behind the bizarre deal under which nine leading players on the Saudi national soccer team were loaned out to top Spanish teams, in exchange for $1 million for each of the participating Saudi teams. He also has a hand in everything that goes on at Saudi Arabia’s four biggest soccer clubs. On top of all this, he also helps out the Egyptian soccer team Al Ahly and became the club’s honorary president.</p> \n<p>The bottom line is that Sheikh’s offer was one that Rajoub could not refuse – $1 million in direct aid to the Palestinian soccer league. But it goes beyond that: Rajoub can’t afford to turn down a Saudi offer. He needs their support on a variety of issues within the Asian Football Confederation and soccer’s world governing body FIFA, and possibly in the near future also vis-a-vis the Arab League or the United Nations. Rajoub had no choice but to swallow the increasing closeness between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which for obvious reasons he was unable to influence. In other words, Rajoub made the logical decision.</p> \n<p>The problems began when Baldivieso asked for a 40-day, midseason training camp with the national team, disturbing the rhythm of the local league. During this training camp, the team played three matches: against Algeria U23s in Algiers; a friendly against Bahrain in Manama; and an Asian Cup match against Oman in Muscat. The Palestinians didn’t do very well, and the national team’s players soon split into two camps. The pro-Baldivieso side supported the new coach since, not knowing Arabic, he could not fully appreciate the mess he was in. “All he wanted was to bring new things, things we don’t have here,” one player said. “They’re not giving him a chance,” another player said. But a veteran teammate, when asked to weigh in on the coaching skills of Baldivieso and his staff, replied, “It’s better that I not say anything.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Palestine fans launched a campaign against Baldivieso and his crew with the hashtag #goawayJulio (in Arabic), which went viral.</p> \n<p>No Palestinian fan wanted Julio Baldivieso to stay on. Rajoub knew his experiment was over and, according to sources on the team, he told the Bolivian coach he must beat Oman on March 27 if he wanted to keep his job. But the Palestinians lost, 1-0. The disappointment with the poor results was mixed with the expectation of getting into Pot 2 in the Asian Cup. That didn’t happen either, and the team was placed in Pot 3. Fans and sports reporters kept up the pressure, and on April 22 the Palestinian Football Association announced Baldivieso’s dismissal.</p> \n<p>Slightly over six months before the Asian Cup – the most important event to date for the national side, where it will face group games against Syria, Australia and Jordan – the Palestinian national team has lost its coach and the way ahead is unclear.</p> \n<p>Barakat, who would like his old job back, cannot return for now as he holds an administrative position in the Palestinian Football Association. Noureddine Ould Ali, an Algerian who was the assistant coach under Barakat, has been named acting coach. His first mission began Tuesday, when he secured a 0-0 draw in a friendly away to Iraq. The team faces Kuwait on Friday.</p> \n<p>One way or another, the Palestine national team is on its third coach in just four months. The decision to fire Baldivieso was the right one; some will say it even came too late. There’s nothing wrong with doing a U-turn, saying “we were wrong” and wiping the slate clean before facing the big challenge in the UAE next January.</p> \n<p>Uri Levy is the founder and editor of the BabaGol soccer blog.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A decade after the Water Authority managed to bring about a significant drop in household water usage in Israel, its achievement has eroded and during the past two years household water usage has gone up nearly 10 percent. This emerges from a strategic plan to cope with drought years recently formulated by the National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Ministry and which it soon plans to submit to the cabinet to be approved as a government resolution.</p> \n<p>The plan was drawn up because of the serious situation of Israel’s water sector. After five straight years of low precipitation, the level of Lake Kinneret is 38 centimeters below the lower red line before the summer even begins and the amount of water flowing in the Dan springs (the largest in the Middle East) is at an all-time low. The plan is supposed to deal with drought periods during the years 2018-2030. Along with increasing water production through desalination, the plan calls to renew activities to encourage saving water.</p> \n<p>According to the Infrastructure Ministry and the Water Authority, over the past two years household water consumption has gone up by more than 40 million cubic meters annually, a 10 percent increase. During the previous decade the Water Authority had conducted a massive publicity campaign to encourage water conservation that included the distribution of water-saving accessories for the home. The result was a 10 percent decline in water consumption.</p> \n<p>The ministry says the increase in water usage cannot be explained solely by Israel’s relatively rapid population growth. It stems, inter alia, from a drop in efficient use of water on the assumption that desalination makes water conservation less necessary. The plan also states that the effect of the increase in water tariffs in 2010 has faded and the drop in water prices last year was another disincentive to save water.</p> \n<p>The new plan proposes a 10 million shekel ($2.8 million) campaign to encourage water conservation. The Water Authority can, through existing regulations, limit municipal watering during certain hours of the day or impose restrictions on washing vehicles. But concrete steps have yet to be taken and most of the resources will be invested in public campaigns, which have proven successful in the past.</p> \n<p>As for desalination facilities, the plan calls for a special effort to build a desalination plant in the Western Galilee, an area defined as “cut off” from water, since its supply is based on local sources without backing from the national water carrier. Residents, however, have objected to the construction of a desalination plant near communities, which has delayed construction of such a facility.</p> \n<p>The ministry is thus proposing to build a plant that will produce 100 million cubic meters annually in the area of the Shraga Military Base in the Western Galilee. The draft resolution states that the construction of the facility should be advanced quickly through the planning process by the National Infrastructure Committee. It also states that the Defense Ministry should be instructed to fast-track the necessary solutions in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and the Water Authority to be able to build the facility at the Shraga base.</p> \n<p>Another proposal intended to expand the water supply is expected to generate opposition from environmental officials; it asks the Health Ministry to consider easing the regulations governing the drilling of wells near infrastructure lines, including fuel pipelines. At present, the ministry forbids the drilling of wells within a certain distance from infrastructure lines, for fear of leaks that would pollute the water. The draft resolution states that drilling will be allowed at shorter distances, on condition that protective measures are taken to prevent leaks from the infrastructure lines.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the midst of the interview with Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, at his office on a quiet Friday morning in Tel Aviv, loud drilling sounds were heard suddenly, from a lower floor. “Sometimes I feel as if I’m constantly being followed around by someone with a drill,” he jokes. “Almost every discussion seems to be accompanied by that noise.”</p> \n<p>Nine months before completing his assignment, Eisenkot is on his first round of interviews with print journalists. He seems to enjoy it about as much as having a wisdom tooth removed, but nevertheless he replies expansively and with relative openness to a long series of questions. The risk of a military escalation, particularly on the Palestinian front, is his chief concern, but there are other issues on his mind as well: above all, the need to guarantee that the army remains an army of the people, followed by addressing the military’s personnel crisis&nbsp;and protecting it from the claws of the politicians. Eisenkot has some choice words for the political figures who are consistently critical of him and the military.</p> \n<p>When asked which problems keep him awake at night, Eisenkot uses a clock metaphor to describe the urgency of the different issues: “The Palestinians are the second hand, Lebanon and Syria are the minute hand and Iran is the hour hand,” he says.</p> \n<p>Israel does not see indications that any of its neighbors intends to launch a war, Eisenkot says. It is, however, worried that an accumulation of events – Iran’s move to establish itself in Syria, the confidence that Hezbollah gained in the war there and its efforts to obtain guided-missile technology, as well as the uncertainty in the Palestinian sphere – will lead to unplanned escalation. That in turn could lead the various forces to unite.</p> \n<p>That said, Israel is in a position of greater strategic advantage now than in all its 70 years, which gives it unprecedented strength — “and our enemies understand that,” Eisenkot says.</p> \n<p>The entire Middle East is a tinderbox, but the Palestinians most of all, he says.</p> \n<p>Their situation, already complex, will become more so in the months to come, Eisenkot says – because of Land Day (Friday), Israel’s Independence Day (April 19), Nakba Day (May 15), the pending move of the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the winding down of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ era, the moribund peace process, and the fact that Hamas is in crisis in Gaza.</p> \n<p>“We are going to face big challenges in the context of the 70th Independence Day celebrations,” he predicts.</p> \n<p>The first challenge is expected this very Friday: Land Day, for which the Palestinians planned mass marches near the Gaza Strip fence. Eisenkot ordered Israeli forces by the Strip’s border to be beefed up, complete with snipers and crowd-control means, to thwart any attempt by the marchers to cross into Israel.</p> \n<p>The chief of staff describes Gazan economic and civic conditions as extremely harsh, but claims it falls short of a humanitarian crisis.</p> \n<p>“There are problems with the electricity and water supply, problems of basic subsistence that have caused extreme tensions in the Strip,” he says. Hamas has encountered difficulty keeping order and has been relaxing its restraint of radical Salafi organizations; it has also been watching in frustration as the IDF destroy its “attack tunnels.”</p> \n<p>But the chief of staff distinguished between these moves and long-term projects, which he believes can be discussed only after the Palestinians return two Israeli soldiers’ bodies as well as Israeli civilians held in the Strip. He also recommends that Hamas curb their expectations regarding future prisoner swaps. “They can dream on,” he says, maintaining that Israel won’t do another deal like it did with Gilad Shalit, freeing over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011 to bring him home. At best, Eisenkot says, there could be deals like the one after the 2006 Second Lebanon War, when dozens of bodies and a few Lebanese prisoners were exchanged for the remains of two Israeli soldiers.</p> \n<p>What Iran really wants</p> \n<p>Compared with the saber-rattling rhetoric emanating from both Jerusalem and Washington on the Iranian nuclear deal, Eisenkot is cautious, noting that no violations of the agreement by the Iranians “can be seen at present, but we assume that Iran can operate secretly. Therefore, keeping watch on developments there is the No. 1 mission for both the IDF and intelligence agencies. We are investing vast resources in obtaining the best intelligence about Iran and its operational ability,” he says. “If its intentions change, we will know. Right now the agreement, with all its faults, is working and is putting off realization of the Iranian nuclear vision by 10 to 15 years.”</p> \n<p>One issue not addressed by the agreement is the Iranian missile project, he says, which is alarming Europe and the Gulf nations as well. “I observe more international will to handle the Iranian missile threat than to reopen the nuclear agreement,” says the chief of staff.</p> \n<p>“Regarding Iran, the window of strategic opportunity is still open in our favor. If the Americans decide to withdraw from the agreement on May 12, we will have to rethink our strategic risk management.”</p> \n<p>The missile threat: People don’t get it</p> \n<p>Much of Eisenkot’s stint has been devoted to consolidating a multi-year plan called “Gideon,” the aim being to make the Israel Defense Forces better prepared for the next war.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot claims that with its combined upgraded abilities – in intelligence, in the air and on the ground and sea – the IDF will be able to win a war with Hezbollah that spreads to the Syrian front. He is confident the IDF will be able to quickly call up its reserves, even under a whole new level of fire from Hezbollah at the bases and warehouses.</p> \n<p>“The IDF’s abilities today cannot even be compared to 2006 in attacking targets, antiballistic defense and intelligence,” he says. “But I do not see victory without ground maneuvers. That’s a central part of the solution.”</p> \n<p>He admits that the public doesn’t realize how bad the threat of rockets from the north is, but he also doesn’t believe they should constantly be terrorized with new homefront-at-war scenarios. “We will have to deal with a state of emergency, but just for some weeks,” he says. The situation of the home front is going to be a lot worse than during the Second Lebanon War, he says: “The enemy has identified our weak point as the home front.” And that is where it will aim most of its firepower.</p> \n<p>A particularly bad day</p> \n<p>The worst incident during Eisenkot’s term as chief of staff came on February 10, when an Iranian drone was downed over Israeli territory and an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down, falling also on Israeli territory, in the north. In retaliation, the Israeli air force bombed Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot, however, rejects the popular interpretation in the press that Israel had teetered on the brink of war that day.</p> \n<p>Deterrence has been working on the Israel-Syrian border for 44 years, he observes. “Even after seven years of chaos in Syria, the Golan Heights is all in all a quiet front. Israel’s strategy there is the right one: no direct military involvement, civilian aid to people living in the villages by the border (on the other side), defining ISIS as the enemy and honoring past agreements with the Syrian army.”</p> \n<p>The F-16 shouldn’t have been hit, Eisenkot said, but added that over time, the balance between the sides is in Israel’s favor.</p> \n<p>He believes Syria’s recent aggressive tone arises because Assad’s regime has been prevailing in the civil war, and due to the Iranian effort to deepen its military presence in Syria as part of its long-term strategy. The Iranians knew Syria was moving into a new stage and wanted to demonstrate its capabilities in the air, on the sea and in intelligence. Meanwhile, Hezbollah is maturing militarily : It’s been working on obtaining more accurate guided missiles and better aerial defense, the chief of staff says.</p> \n<p>However, Israel has been thwarting these efforts, he notes, and for now Hezbollah’s accuracy isn’t up to the mark. “We won’t let them obtain advanced weapons,” he asserts.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot does admit to a correlation between the many air raids on Hezbollah arms convoys in Syria and the improvement in Syrian aerial defenses. Both sides have been escalating, Eisenkot says. “The punishment we dealt out became heavier. They realized they were getting slammed, that there is an operation against them, and began to take action against us.”</p> \n<p>Only about 1 percent of Israel’s attacks get reported in the press, Eisenkot noted.</p> \n<p>In terms of magnitude, the Iranian-Shi’ite presence in Syria remains limited, and hasn’t changed in recent years. Eisenkot estimates that there are about 2,000 advisers and fighters, about 7,500 Hezbollah people, and about 9,000 militias from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan in Syria taking orders from Tehran.</p> \n<p>Did Israel make unnecessary trouble for itself with its statements about red lines in Syria? Eisenkot doesn’t think so. “Ultimately it would be best for all Iranian-Shi'ite forces to leave Syria, including Hezbollah and the militias,” he says. “We will not allow them to approach the borders. I don’t boast about it, but we routinely, intensively take action to stymie the transfer of resources to Lebanon, and to foil the establishment [of Iranian or pro-Iranian] forces in the strip we defined along the Syrian border.” He declines to cite the geographical line Israel drew.</p> \n<p>Restraining influence on politicians </p> \n<p>Eisenkot’s term, says a senior officer who served under him and who for different reasons is not among his admirers, will be remembered mainly for his restraining influence, with which he prevented the percolating of dangerous ideas from the political arena into military echelons. “With regard to the use of force and to moral issues, he demonstrated a steadfastness that enabled the country to enjoy stability in these frenzied times. It’s hard to imagine his successor, whoever that may be, demonstrating the same kind of fortitude.”</p> \n<p>This comment, similar to others made by many people in the defense and political establishments, refers to specific debates such as a demand by cabinet members to enact collective punishment in the West Bank following severe terror attacks. In this matter Eisenkot and other generals blocked the tendency of politicians to respond to cries for revenge heard in the street or on social networks. On the weightier decisions, such as the air strikes in the north and, earlier (under chief of staff Benny Gantz), in setting goals during the last round of fighting in Gaza, Netanyahu’s approach is very close to the army’s positions.</p> \n<p>This is why Eisenkot lends no support to conspiracy theories recently heard on the left, which warn of a possible initiation of a war to deflect attention from Netanyahu’s criminal investigations. In a recent conversation, Eisenkot said there is no chance he would lend a hand to such a venture. In the interview with Haaretz, he says the considerations brought up in cabinet meetings are “responsible and pertinent. The politicians largely rely on the way in which we define the situation and on our recommendations for action. There is an ongoing dialogue between us. From where I stand I see the prime minister, the defense minister and the cabinet taking a thorough approach that addresses the interests of Israel’s security. I don’t see any conspiracies.”</p> \n<p>This is not the spirit he encounters outside cabinet sessions. Two years ago a soldier was stabbed to death in a terror attack, a day after Eisenkot gave a speech labeled “the scissors speech,” in which he said that soldiers standing behind a secure barrier do not have to empty an ammunition magazine at a girl armed with a knife or scissors. In response, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz posted on Facebook his hope that the soldier’s murderers had not drawn inspiration from the chief of staff’s speech.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot dismisses these words and other attacks on him as rhetoric for public consumption. “I make a distinction between what ministers say on the outside and discussions in closed rooms. On the outside they say what they say, each one according to his needs. I don’t want to relate to that. When they enter the room and we explain the situation and possible modes of operation I repeatedly note that their approach is professional and to the point.”</p> \n<p>Even more than his predecessor Gantz, Eisenkot has found himself caught up in culture wars and struggles for influence waged by different camps in Israeli society on their favorite playing ground, the territory of the IDF. Early in Gantz’s term there was a blow-up over the version of the memorial Yizkor prayer, first reported in Haaretz. Eisenkot insisted on taking the Jewish Education branch out of the jurisdiction of the Military Rabbinate, placing it under the Manpower Directorate. He reformulated the regulations guiding service by males and females, and got himself into an unnecessary argument with senior figures in the Zionist religious world due to a blanket enforcement of the prohibition on growing beards in the conscript army. These disputes, which should normally occupy only a fraction of a chief of staff’s valuable time, took up much of his time and placed him on a collision course with the religious right.</p> \n<p>Over the last year it seems the chief of staff has found himself alone on this front, causing him to make a tactical withdrawal to reduce frictions. This didn’t really help him. Rabbis and politicians, journalists and tweeters persistently assail him and the IDF. Arguments from different circles are part of the mix, including the approach to Elor Azaria, the soldier who killed an incapacitated Palestinian assailant in Hebron; the expansion of female service to include combat roles; groundless feelings of discrimination regarding the promotion of religious officers and even the baseless claim that outstanding commanders had been the subject of criminal accusations because they were part of the Zionist religious camp. Tactical mishaps such as the armed infiltration from Gaza in recent days have also been met with charges that the army is showing weakness and that it is hiding the truth about its performance from the public.</p> \n<p>When Eisenkot is asked about these, he quotes an article written by Haaretz’s late military correspondent Zeev Schiff in 1995. Schiff wrote that the IDF had been knocked off its perch at the center of the consensus in Israeli society and that the right wing, whose ideology had always favored the army and sanctified security, was now attacking the army as a failing one that was unprepared for war.</p> \n<p>“Then too people claimed the army was feeble, not sufficiently reactive. Schiff foresaw the future, warning that this attitude was a process containing within it a time tomb. This is more or less what we are witnessing now. He saw this clearly. I have gained experience in this area for 20 years, ever since I became the prime minister’s military secretary (first with Ehud Barak, later with Ariel Sharon) in 1999. In those years you could hear the same words by the same people. These are the people who now assail us over events such as the company commander who didn’t react when attacked by the teenage girl Ahed Tamimi – these are people trying to promote an agenda. They don’t really care about the IDF’s image or about Israel’s security. This is a very serious phenomenon. I can only express my regret that these statements were made. This is an attempt to delegitimize the army. They want a different kind of army than the one I envisage, which is a state-oriented one, professional and with well-defined goals. That’s what it should remain. When it is no longer that, we can start talking of an existential threat.”</p> \n<p>On the backdrop of the dispute regarding female conscripts, Safed’s municipal rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu accused Eisenkot of causing a drop in the motivation [of men] to serve in combat units, and called for Eisenkot’s dismissal. “Some of these sayings stem from – I won’t use the term ignorance – not knowing the facts,” responds Eisenkot. “People make foolish pronouncements and I’m sure they regret them later. The mixed service of men and women has been around since the army was established. Our approach to this is practical, with the purpose of making the army stronger. There is not a single case in which we forced an Orthodox male conscript to serve in a mixed combat unit. As far as I’m concerned, any dialogue with Zionist religious rabbis over mixed-gender service is over. We’re done with addressing it. I will not hold any more meetings on this topic.”</p> \n<p>Eisenkot notes a “deep frustration” among the people attacking him, “stemming from a revolution taking place in their camp, not with me, concerning what they hold dearest. Excellent young people are coming up there, knowing how to choose what’s best for them, knowing that they are respected by the IDF, which allows them to maintain their religious lifestyle while in service. Religious females enlist since they are searching for a meaningful mission and the army knows how to provide them with suitable conditions during their service.”</p> \n<p>While Eisenkot’s predecessors are already deeply engaged in the political fracas or spending their time endlessly deliberating whether to jump in, Eisenkot shows no signs of interest in that direction. In any case, a year’s leave still awaits him, as well as three more years of a cooling-off period, according to a law passed by the Netanyahu government.</p> \n<p>His term will not be extended for a fifth year, even though a trial balloon on this issue was launched in the media recently. “Come next January 1 to the General Staff parade ground and see me handing over the baton,” he says. “There are excellent candidates for replacing me. My role is to bring forward several of them. Two have served as deputy chiefs of staff (Yair Golan and his replacement Aviv Kochavi). Personally, I won’t recommend anyone. That is the politicians’ job.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Former U.S. presidential candidate Michele Bachmann delivered an emotional mea culpa on Sunday for previous statements that caused great offense to the Jewish community.</p> \n<p>In an interview with a Christian radio program in November 2015, the former Republican congresswoman for Minnesota – who is a devout Christian – had suggested that mass conversions of Jews be undertaken in order to expedite the second coming of Jesus.</p> \n<p>“I apologize, profoundly apologize and ask forgiveness from almighty God for my statements that were said in ignorance and brought pain,” she said Sunday, while accompanying a group of Christian evangelicals to the Knesset.</p> \n<p>Bachmann was participating in a special joint Bible study class for Christians and Jews. It was attended primarily by Christian evangelicals and Orthodox Jews – two groups known as key supporters of Israel’s right-wing government and of U.S. President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Many of the Christian participants were in Israel to attend Monday afternoon’s gala ceremony marking the U.S. Embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Speaking with reporters after the Bible study class, Bachmann said: “We are so grateful to President Donald Trump for his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. He’s taken that element of warfare off the table. That element of warfare is a propaganda tool that says the Jewish people do not have a right to this land. Donald Trump says not only do they have a right, but they have a legal and legitimate right to designate Jerusalem as their capital. That is a powerful statement.”</p> \n<p>The co-founder of the ultra-conservative Tea Party movement added, “We believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that this move will bring not only greater peace to Israel, but greater peace to the region.”</p> \n<p>Trump’s decision has been widely criticized by Arab states and U.S. allies as unilateral and endangering peace efforts by seemingly recognizing only Israel’s right to Jerusalem – a city Palestinians also claim as their capital for a future state. Most foreign diplomats are planning to skip a Sunday evening reception that will precede the official relocation ceremony.</p> \n<p>Bachmann, who lived on a kibbutz in southern Israel in the 1970s, is a regular visitor to the country. She said she considered U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital to be “a fulfillment of biblical prophecy.”</p> \n<p>About 170 Christians and Jews participated in the joint Bible study class, sponsored by the special Knesset caucus that encourages Bible study. The caucus is headed by MK Yehudah Glick (Likud), an Orthodox rabbi known for leading the fight to permit Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount – Jerusalem’s flash-point holy site.</p> \n<p>The Knesset regularly holds Bible study sessions, but only recently have Christians been invited to attend.</p> \n<p>Behind the initiative to include them is a California-based evangelical organization known as the Schindler Society, founded by mega-church pastor Jim Garlow and his wife, Rosemary Schindler Garlow.</p> \n<p>The organization was named after Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust and inspiration for the Steven Spielberg movie “Schindler’s List.”</p> \n<p>Rosemary Garlow is often presented as the niece of Schindler, but in fact she has no blood connection to the iconic rescuer: It was her ex-husband, from whom she is divorced, who was a nephew of Schindler’s.</p> \n<p>Her second husband, who served on Trump’s faith advisory board during the presidential campaign, has been known to be a prominent anti-gay crusader. Ten years ago, Jim Garlow was instrumental in rallying conservative groups behind a proposed ban on gay marriage in California. Proposition 8 was later approved, only to be subsequently overturned by the courts.</p> \n<p>Among the initial group of evangelicals to throw their support behind Trump in the 2016 election, Jim Garlow has compared Americans who would vote for Hillary Clinton to Germans who failed to resist Nazism.</p> \n<p>The Schindler Society held its inaugural Jewish-Christian Bible study class in the Knesset in February, but Jim Garlow was asked not to attend in order to avoid a public relations fiasco. The class had unintentionally been scheduled on a day that coincided with the Knesset’s annual tribute to the LGBTQ community.</p> \n<p>Garlow did, however, attend the second study class, held soon afterward, as well as the third on Sunday. Speaking during the session, he said that “one thing strangely lacking” from his training in Christian theology was the history of the persecution of Jews at the hands of Christians.</p> \n<p>“We say to our Jewish friends in this room, ‘Thank you for forgiving us and for letting us come here today to your special place on this Jerusalem Day – and just 24 hours before the embassy move to Jerusalem – as a way of affirming wrongs that were done.’”</p> \n<p>Garlow’s Jerusalem Day comment was a reference to the annual celebration, this year commemorating the 51st anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War.</p> \n<p>Garlow stressed that the purpose of the interreligious Bible classes was not for Christians to teach Jews, but rather for them to learn from Jews.</p> \n<p>The Bible class, whose theme was Jerusalem, was delivered by Glick, as well as another Orthodox rabbi and one of a handful of Orthodox women in Israel ordained as the equivalents of rabbis in matters of halakhic rulings. As they spoke, Christians in attendance often expressed their approval with “Amens” and “Hallelujahs.”</p> \n<p>At the introduction to his talk, Glick – who was sporting a tie with the Israeli flag printed on it – said that among the “treasure chest of miracles God has opened in recent days” was “the world recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” In fact, only a small handful of countries have recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON - One of the speakers at Monday’s ceremony marking the relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem will be a Christian leader with a history of hateful comments against Muslims, Mormons, gay people and Jews.</p> \n<p>Dallas-based Robert Jeffress, a Baptist pastor with a large following in Texas, told Fox News that he would be leading a prayer during the ceremony. Jeffress&nbsp;serves as an informal advisor to Trump on faith-based issues of U.S. President Donald Trump, and is also known for his support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.</p> \n<p>As&nbsp;Mother Jones&nbsp;reported, during a 2010 lecture, Jeffress claimed, &quot;God sends good people to Hell.&nbsp;Not only do religions like Mormonism, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism--not only do they lead people away from from God, they lead people to an eternity of separation from&nbsp;God in Hell.&quot;</p> \n<p>Jeffress once said that “the dark dirty secret of Islam&quot; is that &quot;it is a religion that promotes pedophilia,” and that Islam is “a heresy from the pit of hell.”</p> \n<p>Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate, called on Monday to remove Jeffress from his participation in the embassy opening ceremony. Romney, one of the most prominent Mormon politicians in the United States, said Jeffress was a &quot;religious fanatic&quot; and accused him of incitement against religious minorities. &quot;Such a person should not lead the service at the opening of the embassy in Jerusalem,&quot; added Romney, who is currently running for an open Senate seat from Utah despite his clear identification with the Republican Party. He is considered one of President Trump's critics in the party.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the Texas Baptist pastor hit back in response to criticism of his views on Muslims, Mormons, gay people and Jews.</p> \n<p>Around 20 percent of Israeli citizens and around 40 percent of Jerusalem residents are Muslims, and the new embassy, according to U.S. officials, will also provide services to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; U.S. embassy move to Jerusalem: Everything you need to know&nbsp; ■&nbsp;These are the countries participating in Israel's celebrations of U.S. embassy move ■&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. embassy opening, Nakba day to sweep Palestinian protesters in Gaza, West Bank&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jeffress has also called homosexuality “a perversion,” saying gay people engage in “the most detestable acts you can imagine.”</p> \n<p>The Mormons have also felt Jeffress’ wrath; he has called them a “cult” not truly part of Christianity. In one speech, after bashing Islam and Mormonism, Jeffress warned that all Jews will go to hell, saying that “you can’t be saved by being a Jew.”</p> \n<p>In an interview on Fox News Monday morning, Jeffress both dismissed and defended his controversial remarks. &quot;These were comments ripped out of context from years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;Historic Christianity, for 2000 years, has taught that salvation is faith in Christ alone, and the fact that I, and millions of evangelical Christians still believe that, is not bigoted and not newsworthy.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jeffress has praised Trump for his decision last December to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, equating it with President Harry Truman’s decision in 1948 to recognize Israel as a state.</p> \n<p>“Jerusalem has been the object of the affection of both Jews and Christians down through history and the touchstone of prophecy,” Jeffress said at the time, “but most importantly, God gave Jerusalem — and the rest of the Holy Land — to the Jewish people.”</p> \n<p>As he put it, “President Trump is a modern-day profile in courage, accomplishing what no other president has been willing to do.”</p> \n<p>Allison Sommer Kaplan contributed to this report.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The loss of life in Gaza at the ends of Israeli army snipers is not only gruesome, it’s reprehensible – because lethal force is not the only way to confront protesters.</p> \n<p>We in America know that from our own history.</p> \n<p>We’ve been thinking a lot about civil rights in America,recently. Last month marked 50 years since the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the passage of the 1968 Civil Rights Act.</p> \n<p>In the year-and-a-half since Donald Trump was elected, we’ve seen a resurgence of racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic incidents, and signs of white supremacist groups moving out of the shadows and into&nbsp;town squares&nbsp;not en masse, but enough to make us realize that America remains rife with racism.</p> \n<p>When most Americans look back on how police dealt with civil rights protesters in the 1960s, particularly African-Americans, it’s with a wince and a degree of shame. Water cannons turned on demonstrators were a degrading and painful way to beat back crowds. The blunt force of the water sometimes caused&nbsp;facial fractures, lost eyes and forced falls that led to other injuries.</p> \n<p>But rarely death.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Perhaps the Israel Defense Forces ought to give it a try as a tool of crowd control. After all, spraying a few thousand protesters on the Gaza border with water might knock down dozens of angry young men, douse tire fires, and cause a concussion or two, but it wouldn’t cause 60 deaths in one day.</p> \n<p>In many countries from Chile to India, water cannons are a standard tool for non-lethal crowd control, sometimes used with colored water used to &quot;tag&quot; participants for later prosecution.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are a myriad of other methods of riot containment that are used worldwide and generally don’t result in scores of deaths. Why the Israeli army hasn’t employed them up to now is a troubling moral question.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It’s simply unacceptable that the same Israel that prides itself on innovation and ingenuity - cannot find a better way to stop thousands of Gazans threatening to overrun the border than to open fire on them with live ammunition.</p> \n<p>Those technological achievements were, ironically, being lauded by Jared Kushner himself as he spoke at the U.S. embassy opening, while live fire was being used on Gazans.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I know, I know. It’s considered politically incorrect for me, as an American Jew who spent 15 years of my life in Israel and has recently returned to whence I came, to pass judgment on anything the IDF does.</p> \n<p>How dare I? How dare&nbsp;you? How dare anyone who doesn’t live in Israel, who doesn’t live in a community bordering Gaza, who isn’t serving on the front lines right now, suggest we know the first thing about how to contain a riot or respond to a terrorist threat?</p> \n<p>So if you’re offended by the very notion that I dare say these things, it won’t matter that I’ve witnessed massive protests in a few different countries on this planet, and feel confident that there is more than one way to contain an angry crowd.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I recognize that this is a flawed analogy on many levels. Mahmoud Abbas is no MLK and Ismail Haniyeh is no Mahatma Gandhi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, one Palestinian I spoke with yesterday thought the model used by Jerusalemites and West Bankers on the Temple Mount last summer - daily prayer protests in the streets calling on the Netanyahu government to remove metal detectors placed at the entrance to the al-Aqsa Mosque - were far more effective, engendering international attention while largely remaining nonviolent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protesters in Gaza lobbing rocks and Molotov cocktails or cutting through the fence are far from the textbook definition of &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; engaging in civil disobedience.</p> \n<p>But neither do they present a lethal threat to 13 battalions of Israel army forces.</p> \n<p>Indeed, to call every teenage protester a terrorist recruited by Hamas bent on murdering Israelis flies in the face of truth. For Jared Kushner to say, in the day’s sole mention of the day’s accumulating death toll, that Gazan protestors were &quot;part of the problem, and not part of the solution” is to fail to recognize that Gazans themselves - yes, flesh and blood humans living just over hour southwest of Tel Aviv - must be part of the solution.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The feeling of being forgotten and caged in is part of the reason they are protesting, most of them with full knowledge that reaching the homes of their grandparents, rusty old keys in hand, is a symbolic show rather than a realistic goal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Do we really imagine this so-called &quot;March of Return&quot; to be an existential threat to the strongest army in the Middle East? Demonstrators might be wild with rage and even psyched up by Hamas slogans, but they’re not armed and equipped to take on Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Are we to the point where the IDF is more worried about the optics of setting a precedent – a Gazan reaching Israeli soil – than the loss of life?</p> \n<p>Hamas may as well be sending young demonstrators into a firing squad.

        "text":["<p>Mainstream local public opinion celebrated Netta Barzilai’s Eurovision win as a national holiday, and perhaps a victory for feminism as well. But among Israel’s critics, at home and abroad, including those who are not necessarily BDS supporters, the event is perceived as one that could drop like a ripe fruit into the hands of the Israeli propaganda machine.</p> \n<p>Can we look at this subject in a manner a little less polarizing, a way that doesn’t choose only one side in this story?</p> \n<p>Indeed, we can see Barzilai’s win as a feminist victory of a person who does not give in to the body-image culture, as a person whose song “Toy” connects in spirit to the worldwide #MeToo movement.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When Netanyahu, anti-BDS activists and #Metoo all do the chicken dance&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel's winning Eurovision #chickensong toys with Israel-haters&nbsp;■&nbsp;How Netanyahu congratulating Eurovision winner turned into a digital insult</p> \n<p>The Eurovision Song Contest was always more than just a competition between countries. Especially on questions of sexuality, gender and gender identity, the Eurovision was an arena where the winning contestant represented much more than a specific country. The best example is Israel’s Dana International, whose win in 1998 was a hallmark for transgender recognition; her identity and the “International” in her stage name showed that she represented the LGBT community everywhere.</p> \n<p>After her win, when she was asked about the opposition to her of some ultra-Orthodox politicians, she said she represented anyone who wants to be represented by her, and thus deconstructing the idea of representing a certain identity in general and a national identity in particular.</p> \n<p>When Conchita Wurst of Austria won the Eurovision in 2014, it was perceived as a victory for recognition of complex gender identities over homophobia, especially coming at that time from Russia. In this sense, Barzilai’s win, which speaks of her difference as a woman who doesn’t fit the reigning body image and who sings about women’s empowerment in the face of male harassment, continues a Eurovision tradition of gender representation to cross borders and having the potential to empower.</p> \n<p>But Barzilai, who spoke of her win as one for acceptance of those who are different, still represents a country that does not excel in accepting the other. During the time Barzilai was taking part in Eurovision, Israel continued in its occupation of millions of rights-deprived Palestinians, killing protesters in Gaza and making plans to violate the rights of asylum seekers living in Israel.</p> \n<p>Anybody who complains about involving politics here is either innocent or pretending innocence: Barzilai herself told Kan broadcasting that her win would be something positive for Israeli hasbara. In a congratulatory phone call, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even called her Israel’s best ambassador.</p> \n<p>The Israeli government coopting Barzilai’s win – coopting the public relations with which she by her own admission might take part in – could serve as gender-washing. Israel is now seen to be sending a feminist message, and as a state that expresses democratic values.</p> \n<p>Dana International was coopted for a similar purpose when, 14 years after her victory, the Israeli ambassador to the United States mentioned her Eurovision victory as evidence of Israel’s supposed commitment to LGBT rights – a commitment that Israel’s envoys like to wave around, even if in fact the government has for years opposed any change in legislation on these issues, and progress toward equality comes mainly thanks to the courts.</p> \n<p>In this public relations machine, the goal is to normalize Israel and build its image as a country that, while it can be criticized here and there for its treatment of the Palestinians, is part of liberal, democratic Europe. Thus the reality of the occupation and de facto apartheid is blurred. In this context, it should be remembered that Israel’s very participation in Eurovision – even while it is a member of the European Broadcasting Union – is part of its fantasy of being part of Europe and not the Middle East.</p> \n<p>And so we may speak of the tension between the two meanings of Barzilai’s win. One is boundary-crossing feminism and the other is national, the latter being the one that will be widely invoked, especially before Eurovision is held next year in Jerusalem, for propaganda purposes.</p> \n<p>It’s impossible to ignore these two meanings, and it is a mistake to reduce the win to one of them, but it’s also impossible to separate them: The image that “Toy” has created for us of a country that accepts those who are different is a prominent and necessary one, and it stands against the backdrop of a reality in which Israel’s attitude to “the other” is quite poor.</p>",

        "text":["<p>&gt;&gt; Follow Haaretz's live updates as U.S. officially relocates embassy to Jerusalem &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>If the Trump administration’s intention was to offend Jewish sensibilities with its pick of an evangelical minister to give a prayer at the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, it succeeded.</p> \n<p>Pastor Robert Jeffress, who will speak at the event, is on record as stating that Jews are going to hell - together with all other non born-again Christians – or, at least, not to heaven.</p> \n<p>If it wanted to offend Muslims, the White House also couldn’t have done better, since Jeffress has also made very derogatory remarks about Islam, which he has reportedly slammed as an &quot;evil,&quot; &quot;violent&quot; and &quot;false&quot; religion.</p> \n<p>Nor has Jeffress spared Mormons, since he called it a non-Christian &quot;cult,&quot; when explaining why he thought his followers should oppose Mitt Romney during the 2008 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries. His condemnation of gays (&quot;gay is not okay&quot;) is just as disturbing for the LGBT community.</p> \n<p>That Jeffress’ penchant for religious intolerance hasn’t barred him from becoming a member of President Donald Trump’s Evangelical Advisory Board and becoming part of the recently reconstituted White House Faith Initiative is troubling.</p> \n<p>But as with much else with this administration, loyalty to the president - with whom Jeffress says he has prayed -&nbsp;atones for a multitude of sins.</p> \n<p>But the presence of Jeffress at the highly symbolic ceremony that will commemorate Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem of Israel’s capital is no accident. It’s also likely to highlight again the split between the Jewish right and the Jewish left.</p> \n<p>Many Jews see his presence as an insult, as well as inappropriate. On Twitter, Rabbi Rick Jacobs, the head of the U.S. Reform movement, said Jeffress’ attacks on Judaism and Islam ought to mean he should be &quot;kept far away&quot; from the embassy ceremony and that &quot;Jerusalem doesn’t need the prayers of a religious bigot.&quot;</p> \n<p>But no one should be surprised if not everyone will share that opinion.</p> \n<p>Though Jeffress may believe Jews won’t be rubbing elbows in the hereafter with those who attend his 13,000-member First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, most pro-Israel activists as well as the few Israelis who pay any attention to the issue aren’t likely to be that upset about it.</p> \n<p>Just as Trump cares little about anything but the megachurch pastor’s willingness to support him despite his personal moral failings, groups like AIPAC as well as the Israeli government regard Jeffress’ passionate support for Israel as the only relevant fact about him.</p> \n<p>If support for Zionism is baked deep into the political DNA of America, that is not so much a function of AIPAC’s lobbying operation, or the generosity of Jewish donors to political candidates, as it is of religion.</p> \n<p>Sympathy for the notion of a Jewish return to the land of Israel and their right to sovereignty there has been a powerful force in American Protestantism dating back to the early days of the republic. The first president to endorse this cause wasn’t Harry Truman or Woodrow Wilson but John Adams. In recent decades, enthusiasm for Israel and disdain for its foes has become a major feature of an evangelical movement that was unashamed to flex its political muscles.</p> \n<p>The true engine of the bipartisan consensus in favor of the Jewish state has been ministers like Jeffress and their followers. The transformation of the Republican Party from one in which pro-Israel sentiment was lukewarm a half century ago, to a lockstep pro-Israel (a shift that has been matched by the decline of support for Israel among Democrats), if not pro-Likud party, is largely the result of evangelical enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Jeffress stand on Israel is particularly instructive. In a Fox News interview about being asked to give a prayer at the embassy opening, Jeffress made it clear that as far as he was concerned, Jerusalem had been Israel’s capital for 3,000 years, not 70.</p> \n<p>He said he was happy about the move because it contradicted, &quot;the left’s lie that Jews stole the land&quot; from Arabs.</p> \n<p>Above all, Jeffress believes, as do most of his fellow Christian conservatives that support for Israel is vital to America’s well being.</p> \n<p>For him, that’s not a geopolitical analysis but one determined by the biblical injunction that God will bless those nations that bless Israel. As far as Jeffress is concerned, &quot;God blesses the U.S. because we have chosen to bless Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Should that be enough to render him kosher in Jewish eyes at a time when anti-Semitism and anti-Zionist agitation is on the rise?</p> \n<p>Jeffress’ willingness to speak openly about who he thinks is going to Heaven puts a slightly different wrinkle in the long running debate about whether Jews should care about the motives of Christian Zionists. Many Jews think Evangelicals are only supportive of Israel because of the notion that its creation and its ultimate victory over its opponents will bring on the end days and trigger the rapture or the return of Jesus and an expected mass conversion of the Jews.</p> \n<p>While a belief in this scenario is by no means universal among evangelicals, most pro-Israel activists respond to such fears by noting the absurdity of Jews who do not believe such theological events are possible being worried about what Christians will do if Jesus reappears.</p> \n<p>Surely Jews are unthreatened by anyone’s expectations about the return of the Christian messiah, especially when those who hold such beliefs are so eager to help defend the Jewish people from their enemies in the present. Nor should we care much about who Jeffress thinks is going to Heaven.</p> \n<p>But while his eschatological views ought not to concern us, it is not too much to ask someone who puts himself forward as a representative of people of faith in the public square to be civil. The sorts of attacks that Jeffress has made on religions and groups other than his own feed bigotry.</p> \n<p>His willingness to say that Christians should take candidates' faith background into consideration when casting their votes is not only prejudiced, but also antithetical to the spirit of religious liberty that most evangelicals believe is the key to the defense of their own rights.</p> \n<p>These are certainly not the sorts of things we want to hear from someone who is in a position to advise a president whose own commitment to tolerance is shaky.</p> \n<p>All persons of good faith should welcome Jeffress’ prayers for the peace of Jerusalem and the safety of Israel. Nor should we question the sincerity of his pro-Israel beliefs or those of the rest of the Christian conservative community.</p> \n<p>Yet his presence at the embassy ceremony is a reminder that there is a price to be paid for uncritical acceptance of pro-Israel figures whose attitude toward faith is inconsistent with religious freedom.</p> \n<p>Jeffress’ motives for backing Israel are irrelevant. But it is not too much to ask the administration, the Israeli government or pro-Israel activists to hold Jeffress as accountable for his prejudice as they do people like Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for their bigotry. Jeffress’ Zionism is praiseworthy, but it can’t give him a pass for attacking other faiths.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

        "text":["<p>We use the word &quot;Armageddon&quot; to mean the end of the world, but where did the word come from? How did it become associated with the final catastrophe that will end humanity? This turns out to be a difficult question to answer, because it requires us to peer into the mind of a man we only know of as &quot;John.&quot;</p> \n<p>Early Judaism had no tradition of the world ending in a day of divine judgment. No such notion appears in First Temple-period material in the Hebrew Bible. But the idea does suddenly appear in prophetic books penned after the late 6th century B.C.E., such as Deutero-Isaiah, Zechariah and Daniel. For example:</p> \n<p>“Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you” (Zechariah 2:11).</p> \n<p>Since this belief is uncommon in ancient religions, it could hardly be a coincidence that Jews began to believe in a final reckoning just when the Persians entered their lives and became their overlords (during the exile in Babylon). The Persian religion, Zoroastrianism, holds that the world will end with a final showdown between good and evil. Jews must have learned it from them.</p> \n<p>When Christianity branched off from Judaism 2,000 years ago, it took this belief. The concept appears throughout the Christian Bible, and in fact the Book of Revelations is wholly devoted to it.</p> \n<p>Revelations consists of a prophetic description of how the world will end. Its writer identifies himself as John, but other than his name, nothing is known of him, and the traditional identification of him with John the Apostle is likely not true.</p> \n<p>Yet whoever this John was, he played a decisive role in molding the Christian conception of the eschatological end of days. John, who wrote Revelations in Greek, also bestowed upon the English language two words for the end of the worlds: apocalypse and Armageddon. The origin of the first is clear, but the latter is puzzling.</p> \n<p>&quot;Apocalypse&quot; is a Greek noun meaning “uncovering” or “revelation.” It is the first word of the book in its original Greek. Thus, as was the common practice at the time, it became used as the name of the book.</p> \n<p>Since the book describes the end of the world, its Greek title began to be used by English speakers to refer to the end of the world itself, which is how we got the word apocalypse.</p> \n<p>The origin of the word Armageddon is far more difficult to explain.</p> \n<p>Out of the mouth of dragons</p> \n<p>In Revelations, Armageddon appears in Chapter 16, where John tells us that he heard “a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, ‘Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.’”</p> \n<p>He then goes on to describe these “bowls of God’s wrath” being poured on the earth: The first is an outbreak of “festering sores”; the second the turning of the sea to blood and the death of all that live in it; the third is the turning of the rivers into blood; the fourth is the scorching of the people by the burning son; the fifth is “the kingdom of the beast” being plunged into darkness; the sixth is the drying up of the River Euphrates.</p> \n<p>Then before he gets to the seventh and final bowl - a mighty thunderstorm accompanied by massive earthquakes and a hailstorm of biblical proportions - he says that “he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon” (16:16).</p> \n<p>Who exactly is gathered to Armageddon is not exactly clear from context. It might be “three impure spirits that looked like frogs” and “came out of the mouth of the dragon” or &quot;the kings of the whole world.&quot;</p> \n<p>Either way, according to John, just before the world comes to an end, they will convene at “a place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon.”</p> \n<p>Whatever John meant by this, it is clear that he believed that just before the end of the world, something momentous would take place there. Later Christian theologians interpreted this as meaning that this would be the site of the showdown between the forces of good and evil, which will obviously end with the victory of God and the good.</p> \n<p>But where did John get “Armageddon” from? The most common interpretation is that John was mangling the words har Megiddo, that is, &quot;Mount Megiddo.&quot; But where he got the phrase har Megiddo from is a mystery that scholars have been trying to explain ever since.</p> \n<p>The view from Megiddo</p> \n<p>The identification of the town of Megiddo with the site of apocalypse has some merit, since it is mentioned several times in the Bible, tellingly, as the site of several epic battles, such as the Israelites vs. the Canaanites (Judges 5:19) and Judah vs. Egypt. In the latter struggle, King Josiah, who the bible explicitly calls the best of the Judean kings, was killed:</p> \n<p>&quot;While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed him at Megiddo&quot; (2 Kings 23:29).</p> \n<p>The main challenge to the interpretation that John was referring to a Hebrew text that talked of har Megiddo, is the fact that Jews never referred to a “Mount Megiddo” – and for good reason. There is no mountain at Megiddo. At most the site could be called a small hill, or more accurately, a tell.</p> \n<p>In fact, when the Bible actually refers to a geographic feature related to Megiddo, it is not a mountain but a valley:</p> \n<p>“On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo” (Zechariah 12:11).</p> \n<p>Perhaps John got just got that fact wrong. Or maybe he thought the valley would become a mountain. It is unclear.</p> \n<p>A scholar named John Day, writing in 1994, has suggested that John mixed the eschatological message of Zechariah 12:11, which features Megiddo, with the text of Ezekiel 38 and 39), which does feature a mountain, albeit not Megiddo:</p> \n<p>“In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate” (Ezekiel 38:8).</p> \n<p>Meaning, maybe John took Ezekiel's mountain and Zechariah's plains of Megiddo and wound up with &quot;Mount Megiddo&quot;. Perhaps.</p> \n<p>Another avenue taken by theologians and scholars suggests that the original word was “megiddon,” not Megiddo at all – but a word derived from the root G-D-D (or G-D-ayin), which would mean the mountain in question was the mountain of “gathering” (or “being cut off” – meaning, “destruction”).</p> \n<p>The Greek translation of Zechariah 12:11 may relate to “the plain of Megiddo” in this way, but no such high-altitude gathering places appear anywhere in the Hebrew writings that have come to us.</p> \n<p>So it seems that we will have to wait for the apocalypse or Armageddon in order to find out what exactly John meant. If evangelical supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump have their way, and his decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem spurs that final reckoning - we may not have to wait long.</p>",

One Russian commander boasted of working alongside Russian troops who said they were on vacation while fighting in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>As of December 2017, the Defense Ministry has refused to say how many of its troops are in Syria, although one estimate based on absentee ballots cast in the Russian parliamentary election last year indicated 4,300 personnel were deployed there. That number probably rose this year because Moscow sent Russian military police to patrol de-escalation zones.</p> \n<p>The Russian people are not very enthused by the idea of an empire that would involve their boys coming home in body bags. Theres clearly a lack enthusiasm for this conflict, said Mark Galeotti, senior researcher at the Institute of International Relations in Prague.</p> \n<p>The Russian parliament is working on a bill to regulate private military companies, a senior lawmaker said Wednesday after reports that an unknown number of Russian military contractors were killed in a U.S. strike in Syria.</p> \n<p>Retired Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, head of the defense committee in the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said the government needs to oversee private military contractors.</p> \n<p>“The state must be directly involved in issues related to the life and health of our citizens,” he said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.</p> \n<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report</p>",

        "text":["<p>Russian fighters were among those killed when U.S.-led coalition forces clashed with pro-government forces in Syria this month, former associates of the dead said on Monday - however the majority of casualties are believed to be hired mercenaries from&nbsp;para-military company Wagner.</p> \n<p>A U.S. official has said more than 100 fighters aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad died when coalition and local coalition-backed forces thwarted a large attack overnight on Feb. 7. However, other local reports place the death toll as high as 200.</p> \n<p>Russia's Defence Ministry, which supports Assad's forces in the Syrian civil war, said at the time that pro-government militias involved in the incident had been carrying out reconnaissance and no Russian servicemen had been in the area.</p> \n<p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday it had no information about Russian mercenaries reportedly being killed in Syria, saying it only knew about Russian nationals who had been deployed there as members of the Russian armed forces.</p> \n<p>It was responding to media reports citing associates of Russian mercenaries saying some of them had been killed this month when U.S.-led coalition forces clashed with pro-government forces in Syria's Deir al-Zor province.</p> \n<p>&quot;We don't have information about other Russians who might be in Syria,&quot; Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call when asked about the alleged deaths.</p> \n<p>But at least two Russian men fighting informally with pro-government forces were killed in the incident in Deir al-Zor province, their associates told Reuters on Monday. Putin's years-long incursion into Syria is deeply unpopular domestically and has long been plagued by reports that the Russian government under reports the official death toll of Russians in Syria for political reasons.</p> \n<p>One of the dead was named as Vladimir Loginov, a Cossack from Russia's Kaliningrad exclave. Maxim Buga, a leader of the Cossack community there, said Loginov had been killed around Feb. 7 along with &quot;dozens&quot; of other Russian fighters.</p> \n<p>The other man killed was named as Kirill Ananiev, described as a radical Russian nationalist. Alexander Averin, a spokesman for the nationalist party he was linked to, told Reuters Ananiev had been killed in shelling in the same fighting on Feb. 7.</p> \n<p>The New York Times reported Tuesday that individual Russians have begun speaking out about the death of loved ones in Syria, some are even announcing the specific names of victims on social media.</p> \n<p>Reuters was unable to independently confirm either man's death.</p> \n<p>Grigory Yavlinsky, a veteran liberal politician who is running for president in elections next month, called on President Vladimir Putin to disclose how many Russians had been killed in Syria and in what circumstances.</p> \n<p>&quot;If there was large-scale loss of life of Russian citizens, the relevant officials, including the commander-in-chief of our armed forces (Putin), are obliged to tell the country about it and decide who carries responsibility for this,&quot; Yavlinsky said in a statement released by his Yabloko party.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli director Samuel Maoz expressed disappointment&nbsp;last month that his film “Foxtrot” wasn’t named as one of the five Oscar finalists for Best Foreign Language Film. In a recent interview with Neta Alexander in Haaretz, Maoz offered the explanation that while the film was a favorite, the American voters were far outnumbered by the Europeans.</p> \n<p>Maoz’s disappointment is understandable, given that since September, when his film won the Grand Jury prize at the Venice Film Festival, he was confident he was on the way to the Oscars, all the more so following all the free PR the film received courtesy of Culture Minister Miri Regev’s vocal criticism of it, which undoubtedly gained it some new supporters overseas.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s not so easy to accept Maoz’s argument that “the cultural boycott of Israel, particularly in Britain, worked against me,” seeing that “Foxtrot” was on the list of nine finalists for the Oscar, having beaten numerous other films. Maoz could just as well ascribe the film’s failure to win a Golden Globe, for which it wasn’t even nominated, to that award being given by the members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But that would be a lame excuse that belittles the quality of the other films in the competition (that maybe were just better).</p> \n<p>Surprising hits</p> \n<p>Let me cautiously suggest another possibility: The members of the American Academy of Motion Pictures and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association have grown weary of films about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They really don’t feel like seeing any more movies about the occupation. They’d rather watch films about everyday subjects, like “Loveless,” the Oscar-nominated Russian film by Andrey Zvyagintsev, about a divorcing Moscow couple fighting over custody of their son; or Swedish entry “The Square,” directed by Ruben &Ouml;stlund, about a modern art curator who learns to appreciate his life anew after his cell phone is stolen.</p> \n<p>Israel holds an unflattering Oscar record: Israeli films have received 10 nominations for Best Foreign Language Film, without ever taking home the award. Ephraim Kishon’s “Sallah Shabati” was the first nominee, in 1964, followed by Kishon’s “The Policeman” in 1971. But most of the films submitted by Israel (since 1991, the winner of the Ophir Award for Best Picture has automatically been submitted for Oscar contention) focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its wider implications, extending to wars in neighboring countries. These include Uri Barabash’s 1984 film “Behind the Walls,” Joseph Cedar’s “Beaufort” from 2007, and Ari Folman’s 2008 “Waltz with Bashir.”</p> \n<p>This shift in mood and interest may also be a factor right here in Israel. Just look at the top two Israeli films currently: Matan Yair’s “Scaffolding” and Ophir Raul Graizer’s “The Cakemaker.” Both are surprising box-office hits, whose directors were both likely taken aback by what an enthusiastic reception they’ve gotten. Both tell a small, human story about ordinary folks and have nothing to do with heroic or broken soldiers back from the battlefield. Both of these movies are quite European in terms of their direction, production and cinematography.</p> \n<p>Over the past decade, many of the winners in the Best Foreign Language Film, including Michael Haneke’s “Amour” and Paola Sorrentino’s “La Grande Bellezza,” seem to indicate that flashy Hollywood productions have become less appealing to Academy voters. One can’t help but wonder what would have happened had “Scaffolding” or “The Cakemaker” been submitted as Israel’s Oscar entry. Perhaps a movie like that would have been better able to break through.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ever since the police issued their summary report of two investigations concerning Benjamin Netanyahu, many people have been trying to solve one of the great riddles of Israeli politics: How is it that the poll numbers of the prime minister and his Likud party not only did not decline but even rose?</p> \n<p>It can’t be claimed that only one side of the political map cares about corruption. In 1977, claims of massive corruption at the highest levels contributed to voters’ disgust with the Labor Alignment that led to its ouster. And in 1992, anti-corruption demonstrations helped Yitzhak Rabin to beat Yitzhak Shamir. So what has changed?</p> \n<p>A number of Haaretz writers have weighed in. Yossi Klein cited Likud voters’ need for “revenge” against the elites (Feb. 22). Daniel Blatman proposed “fear” as an explanation for the lack of desire to separate from Netanyahu (Feb. 22, in Hebrew). Ravit Hecht cited the “familial” nature of Likud voters (Feb. 23). Alon Idan compared support for Likud to fans’ loyalty to a soccer team (Feb. 23, in Hebrew). Iris Leal claimed that Netanyahu “hypnotizes” his audience (Feb. 25, in Hebrew).</p> \n<p>The weakness of all these explanations lies in their common denominator. The key terms in these op-eds show that to his critics, support for Netanyahu is emotional. None of them sought to understand its rationale.</p> \n<p>This problem is most apparent in attempts to explain why the left has failed to convince the right: Persuasion is impossible from a position of fundamental arrogance, which assumes that “they” are not rational but “we” are. Yet a deeper look reveals, even if unintentionally, a real difficulty in understanding the other.</p> \n<p>This isn’t new. The late sociologist Yonathan Shapiro, who conducted one of the first studies on Likud’s rise to power, named several reasons for its upset victory in his book “The Road to Power: Herut Party in Israel.” One of the main ones, he said, was Likud leader Menachem Begin’s emotional manipulation of Mizrahi Jews.</p> \n<p>This claim was widely accepted as axiomatic for several decades, and still echoes through academic and public debates. The problem is that manipulation doesn’t work only on people of certain ethnic origins, and in any case, all politicians tend to manipulate.</p> \n<p>In fact, new studies about the economic policies of the ruling Mapai party, a Labor Party forerunner, during the country’s formative years show that until the 1960s, and contrary to its image as a party that exploited the Mizrahim, Mapai pursued a clear policy of reducing wage gaps between the elites and the lower classes. This data help us understand why Mizrahim abandoned Mapai at about that time and started voting for Begin, because it explains the economic and class context and recognizes that this was a rational decision.</p> \n<p>Haaretz Editor-in-Chief Aluf Benn wrote that Netanyahu’s accomplishments — Israel’s prosperity, its political stability and the decline in Palestinian terror within Israel proper — are what win him public support (Feb. 26). But Benn didn’t draw the necessary conclusion, which is that if Netanyahu’s achievements are what keep him in power, then the right is rational, and the left is emotional in its utter opposition to his policies.</p> \n<p>Clearly, the left-right story is more complicated than questions of emotionalism, and even those who recognize Netanyahu’s practical achievements can’t ignore his moral failings. Nevertheless, the people who shout “Only Bibi!” even when he is caught out in disgrace aren’t necessarily acting on gut instinct. On the contrary, they’re voicing rational recognition of the fact that for all the importance of the war against corruption in high places, it doesn’t affect their lives and won’t necessarily alter their situation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The international reactions to the Polish Holocaust law, and the present crisis in Israeli-Polish relations, offer an opportunity to reexamine the trips that Israeli teenagers make to the country. These trips began after the fall of the communist bloc, after Israelis were allowed to travel to Poland following decades of no diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p> \n<p>The idea was an understandable and correct one: Confront students from Israeli high schools directly with the terrible reality of the extermination camps built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. Prior to that, there were no such youth trips. Schools taught about the Holocaust for decades, but without trips to the concentration camps in Germany. One of the reasons was that many in Israel – and Holocaust survivors in particular – were deterred by visits to Germany.</p> \n<p>Trips to Poland – to Auschwitz, Majdanek or Treblinka – made it possible to illustrate the horrors of the Holocaust without visiting Germany, but he results were paradoxical and unexpected.</p> \n<p>All the trip participants heard lectures and briefings that described the extermination policy as a product of Nazi ideology and the Third Reich’s implementation of it in occupied Poland. But there’s a difference between a lecture and actually being present in a terrible place like Auschwitz. These trips were etched in people’s consciousness as “trips to Poland,” which is what they were called by the Education Ministry, rather than “trips to German extermination camps.” Unintentionally, tens of thousands of young Israelis associated the Holocaust with Poland, sometimes far more than with Nazi Germany.</p> \n<p>There were also instances of students returning from Poland were asked, for example, about the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and said that it was part of the fight against the Poles (after all, the ghetto was in Warsaw, wasn’t it?). There was a culture of anti-Semitism in pre-war Poland, and during the war many Poles handed over Jews to the Germans. These facts contributed to blurring the distinction between Nazi Germany’s systematic policy of extermination and the active cooperation of Polish citizens with the German murder machine.</p> \n<p>In addition, many of the teens who came to Poland didn’t know what distinguished Poland from other countries during World War II. Poland is the only European country that was totally dismantled by Nazi Germany. Its diplomatic, military, local, academic and educational institutions were destroyed while its territory was turned into an area of direct German occupation.</p> \n<p>The Germans even erased Poland’s name (the occupied region received the strange name General Government) and the seat of the German government was in Krakow rather than Warsaw. In all the other European countries there were collaborationist governments, or a local administration that obeyed the instructions of the German authorities. Only in Poland did the Germans murder 3 million non-Jewish citizens – in addition to 3 million Polish Jews – as part of their racist policy which considered Poles, like all Slavs, an inferior race.</p> \n<p>The time has come to change the structure of the student trips to Holocaust sites. The trip should begin in Germany, with visits to concentration camps such as Bergen-Belsen and Buchenwald. The students should be taught that the Nazi policy developed in stages: Until the outbreak of the war, tens of thousands of German citizens were imprisoned in concentration camps in Germany – Jews, socialists, communists, homosexuals; the rights and citizenship of German Jews were revoked, their property was confiscated and they were encouraged to emigrate.</p> \n<p>Only after a visit to the concentration camps in Germany itself should the trip continue to Poland and the extermination camps on its territory, as is the practice of Israeli army delegations to Holocaust sites. That way the Nazi policy will be presented in its correct historical and chronological contexts. During the visit to Poland, guides should mention not only the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, but the Polish uprising in Warsaw as well.</p> \n<p>The part played by Polish citizens who turned Jews over to the Germans should not be concealed. But groups should also discuss the heroism of thousands of Poles who rescued and hid Jews, at risk to their own lives, and were recognized by Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center. The murder of six million Jews by Nazi Germany is a unique and terrible event in European history, but it did not take place in a vacuum and was part of the totalitarian policy derived from the Nazis’ racist ideology.</p> \n<p>With all the justified criticism of the new Polish legislation, it’s important for Israeli teens to be exposed to the basic fact of the Holocaust: It was a product of German policy.</p> \n<p>There were those who collaborated with it – governments as well as individuals. This fact was recently well expressed by German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who unequivocally said that Germany and only Germany was responsible for the Holocaust. We must not forget that, and Israel’s education policy must not blur this historical fact and German responsibility – even if it happens unintentionally.</p>",

He said the figures are based on official data from the Israeli Interior Ministry not yet available to the public.</p> \n<p>According to his figures, the West Bank settler population reached 435,159 as of Jan. 1, up 3.4 percent from 420,899 a year earlier. The settler population has grown 21.4 percent in the last five years.</p> \n<p>In comparison, Israel's total population grew 1.8 percent to 8.743 million last year, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> \n<p>Katz said the rapid growth of the settlements should put to rest the idea of a two-state solution favored by the Palestinians and most of the international community.</p> \n<p>Based on recent growth patterns, he said the West Bank settler population could approach 500,000 by the time Trump leaves office. His study did not include the more than 200,000 Israelis now living in east Jerusalem, the Palestinians' hoped-for capital.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are changing the map,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea of the two-state solution is over. It is irreversible.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Palestinians seek the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, for a future independent state. Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Mideast war, though it withdrew from Gaza in 2005.</p> \n<p>A string of U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have endorsed the idea of a two-state solution and have joined the international community in opposing settlements as obstacles to peace.</p> \n<p>But after years of failed U.S.-led peace efforts, Trump has taken a different line. He says he would support a two-state solution only if both sides agree to it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nationalist coalition is dominated by settler allies who oppose Palestinian independence.</p> \n<p>Trump also has taken a softer stance toward the settlements, urging restraint at times but avoiding the strong condemnations of his predecessors. His ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is a former president of Bet El Institutions. His chief Mideast adviser, son-in-law Jared Kushner, has donated to the group, and even Trump once sent a donation.</p> \n<p>These deep ties to the settlements have helped fuel Palestinian suspicions of the White House. Those suspicions deepened after Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December, prompting the Palestinians to say the U.S. can no longer be an honest Mideast broker. Trump's team has been working on a peace proposal, though it is not clear when it will be released.</p> \n<p>Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said the figures reflect an Israeli policy of building settlements to destroy the two-state solution. He said Trump's muted response encourages more settlement building.</p> \n<p>&quot;What is required of the world, including the American administration, is to condemn the settlements as illegitimate and illegal and to recognize the principle of two states on the 1967 borders,&quot; he said. &quot;if they want to keep hope in any future peace process, they must stop these plans.&quot;</p> \n<p>Brian Reeves, spokesman for Peace Now, an anti-settlement monitoring group, said it could not corroborate Katz's figures but that they are in the &quot;ballpark&quot; of its own estimates.</p> \n<p>Katz said the settlement growth has been fueled both by natural growth of the population, which is heavily religious and tends to have larger families, as well as the attraction of cheaper housing in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>He predicted even faster growth in the coming years, claiming that the Trump White House has given Netanyahu a &quot;green light&quot; to advance construction.</p> \n<p>&quot;Bibi is less afraid of what the president will say about him,&quot; he said. &quot;We are very, very, very happy with the Trump administration.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Avigdor Feldman has recommended that you, David Grossman, refuse to accept the Israel Prize for literature, because you will have to shake hands with the prime minister, the education minister and the culture minister. Feldman suggests that instead, or perhaps as a reason, you see the exhibition of Moshe Gershuni in Tel Aviv and then go to the Supreme Court in Jerusalem, where you will hear about the refugees, the asylum seekers and the black American soldier.</p> \n<p>I propose a different journey, two in fact. One is surely familiar to you; the second is a journey among words rather than memories. Afterward — and maybe, as with Feldman, because of them — go and accept the prize, in part for those you visited.</p> \n<p>The first trip is a journey to love and loss — to your son Uri, whom you loved, and to Amir Meital, whom we loved, who was buried nearly 30 years ago in the military cemetery in Hadera. Between these two places you will find all the Uris and all the Amirs — all those who won’t be reading your books. Some of them surely read them already, and some may have left us without having read you at all.</p> \n<p>Your books, David Grossman, won’t awaken the Uris and the Amirs. Nor will the books of others, but this time you head the list of writers. Your books are the voice heard in the silence of the Uris and Amirs. They are the voice in which the sounds of joy and sorrow are also heard in the total silence of the cemetery; they are the memory of all those Uris and Amirs who will no longer dream, but in the final dreams of some of them, the characters that you created sang and danced and celebrated the dream that preceded the endless silence.</p> \n<p>It’s really superfluous to write this, but the Israel Prize is being granted to you, David Grossman, not in the name of the handshakers and not on their behalf. It is being granted to you in the name of those who are on this land, the readers and the silent ones. The hand that is doing the shaking is not even the frame of some painting by Gershuni, it is barely a small note in the corner. The prize is being awarded to you by those whom the painting depicts and those who are in it.</p> \n<p>That is the first journey that I’m proposing to you, to some of those for whom you are receiving the prize. The second journey is a verbal one. After the ceremony and after you shake everyone’s hands, you will certainly be given the opportunity to say thank you for the prize. Here you will be able to roam among your own words and to thank those because of whom and on whose behalf you really received the prize.</p> \n<p>If you allow me to sketch the “thank you journey” for you, Grossman, I propose a number of places for you: I suggest that you also thank the asylum seekers and their children for the prize. I imagine that some of them have read your children’s books and through them learned about this country, to which they arrived after a long period of wandering.</p> \n<p>I would suggest that you thank Shmuel Maoz and his film “Foxtrot,” and author Dorit Rabinyan and her book “All the Rivers,” in whose name, too, you are being awarded the prize.</p> \n<p>If there is anything that you, David Grossman, should understand well, and that Feldman apparently doesn’t understand, it’s that the government is not supposed to interfere in art. It was not the handshakers who decided to award you the prize, nor are you receiving it from their hands.

        "text":["<p>Nitzan Horowitz was good enough to write in the Hebrew edition of Haaretz this week about the daily battle among motorists to merge onto the Rokach Boulevard overpass in Tel Aviv. Horowitz thinks it’s all because of “the abandonment of the public space and systematic lack of enforcement.” Horowitz wants more police and more enforcement on the roads. He thinks it will change the situation and then he’ll be able to ease onto the overpass, with everyone patiently waiting their turn. Horowitz doesn’t know Israelis.</p> \n<p>There is no better place in which to become acquainted with Israelis’ character than on the roads. Fifteen minutes of driving teaches more than any anthropological study. Try merging into traffic at the Place de l’Etoile in Paris if you want to get to know the French. Get to know Egyptians by trying to cross the street near Cairo’s Tahrir Square. And go to a four-way stop at an intersection in Columbus, Ohio, where everybody waits their turn, if you want to know the American Midwest. Look how Swedes manage to wait in line in their cars as they board a ferry if you want to know Scandinavia. And witness Germans whizzing by in exemplary precision on the autobahn to know Germany.</p> \n<p>“The Israeli is no uglier than a Frenchman under pressure or a nervous American,” wrote Horowitz, who, unlike me, has spent several years abroad. Still, I dare say that he is wrong. Swedes don’t obey the law when they drive because of the police. British people aren’t polite on the road because of hidden cameras. The road represents a microcosm of all the collective national urges and values and language and morals. In a word, culture.</p> \n<p>The Israeli road makes you feel bad, but not because the police aren’t present on it. There aren’t a lot of experiences in Israel that are tougher than driving the country’s roads. Constant tension. Hesitate for a second and you’ll get a chorus of car horns blaring furiously. Stop on the road for a moment and the gates of hell open up. Signaling turns is for suckers. Why signal? What, who died? Giving the right of way is a sign of weakness. Leaving room for another car to park is an art installation.</p> \n<p>No policeman will change that. Nor will any police cruiser. All the Israeli aggression and violence and total lack of consideration for the other, any other, the bitterness and maybe even the hatred are reflected on the asphalt of Israel’s roads. And why has Israel become a country of jeeps? Because they’re the biggest and strongest. The highest and most heavy-handed, the way we like it. Even well-meaning, nerdy types turn into hateful monsters on the Israeli road, and it has nothing to do with enforcement of the law.</p> \n<p>Israelis have quit a lot of their old habits, from picking wildflowers to strewing sunflower seed shells on the floor of the movie theater, to sticking gum under their seats, to smoking in restaurants, to sneaking into movies – and not because they’re afraid of getting caught.</p> \n<p>In our childhood, there were inspectors galore, but we still smoked at the movies, with our cigarettes between our legs. “I saw a flashlight; that means an inspector has come in; which means that we’re going to be fined,” go the lyrics to the old song “Cinema Gashash.” And we laughed.</p> \n<p>It stopped, because Israel changed. It wasn’t a change handed down from above. Society recognized these habits as wrong, as something you just don’t do. It was more effective than any enforcement.</p> \n<p>On the country’s roads, the opposite is true. The road is the Israeli’s alter ego. Anything goes on the road. An army of police won’t stop it. The watchword on the road is, Don’t be a sucker, which is the essence of being Israeli. Not being a sucker is the supreme value. If you wait your turn to get onto the Rokach overpass, you’re a sucker. But if you cut in at the head of the line of cars, you’re no one’s sucker. If you station a policeman on Rokach, Israelis will detour to the Ayalon highway. Put a camera on the freeway and Israelis will get off before they reach it. The strictest enforcement won’t change the national character.</p> \n<p>Israelis who’ll rush to help a woman who’s fallen on the sidewalk will threaten to ram into her car if she’s driving too slowly. Israelis who would volunteer to rescue earthquake survivors in Kamchatka won’t let a driver in his 90s merge into their lane, and to hell with the courts. All of the hate and frustration comes out on the road. Try us. Watch Israelis drive in another country and see how we change in a matter of minutes. And it’s not from fear of a Swedish policeman.</p>",

Other Democratic lawmakers also criticized it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cardin and Portman originally rejected the ACLU's criticism. They claimed that the penalties mentioned in the bill won't apply to American citizens that choose to boycott Israel or the settlements because of politics, religious or personal reasons.</p> \n<p>Instead, they said, only corporations that knowingly take part in a boycott orchestrated by an international body such as the UN, could pay fines or face other penalties under the new bill.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last week, however, just before the opening of the annual AIPAC conference in Washington, Senators Cardin and Portman released a joint statement about amending the bill, in light of the criticism it had drawn from the ACLU and other civil rights groups.</p> \n<p>Cardin was particularly receiving strong criticism from within the Democratic Party for his leading role in promoting the bill.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In their statement, the two senators said that among the changes in the bill there would be &quot;legislative affirmation that nothing in the Act should be construed to diminish or infringe on any right protected under the First Amendment,&quot; and added that &quot;a clarification that a person’s noncommercial speech or other noncommercial expressive activity cannot be used as evidence to prove a violation.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ACLU said on Tuesday that while there have been &quot;several significant improvements&quot; as a result of a &quot;sincere effort&quot; by the senators, the organization still views the bill as &quot;overreaching&quot; and that it harms &quot;a core political expression.&quot;</p> \n<p>The ACLU also said that &quot;the bill's fundamental purpose violates the First Amendment,&quot; which is the main reason the organization continues to oppose it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It's unclear yet how the ACLU's position will impact the next stages of debate over the bill.</p> \n<p>The ACLU's original opposition slowed down the bill's progress, and eventually led Cardin and Portman to offer their amendments.</p> \n<p>AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups are interested in promoting the legislation with a clear bi-partisan consensus, mainly because they are concerned over growing support for BDS and boycotts against settlements within the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Talking to: Orly Noy, 47, lives in Jerusalem; political activist, editor on the political website Local Call, translator. Where: A Tel Aviv caf. When: Monday, 10 A.M.</p> \n<p>You left Iran with your family at the age of 9, but are still an Iranian citizen. In fact, Iranian citizenship cannot be relinquished.</p> \n<p>From the standpoint of the authorities there, the fact that I left Iran doesn’t mean that I stopped being a citizen. I could also go back there, but it would be a one-way ticket. I wouldn’t be allowed to return to Israel.</p> \n<p>You’re still connected to the events there, updated.</p> \n<p>I follow what happens there closely, through the social networks, through my Iranian friends and through relatives who still live there. Israelis find it very peculiar that Jews live in Iran, but for them it’s peculiar to want to live in Israel. [My relatives'] economic situation is excellent, so they don’t have to cope with the tremendous difficulties the middle class in Iran is experiencing.</p> \n<p>So they didn’t join the middle-class demonstrators. Tell me a little about the demonstrators’ situation.</p> \n<p>The cost of living in Iran is unbearable. Families in which both spouses work simply can’t get through the month. The middle class suffered the most difficult blow in the past decade, its condition deteriorated significantly, more than that of the upper and lower classes.</p> \n<p>There’s an index of the price of eggs as an indicator of the cost of living.</p> \n<p>When we left Iran, in 1979, one dollar was worth seven toman. That was always its value, and on one occasion, under the shah, when its value rose to nine toman, people took to the streets. At present, the exchange rate is 4,300 toman per dollar. That’s the scale of the inflation since the revolution. The price of eggs became a symbol of the erosion in purchasing power. A carton of eggs costs between $3 and $5. A clerk earns about $200 a month, so for poor people it’s not relevant. The rich can buy whatever they wish on the black market, the middle class has to leave eggs and many other items out of their menu. There are also a great many basic commodities that are simply missing. You can only get them with government coupons.</p> \n<p>There are all kinds of conspiracy theories about the recent protests. Some claim it was actually a plot by the authorities.</p> \n<p>From what I’ve heard and know, that’s total nonsense. The protest started in Mashhad, which is actually a religious city. It spread very rapidly and reached places like Qom and Khomeyn. Who would have imagined that there would be protests in Khomeyn – the city of Khomeini himself?</p> \n<p>Did the previous wave of protests, in 2009, skip those cities?</p> \n<p>Yes. The 2009 protest was completely different. It was a protest of the “bourgeois and secular,” as far as it can be defined like that. The current protest comes directly from below.</p> \n<p>The cause of the previous protest was clear and political; the present one has quite a few causes.</p> \n<p>I think that this protest genuinely represents a kind of general disgust with the situation. A large segment of the urban middle class espouses views and values that are very far from those of the government. They follow Western news and culture via the underground, and want greater openness to the world. They don’t want to live in a country where a man and a woman who live together [unmarried] can be arrested and get into serious trouble with the law. They want to be able to find a job after university, and not have to contend with the rampant unemployment that exists in Iran. That’s a pressure cooker, some of whose steam was released in the recent wave of demonstrations. Of course, there were additional triggers, such as the collapse of the pension funds. Think of people who busted their butts their entire lives, worked until age 60-plus, and find themselves facing catastrophe.</p> \n<p>There’s also great anger at Iran’s involvement in wars outside its territory – in Yemen, Syria.</p> \n<p>There’s tremendous anger and bitterness over the fact that, while the Iranian economy is sinking into the depths, the state is spending huge amounts abroad. Most of the slogans that were chanted in the protests were absolutely connected to that. For example, “Not Gaza and not Lebanon, my soul is bound only to Iran.” According to this view, the state is wasting money on Hezbollah and Hamas while its own citizens are suffocating. That’s a civil dialogue that also touches on the Iranians’ historical grudge against the Arab states. They say to themselves: Excuse me, but what do we have to do with those Arabs, anyway?</p> \n<p>Let the Arabs kill one another.</p> \n<p>My father told me that in 1967, when Israel was victorious in the Six-Day War, his customers brought him flowers and sweets, and congratulated him warmly. The Iranians were very pleased that the Israelis had succeeded in screwing the Arabs.</p> \n<p>The signing of the nuclear agreement and the easing of sanctions was supposed to bring a better life. Those expectations were disappointed.</p> \n<p>There has been a certain improvement – inflation is down and purchasing power is up, but the public expected much more The Iranians, somewhat like the Israelis, believe and feel that their country, too, is destined for greatness – that, in a certain sense, they are a chosen people and that their present low point is a deviation from the course of a country that should be and needs to be in the league of the world’s strong and great states. All the media coverage after the signing of the agreement dealt with the idea that Iran could now return to its rightful place and rehabilitate its economy – but that didn’t happen.</p> \n<p>If I were in power, I would have seen that excitement in the wake of the agreement as the sparks of the next protest.</p> \n<p>Absolutely. The expectations that were shattered and the continuing suppression are the two forces that generated the protest. Now, you have to understand that Iran has a kind of two-layer culture, a double life. Outwardly, people are obedient citizens of the regime, but internally, there’s a prevailing culture of hard-drug use, consumption of Western cultural content and also truly subversive stuff. Iran has a drug problem, which is one of its most serious social problems today. According to official state data, there are about two million “deep” drug addicts and another million users [among a population of 80 million]. The age of addiction is declining all the time, and more and more women are entering the hard-drug cycle, especially with opium and heroin. It’s also happening in the most affluent neighborhoods.</p> \n<p>The authorities are trying to deal with it, but unsuccessfully. Now they’re talking about no longer executing people for drug offenses, which could save the lives of thousands of prisoners now in jail. Iranian authorities note that the high unemployment rate is the central cause of the drug problem, and is pressing for rehab programs and preventive education. There is also prostitution in Iran, and that phenomenon is spreading, too.</p> \n<p>Really? Sounds totally off the wall.</p> \n<p>Iran has the death penalty for prostitution, and in the past, women have been executed for it, and on charges of pimping and running a brothel. But the economic plight nourishes this situation, and teens and young girls are entering the prostitution cycle. Under Shi’ite religious law, there’s an institution known as “temporary marriage.” The male is allowed to marry as many temporary wives as he wishes on the basis of a contract that stipulates the duration of the bond. If the morality police detain a man and a woman who were caught cohabiting, they can present the temporary marriage document and stay out of trouble.</p> \n<p>In practice, that’s a convenient outlet for the prostitution phenomenon, which has grown frighteningly in the past few decades. There is also “classic” prostitution, of course. Brothels are flourishing in Tehran throughout the underground world of clubs, sex and drugs. The industry of importing and exporting women for prostitution is also prospering – the export of young Iranian women for purposes of prostitution mainly to the Gulf states, and the import to Iran of other young women, mostly Afghans.</p> \n<p>Awful. More optimistically, you often write about the role of women in propelling revolutions.</p> \n<p>If there’s one population group that’s proving a challenge to the regime, and showing up its limitations systematically, it’s women. Women have always taken part in political developments in modern Iran, including the 1979 revolution, in part because of Khomeini’s promises of gender equality. I remember the women demonstrating alongside men in 1978, or the young woman with a head covering who burst into our house in the midst of the demonstrations and begged my mother to hide her, because the shah’s police were in hot pursuit of her.</p> \n<p>After the victory of the revolution, Iran really was a kind of open paradise, liberal and pluralistic to a point, for a few months. But it all faded soon afterward, when the government imposed a strict, conservative line. Since then, the women have been in a constant struggle to change the status quo. If you look at photos of Iran from 20 years ago, 10 years ago and now, you’ll see the makeup, the fingernail polish. Those sound like trivial matters, but they are the result of a persistent struggle. It’s not trivial to go out into the street wearing lipstick or sunglasses, when the morality guards are out there – at first they threw acid into the faces of women with makeup.</p> \n<p>Probably the image from those the recent protests that will remain burned into the consciousness is the one of the teenage girl waving her head covering in the face of policemen.</p> \n<p>In the past few years, there were at least two viral campaigns about head coverings. One was “Our Secret Freedoms,” in which women in Iran photographed themselves bareheaded in all kinds of places and uploaded the images. The other was “White Wednesdays,” in which on every Wednesday women wore a white kerchief outside the home to protest the imposition of the hijab. The girl who flaunted the white kerchief was probably taking part in that campaign. Young women in Iran turned the country upside down to protest the ban against entering stadiums and watching sports events – especially when Iranian teams reached international tournaments, such as the soccer World Cup. Women have been making achievements in all these arenas, even if at a snail’s pace and not by revolution.</p> \n<p>Women are also incarcerated as political prisoners.</p> \n<p>There are quite a few female political prisoners in Iran, particularly in the notorious Evin Prison, in a separate wing, of course. Officially, Iran doesn’t execute political prisoners, but of course there have been numerous executions of that kind over the years. Two of the most famous female political prisoners have been the lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and has since left Iran, and Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human rights activist. She represented many of the detainees in the Green Wave of 2009, was arrested herself, launched a hunger strike in prison, and now that she is out, is continuing her political activity courageously.</p> \n<p>Female political prisoners speak of a tough hand, humiliations, body searches, rape by male warders ... Beyond separation from their family and children, harsh sanctions are imposed on all members of the family: surveillance, detentions, interrogations and the like.</p> \n<p>Everyone can find himself in prison, on any pretext.</p> \n<p>The government’s courts are not accountable to anyone, they can lock people up for no reason. For an article in the paper you can get months or years, and also be executed, of course. Protectors of human rights in Iran have a website where you can see who’s been arrested, and why. For example, an educator couple who were sent to prison for launching an Arabic study group.</p> \n<p>Why?</p> \n<p>Because it’s considered subversive to teach Arabic, and apparently they were also alleged to have some kind of political agenda. Some of the poets whom I translate are constantly in and out of jail.</p> \n<p>I read a protest poem you translated and posted on your Facebook page, and I asked myself whether the brave man who wrote it is in prison.</p> \n<p>He certainly is. That specific poet, Mohammad Reza Ali Payam, wrote something that the authorities really disliked. He was warned that if he dared to recite the poem even once at a public event, he would be jailed. So he came to a poetry-reading evening with a packed bag, ready for prison, read out the poem and was of course arrested. In jail he wrote more poems. Almost all the young poets I translate were in prison at some stage.</p> \n<p>That’s a courageous act. I don’t see anyone in Israel being ready to go to jail in order to read a poem.</p> \n<p>That’s why I’m a lot more optimistic about the future of Iran than I am about the future of Israel. Because in Iran – and this is a generalization, of course – the public is engaged in a search for the right path, while in Israel, also this is a generalization, the public is engaged in justifying the path. In Iran they’re aware of their sorry state and are constantly occupied with how to improve it and how to extricate themselves from it. It really is a completely different type of civil consciousness.</p> \n<p>It’s also interesting how Iran is perceived by Israelis. For example, many here think Iranians are Arabs.</p> \n<p>Of course. The view of Iran is orientalist and instrumental. In the best case, it was seen as a rich kingdom, and in the worst, Iran was included in the Arab world. From the Israeli viewpoint, during the period of the shah it was a country to do business with and to train its secret police, but they showed no interest in the culture of the cradle of Eastern civilization.</p> \n<p>Israel tends to show no curiosity about other cultures.</p> \n<p>Iranian culture was perceived as inferior, like all Eastern cultures. What’s really funny is that the Iranians themselves lord it so much over the Arabs. To this day, they consider the Arab conquest a barbarian takeover of their wonderful culture. When I first arrived in Israel, I was asked all the time whether I had lived in a real house, whether I’d ever seen an elevator, and this was in the 1970s, when Tehran was dozens of times more advanced than Israel.</p> \n<p>What do you remember from Iran?</p> \n<p>We were urban Jewish middle class. My father was a bank manager, my mother a homemaker. My brother and I attended a Jewish school. You’re very aware of your Jewishness, even though we were a secular family. My last memories are of the revolution, of course.</p> \n<p>You left on the very eve of the revolution.</p> \n<p>We left Iran on the evening the shah fled the country [in 1978]. Khomeni arrived about two weeks later. At the airport we saw the headlines in the papers: “The shah is gone.” The demonstrations started two months later. My parents had started to talk about it at home. As a child, you only take in a little, of course, but we felt that something was going on, that there was pressure. My parents sold our beautiful house and we moved to a rented apartment. That was just a month or two before we left. The schools were already closed. The streets were simply a walking black mass of demonstrators, with pictures of Khomeini.</p> \n<p>One night it was said that his image would appear on the moon, and the next day, millions of people swore that they’d seen Khomeini’s picture on the full moon. I remember that one night we went out with my parents for a stroll. They bought us laboo, which is a kind of sweet beet dish, and we passed by the bank branch that my father managed. We saw demonstrators break into the bank, smash everything and then set it on fire. That was probably the moment that my father said to himself, ‘Fine, it’s over.’ We left from one day to the next.</p> \n<p>Crude cut to the present. What do you hear now, after the protest movement has died down?</p> \n<p>The protest has died down, but it hasn’t failed. I see it as another chapter in the ongoing negotiations that the Iranian nation has conducted with the government since the 1979 revolution. Some of the concrete demands were met, such as the matter of the pension funds, and things have been made easier for women in some ways in the public sphere. This wave wasn’t broad and deep enough to constitute the basis for a genuine revolution. It didn’t include sweeping general strikes, there was barely any real violence on the part of the demonstrators, and it didn’t arouse the many persecuted ethnic minorities in Iran.</p> \n<p>We’re likely to see more waves like it in the years ahead, especially in connection with the next presidential election and the approval of the opposition’s candidates by the Guardian Council of the Constitution, and of course if the economic situation gets even worse. By the way, anyone who thinks that sanctions against the Iranian government in connection with the nuclear issue will spur the Iranian people to rise up against their government, should think again. Because, despite the deep criticism of the government, when it comes to the nuclear matter, there is sweeping consensus in Iran. The Iranians see it [having nuclear power] as their natural right, irrespective of the character of the regime.</p> \n<p>Tell that to Benjamin Netanyahu, who expressed total support for the demonstrators.</p> \n<p>I found what he said almost despicable.</p> \n<p>It was certainly cynical.</p> \n<p>Of course. After all, he understands very well that his support serves the government directly – the regime always claims that the protest was born in the wake of the involvement of anti-Iranian elements who want to fire up the people. You have to understand that the Iranians are always ready to believe that there’s external intervention in their domestic affairs.</p> \n<p>They undoubtedly remember how intervention of that kind toppled the government.</p> \n<p>In 1953, the United States toppled the [Mohammad] Mossadegh government – which was the great hope for reform and democracy in Iran – for political interests. That is totally fresh in the Iranians’ memory, so when [Ayatollah] Ali Khamenei and [President] Hassan Rohani talk to them about foreign intervention, it doesn’t fall on deaf ears. And then comes Netanyahu and supposedly supports the Iranian people, after trying in every way possible to torpedo the nuclear agreement that the Iranian public waited for so expectantly. What exactly is that support supposed to achieve? To strengthen the people?</p> \n<p>Mainly to strengthen Netanyahu’s Facebook page.</p> \n<p>The truth is that the Iranians take no notice of him. There was a lot of dialogue on the social networks about the declarations by [U.S. President] Donald Trump, but Netanyahu’s declaration stirred no interest. You’re talking about listening to a nation that’s taken to the streets? Maybe you should open the window and listen to your own people.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the corruption whirlwind of the past few weeks, who even had time to respond seriously to war crimes in the territories, among them the recent incident in Jericho? We’re talking about another episode that was pushed to the margins and faded away among the army’s varying and vague versions of events – all aimed at avoiding prosecution of the Israel Defense Forces soldiers who were filmed beating and abusing a wounded Palestinian whom one of them had shot.</p> \n<p>Yasin al-Saradih, a 36-year-old Palestinian, was shot on February 22 when he tried to attack a group of soldiers with the rim of a car wheel with an iron bar stuck through it. He was immobilized and no longer posed a threat to the armed soldiers. But this didn’t stop them from attacking a man wallowing in his own blood, beating and dragging him into a nearby alley. For half an hour he lay there with no medical assistance before being evacuated, after one of the soldiers fired a tear-gas canister into the alley where he lay.</p> \n<p>It isn’t clear what Saradih’s condition was at that point. The National Center of Forensic Medicine at Abu Kabir determined that the direct cause of his death was the gunshot wound. That may be true, but he was still alive after he’d been shot. How much did the abuse contribute to his death, along with the fact that he was left like a stinking carcass with no medical attention? No one has provided an answer.</p> \n<p>In a routine series of events, a group of paratroopers confiscated a vehicle from a Palestinian and turned the children sitting in the back into a live, human shield against the stones being thrown at it.</p> \n<p>The heroes of the Border Police rolled a stun grenade at a man fleeing with his baby in his arms; the IDF, as usual, ruled that this was against regulations and was investigating.</p> \n<p>The IDF also recently examined the case of Mohammed Tamimi, half of whose skull was crushed by a rubber-coated bullet, and decided that he’d been hurt when he fell off his bicycle.</p> \n<p>The army had previously looked into the incident involving legless demonstrator, Ibrahim Abu Thuraya, who was in a wheelchair when he was shot and killed on the other side of the fence along the Israel-Gaza Strip border. It was decided that he was inciting and posed a security threat. In addition, the IDF investigated the case of the Gazan fisherman, Ismail Abu Riala, who strayed beyond the border of the marine ghetto – an original Israeli invention – whereupon the brave navy men shot him from their sophisticated patrol boat. Everything was investigated and no one is to blame for anything.</p> \n<p>These actions have a name: They are war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under the Geneva Convention the definition of such crimes includes political, racist or religious persecution and/or other inhuman treatment. Under the Rome Statute, the basis for the establishment of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, “war crime” is a generic term that refers to those sorts of actions during an armed conflict. Crimes against humanity, the convention says, are events that constitute part of a government policy (although the perpetrators don’t necessarily have to identify with this policy), or involve a widespread practice of perpetrating atrocities by a government or an authority acting de facto on its behalf.</p> \n<p>A war crime is especially serious when there is a directive behind it. For example, the murderous violence of the Japanese army against American and Australian soldiers during World War II, or against the civilian population in China and Korea. But there is also a situation, like that in the territories, in which soldiers commit war crimes without receiving instructions from the political echelon or the approval of the military command; the army then evades dealing with them and covers them up.</p> \n<p>Every discussion of IDF ethics must take the army’s response into account. But the real problem is not the evasiveness of the IDF, whose version of events is treated as God’s living word only in Israel, which is rife with anti-Arab racism. What’s important is that these acts have become the norm. They are committed time after time without provoking barely any public or internal army debate.</p> \n<p>The IDF is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, and most of the perpetrators are never called to account. In the colonialist reality in which the army operates these are routine practices against a population that is subject to dehumanization. The IDF sees its soldiers as belonging to a different “level of civilization.” After all, the colonial officer cannot share the same universal moral values as the native who attacks him with a knife. Therefore, there is continued chatter here about “the most moral army in the world” – the product of a dichotomy that Israel makes between what the international community has determined is a war crime, and its struggle against a people that it sees as not subject to the ethical rules shared by civilized nations.</p> \n<p>How do we get out of this? Israel uses demagoguery that rejects acts of “exceptional” violence against Palestinians, but avoids severely punishing the “exceptions,” which it claims are only those caught on B’tselem’s cameras. Obviously there’s nothing serious to discuss about dealing with most of these atrocities.</p> \n<p>What happens to an army where a norm of war crimes has been established for so many years? What will happen if this army is ordered by an extremist regime to carry out ethnic cleansing and expel hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Jordan or Lebanon? How will the soldiers, who now kick a wounded Palestinian, respond when told to shoot at the thousands who oppose the move? Does anyone in the IDF believe that its soldiers won’t execute these missions?</p> \n<p>Prof. Daniel Blatman is a historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the sea of stupidity into which Israeli society is slowly sinking, the response of Ahed Tamimi’s father to the secret discussion in the Knesset initiated two years ago by Deputy Minister Michael Oren was like a life preserver of wisdom. “How did such a fool get to be your ambassador to the United States?” Bassem Tamimi asked with mock concern. “How does the State of Israel allow such a thing?” Good question.</p> \n<p>Out of respect for Oren, it’s best not to go into details. The entire discussion is ridiculous and it would be embarrassing to disclose the details. In his defense, it must be said that he’s not alone. In retrospect, it seems obvious that in a place where the Palestinian people is denied, the Palestinian family is also denied. Life in Israel has become a kind of intellectual torture: Everyone talks nonsense and it’s impossible to disconnect.</p> \n<p>“Israel should not give a platform to a drunk who compares a girl who was murdered in the Holocaust and a heroine who battled the Nazi regime to Ahed Tamimi, a punk who assaulted a solider,” said Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. Fuming over the comparison that author and songwriter Yehonatan Geffen made between Ahed Tamimi and Anne Frank and Hannah Szenes, Lieberman directed Army Radio to ban him and called on all media outlets to do the same.</p> \n<p>As if in a ritual, the attorney general soon issued a statement to clean up the mess left by Lieberman’s slip of the tongue: the defense minister, he said, does not have the authority to interfere with the station’s content. How did such a rude, violent, ultranationalist get to be defense minister? How does Israel allow such a thing?</p> \n<p>And in all that silly ruckus, no one stopped to ask whether it’s okay to compare Anne Frank with Hannah Szenes. What do they have in common? And we really should discuss the meager reservoir of metaphors being fostered by Israel’s intellectual elite. Tamimi struck home with this one: “If that’s your elite, I’m not sure how you manage to beat us.”</p> \n<p>Because as admirable, hope-inspiring and just is the political awakening among the elite of opponents to the deportation of asylum seekers, it comes with a slight sense of discomfort at the fact that these protesters have been captivated by the comparison to the Holocaust. After all, if the asylum seekers are Jews persecuted by the Nazis, what do the signatories of the petitions think that makes them: Schindler? Janusz Korczak?</p> \n<p>In response to the political persecution, Israeli entertainer Gidi Gov became irritated that a new immigrant with a Russian accent dared turn Geffen, the sabra scion of that dynasty of local nobility, the Dayans, into an enemy of Israel.</p> \n<p>If the Law of Return frustrates Gov, we can only imagine the rage it evokes in native-born Arabs. Gov doesn’t need it explained to him that he was a bit racist, he himself prefaced his statement with a reservation and also apologized for it. In another country — Canada? Sweden? His words might have drawn a moralistic reprimand. But in Israel in 2018? In a week where the culture minister posts a clip on Facebook where she is embraced by fans of the Beitar soccer team singing “Let their village burn,” referring to the fans of the team from the Arab town of Sakhnin?</p> \n<p>Does MK Yulia Malinovsky of Yisrael Beiteinu — an extreme right-wing party that calls for the boycott and transfer of 20 percent of Israel’s citizens — have any right to protest racism? And can the justice minister, who is promoting the apartheid revolution, defend the “Russian aliyah”? Who are they kidding? Who believes their lies? Enough already. You’re either thugs or crybabies.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“I took thousands of pictures, and I kept on taking more and more pictures, for a later time, for posterity,” said Zvi Kadushin shortly before his death in 1997. A half-century earlier, Kadushin, an amateur photographer from Kovno, Lithuania, secretly took a raft of photos in the ghetto there, which was built in 1941 and liquidated three years later. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>His work as an X-ray technician at a German military hospital gave him access to photography equipment and the means to develop pictures. He also came up with techniques for covertly taking photos through his clothes. He hid the pictures, and himself, before the ghetto was liquidated and its captives killed. Thanks to his efforts, many of his photographs survived the war, and he later showed them around the world.</p> \n<p>Now some of these photos can been seen in an exhibition that just opened at Yad Vashem, “Flashes of Memory,” curated by Vivian Uria. The Holocaust photos are divided into three main categories based on the person who wielded the camera: Germans, Jews, and Americans or Soviets. In other words, the murderers, the victims and the liberators.</p> \n<p>Each had their own reasons for pulling out a camera, whether it was a professional expensive one or a simple amateur model. The exhibition shows just how slippery the term “propaganda” can be. Alongside the photos staged by the Nazis, both of the “master race” as filmed by Leni Riefenstahl for Hitler and of the “inferior” Jews as depicted in the magazine Der St&uuml;rmer, are photographs staged by the Soviets after the liberation of the camps.</p> \n<p>Especially notable are the pictures of Jewish prisoners from Auschwitz, who were brought back there after the liberation to stand before the cameras of the Soviet Army. According to the exhibition’s catalog, since photographers weren’t present at the liberation on January 27, 1945, a week later the Soviets reenacted the event.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, not only the Nazis but also the Americans and Russians took photographs during the Holocaust for press and propaganda purposes, including for use in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals, and in the re-education of the people of occupied Germany.</p> \n<p>Some pictures in the exhibition can’t be easily categorized; for example, the photos by German soldiers, police officers or ordinary citizens who weren’t taking pictures for anyone else. Some came to the ghettos because of their work. Others just happened to pass by. For many of them, the ghettos were a startling sight that made them reach for their cameras.  German readers send in photos  In these photographs, the camera captures the Nazi brutality to which the Jewish prisoners were subjected, not just the “unproductive Jews” whom the Nazis sought to portray in their propaganda. One photo shows a woman and three children in the Warsaw Ghetto. The photo credit reads: “A personal photograph taken by an unidentified German.”</p> \n<p>German SS man Heinz Jost is credited with several hard-to-look-at photos, including one of a Jewish boy lying on the ground in the Warsaw Ghetto. Another is of two children in the ghetto – a boy lying on the ground dead or near it, and a girl holding him.</p> \n<p>A different group of private photographs was originally published by Der St&uuml;rmer, which encouraged readers to send in anti-Semitic material that would be published in its letters-to-the-editor section. Readers rose to the challenge and sent in photographs and accompanying text.</p> \n<p>“This is how they idly roam the streets of Lublin,” wrote Ernst M&uuml;ller from Vienna. “The eternal Jew! See how he goes around in the world endangering humanity” was the caption on the back of a photo sent in by Cpl. Albert Glass. “This is how we deloused the Jews in Poland,” an unnamed private wrote on the back of a photograph.</p> \n<p>Besides Germans, some Jews – not many, to be sure – had permission to take photos. Such was the case with the photographers of the Judenrat in the Lodz Ghetto, the second-largest ghetto after the Warsaw Ghetto.</p> \n<p>Chaim Rumkowski, the head of the Judenrat in Lodz, wanted to show the Germans&nbsp; the ghetto’s economic prowess so that they wouldn’t liquidate the place. To that end, he hired two professional Jewish photographers named Mendel Grossman and Henryk Ross.</p> \n<p>The two worked in the ghetto’s statistics department; their job was to take pictures for the reports written by the department. But they – as well as Aryeh Ben-Menachem, Grossman’s assistant – also took a lot of photos outside their job, in direct violation of Rumkowski’s orders.</p> \n<p>“Because I had a camera as part of my official job, I could capture the whole tragic time of the Lodz Ghetto. I did it knowing that if I were caught, my family and I would be tortured and killed,” Ross later said.</p> \n<p>Also shown in the exhibition is a page from an underground photo album put together by Ben-Menachem in 1943. It shows the travails of ghetto life, the kind of thing that didn’t appear in the official Judenrat reports and albums. One page shows Rumkowski and unsparing photos of deportations and dead bodies. The full album did not survive. All that is left are reproductions made by the Polish underground.  The eyes of the victims  Also on display is a letter dated December 8, 1941 that Rumkowski sent to Grossman. He wrote: “I hereby inform you that it is prohibited for you to engage in your occupation for personal purposes ....&nbsp; From now on, the photography work will be limited to the department in which you work. All other photography activity is strictly prohibited.”</p> \n<p>Grossman did not survive the Holocaust. Yad Vashem director Avner Shalev writes in the preface to the exhibition catalog that Grossman was both a victim and the eyes of the victims, noting that Grossman preserved human dignity in his images of the Lodz Ghetto. These included the dying days of his relatives – his brother-in-law eating a bowl of soup at the end of a day of labor, his father wrapped in a prayer shawl and praying for the last time, his young nephew chewing on a carrot.</p> \n<p>Uria, the curator, says that while some may argue that photography provides a narrow “selective reconstruction” of reality, “bear in mind that photographs provide incontrovertible testimony that a given incident did in fact happen.”</p> \n<p>As she puts it, “Photography doesn’t invent an event, it serves as evidence of its existence. The manner of photography can distort the picture presented, but there is no question that the thing seen in the photograph existed at the time the photo was taken.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Her words are echoed by a quote from the 1942 diary of Rokhl Auerbakh, a Holocaust survivor and Polish Jewish writer who directed Yad Vashem’s Department for the Collection of Witness Testimony in the 1950s and ‘60s.</p> \n<p>“Let them film, let them film as much as possible so a filmed record will remain of the situation to which they have brought a community of 400,000 Jews,” she wrote, referring to the German photographers. “They have the ability to create such a record. The editing, the interpretation – those aren’t important,” she added.</p> \n<p>“But let there remain on film, even in snatches, the faces of the Jewish passersby from the dim streets. The faces, the eyes that in the years to come will silently shout out the truth. May the masses of beggars be remembered, the people of yesterday dying a slow death from poverty and hunger in the closed ghetto.”</p> \n<p>Nearly 1,500 images are displayed in the exhibition, and the ones by Jews can be seen as an answer to the sole Nazi victory in the war – the vast photographic and cinematic record they left behind.</p> \n<p>“The German-produced visual materials, much of which were created for propaganda purposes, played a large part in shaping the visual imagery of the events of World War II, including the Holocaust,” says&nbsp; Daniel Uziel, the head of Yad Vashem’s photo-collection section and the historical adviser for the exhibition.</p> \n<p>“Even now, for the purpose of a historic visual representation of the Holocaust, one cannot avoid relying to a large extent on German material, including material that was created for anti-Semitic propaganda purposes.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Michael Sfard likes to say that “The Wall and the Gate” was born on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv Highway. The human rights attorney’s new book, which is subtitled “Israel, Palestine, and the Legal Battle for Human Rights” (Metropolitan/Holt Books; 526 pages; $35), deals with the history of Israeli litigation on behalf of the Palestinians over a half-century of occupation. For about half of that time, Sfard has been one of the key players in this drama, representing Palestinian individuals and communities in challenging the expropriation and theft of their lands, attempted deportations, Israeli torture and administrative detention of “terror” suspects.</p> \n<p>It was during the hundreds of drives back from the capital, after appearing before the Supreme Court, that, Sfard says, “all the tension that comes along with a hearing and with litigating evaporates, and I could unwind and begin thinking, okay, what have I accomplished today?”</p> \n<p>For a long time Sfard had been aware of a dissonance between his goal of attaining relief for individual Palestinian clients and his desire to force a change in Israeli policies. A telling example is his most dramatic legal victory, when in 2007 the High Court rejected the state’s claim that the route of one segment of the security barrier erected during the second intifada had been based solely on security considerations. Instead, it accepted Sfard’s argument that the authorities had allowed the desire to include more West Bank land for settlements within the Israeli side of the wall to prevail, even to the detriment of security-military needs.</p> \n<p>The 2007 case involved the encroachment of the barrier on the Palestinian village of Bil’in to allow for the planned construction of a new neighborhood in the adjacent Jewish settlement of Modi’in Ilit. Although the court did not accept the claim of Sfard and his colleagues that the very construction of the barrier was, as he writes in the book, “an act of dispossession and a breach of international law,” – it refused to rule on the overall legality of the fence – it did order the state to reroute the fence so as to reduce the area expropriated from the Palestinian village by half. Combined with other similar cases pursued by Sfard and other lawyers, the High Court reduced the total amount of West Bank land taken from Palestinians for the barrier by a similar proportion.</p> \n<p>Sfard quickly recognized the double-edged nature of such victories. Yes, the damage wrought by the fence on individual Palestinian communities was lessened, but it came at the expense of the court giving its legal imprimatur to the barrier as a whole. And because he and his barrister colleagues were participating in the process, by necessity on Israeli terms – even though they resisted the temptation to propose alternate, less-invasive routes for fence segments they were challenging – he says he often found himself wondering whether he had become an involuntary collaborator in the creation of the barrier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I remember taking friends from abroad to see the separation fence,” he says in an interview with Haaretz. “We drove along the route, and I found myself saying, ‘I’m one of the architects of this fence.’ I explained that it had become a joint venture. Not from the beginning. But like with many other struggles, the system, whether it be the government or the army or whatever authority is involved, digests the human rights actor and makes him part of the process.”</p> \n<p>Hence the soul-searching on the highway to Tel Aviv and the decision to examine the questions being raised by way of a book.</p> \n<p>With the help of a grant from George Soros’ Open Society Foundation, Sfard took a two-year leave of absence from his small Tel Aviv law office (he returned a half-dozen times during that period to appear in court in pending cases) and moved with his family to New York. Over this period, he wrote the book in Hebrew (Keter-Modan is scheduled to publish it this spring) and then worked with the translator, Maya Johnston, and the editor, Riva Hocherman, on the English edition, which was published last week.</p> \n<p>Sfard, 46, grew up in Jerusalem and attended law school at the Hebrew University there. His parents were Polish dissidents who emigrated from that country to Israel in the late 1960s, after his father was released from a short prison term for his activism against the communist regime. Sfard was raised in the Ma’alot Dafna neighborhood, in a household filled with constant banter about politics and culture. His maternal grandfather was the late Polish-born sociologist Zygmunt Bauman.</p> \n<p>Despite the unqualified Ashkenazi credentials, Sfard says that the family traces its origins back to the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. He believes, however, that the family name comes not from the Hebrew name for Spain, Sfarad, but rather is a kabbalistic anagram of the word pardes (orchard).</p> \n<p>Sfard did his regular military service as a medic, but in 1998, he refused to do reserve duty in occupied Hebron in the West Bank and found himself sentenced to three weeks in an army prison.</p> \n<p>He had been active in political affairs at least as early as high school, but decided to study law after concluding that one couldn’t be a politician and remain honest, as he told Aviva Lori in this paper in 2005. An opportunity to do a legal internship with human rights-law giant Avigdor Feldman presented itself in 1999, he jumped at it. The internship turned into a regular job and Sfard continuing working with Feldman until he left to open his own practice in 2004.</p> \n<p>It is at his office in south Tel Aviv that I met him a few days before his departure for a two-week book tour in the United States. The office is bright and airy, but a decrepit elevator carried me up four flights from a grungy entrance where one might expect to find a used syringe or two – if the space was lit. The location reflects Sfard’s decision to forgo a lucrative career representing corporate clients: As he writes in the book, paraphrasing Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, “some are guilty of the occupation, but all are responsible for it and responsibility creates a moral duty that is incumbent on members of the collective and the primary moral duty is to fight to end the injustice.”</p> \n<p>Sfard’s life seems to be organized around this belief, but he is far from self-righteous or preachy. He has a good sense of humor and a self-awareness that allows him to come off as neither full of himself nor falsely modest.</p> \n<p>Sfard is married to Nirith Ben-Horin, a former fashion designer who today is a social worker assisting children and families at risk. They have two sons, aged 12 and 6.</p> \n<p>You have written that you are certain the occupation will come to an end some day. Can you imagine a point in the future when you can no longer say that? When you have to acknowledge that the battle is lost?</p> \n<p>“The short answer is no. The long answer is, absolutely no.</p> \n<p>“Look, people mistake my insistence that there is a reasonable path for change with optimism. But optimism is a belief, and this is not a matter of belief. It’s a matter of analyzing reality, politics and so on. In the near future, I don’t think things will change. But my understanding of history, of politics, of how people behave, is that regimes that are fundamentally subjugating people, stripping them of rights, especially groups of people, are regimes that by definition are not sustainable. And a regime of this kind has to keep on nurturing and investing in the domination practices in order to keep things from exploding.”</p> \n<p>Sfard says this conviction is one of the things that separates him from “some of my colleagues on the Israeli far-radical left: I think that Israeli society still has the genuine liberal pluralist values that it is based on. Which are under attack. We have this blessed history, where this country was established by mixing values – contradictory values – but some of them were genuinely this. And this makes the instability even worse.</p> \n<p>“One of the metaphors I use is of a split personality. From the days that the Zionist movement was created, it included contradictory values. And there’s some kind of a status quo that was reached between those competing values throughout the years. During the last decade, this status quo was shattered. But what we’re witnessing is not a new status quo; what we’re witnessing is a fierce battle.</p> \n<p>“Is there a risk that we will lose the war? Of course there is a risk. But there is no point where I, as part of this society, will say: I give up. Where I say, okay, I am willing to live in a society that doesn’t even aspire to be a democracy, where’s there’s no freedom of expression, where there are no basic rights and it’s based on fascist and racist ideology. No, I will always keep on fighting – as long as I’m allowed to, as long as I’m able to.</p> \n<p>How do you define your identity, Zionist, Jewish, religious? And when you imagine your boys reaching draft age, do you still make a distinction between service in the army in general and service in the territories?</p> \n<p>“It’s getting harder and harder to make that distinction. And I feel that I would not like my kids to go the army, in the current state of affairs. I would like them to contribute to Israeli society, and I think that they should, but I think that our biggest national project today is colonization and subjugation of the Palestinians, and being in the army is being part of it.</p> \n<p>“There are so many definitions to Zionism. But if Zionism is the belief or the desire that the Jewish people will have a place where they can exercise their right of self-determination as a nation, and that place is here, then I’m a Zionist. If being a Zionist means thinking that this should come at the expense of other people who live here, and they should become second-class citizens, then I’m not a Zionist.”</p> \n<p>Let’s talk about the Supreme Court. It is under fire from both politicians and the public, with the often-made claim that it’s trying to take the place of the legislature, and that it has to be reined in. How badly do you think the court is threatened today?</p> \n<p>“Probably the most successful lie or myth, in 50 years of Israeli history, is the idea of the court as leftist, as pro-Palestinian, as a human rights activist. There’s nothing further from the truth than that. If there is one predictive parameter – probably the biggest – for any of the Supreme Court’s rulings, it’s what does the security establishment think about the case at hand.</p> \n<p>“The people who are trashing the Supreme Court do not understand that to a very large degree, they owe the settlement enterprise’s existence to the Supreme Court. They owe the 50 years of occupation that is still ongoing, and its stability, to the court. Likewise, the people who trash the United Nations do not understand that we owe that institution our existence in international law as a nation, as a state.</p> \n<p>“And after having said all that, the court is in big jeopardy these days. And I think it’s not just at risk because it’s being targeted by legislators and by right-wing circles. But also because it is being changed from within. And the fact that in recent years, some cases were decided in ways that no court in the last 50 years would have ruled. For example, the kosher stamp that the court has given to the anti-boycott law. For example, the dismissal of the cases against the Nakba law and of the acceptance committees in small communities law. And even recently, the Supreme Court ruling that overturned a 40-year-old principle that you cannot allocate private Palestinian land for settlement purposes. Probably the only existing measurable restriction on land grabs was shattered in that decision. So, we have a different court today than we had 15 years ago. And that’s the biggest risk.”</p> \n<p>What do you say about the government’s plan to deport some 37,000 African asylum seekers from Israel?</p> \n<p>“I have to say that this is something I cannot understand. I can understand why leaders and people target Palestinians. I don’t accept it – I think people are brainwashed. I think that the Palestinian civilians are not our enemies. But I understand that there is a clash between us.</p> \n<p>“But the only explanation that I can find for the deportation [of the Africans] is that they have brown skin. And I’m terrified by that insight. Everything about the asylum seekers’ story and about Jewish history should lead to the conclusion that we are the first among all nations that should have embraced them, like Begin did with the Vietnamese [refugees beginning in 1977], and it would be in line with Jewish morality, lessons from Jewish history, and it would be the best thing Israel could do for public relations in the world.</p> \n<p>“They are not in conflict with us. They are not changing our society. They enrich our society. And the only explanation is that they have dark skin. Because we have dozens, thousands, of foreigners without dark skin who work here, and no one is thinking about deporting them. On the contrary, we want them, because they work in jobs that Israelis do not want to work in.</p> \n<p>“So, why [the Africans]? With the things that they went through? It makes me cringe with shame.</p> \n<p>“And so, the only explanation is that we have leaders that are unabashed to use the lowest and most horrendous tricks in the book, and that is incitement against the person who is different.</p> \n<p>We know that! This is us! We were there! We had the long nose, we had the peyot [sidelocks], we dressed differently, and that made us the monsters, the bloodsuckers, those who are chasing our women, are soiling our purity. And this is what the sons and daughters of the survivors of this are now doing, the same thing to people who came from war-torn countries.

        "text":["<p>As happens every year, a few days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day (January 27), the Diaspora Affairs Ministry releases a report on the state of anti-Semitism in the world. This is a fixed ritual.</p> \n<p>The report details the number of cases in which gravestones in some remote Jewish cemetery in Ukraine or Germany were vandalized and how many hooligans spat in the faces of Jews wearing kippot in London or Munich, as if they were a threat to Jewish existence, almost like an SS unit operating in Lithuania in 1942.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, wearing his other hat as diaspora affairs minister, presented the report, whose data&nbsp;– as Ofer Aderet&nbsp;showed in this paper&nbsp;– answer the accepted description of fake news, to say the very least.&nbsp;Worried, Bennett pointed out the rise in the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Britain – 30 percent more than last year! – and stated, based on the figures from the French police, that one out of every three hate crimes in France targeted Jews. The other two out of three of course targeted Muslims and blacks, but that is less important.</p> \n<p>&quot;Anti-Semitism is the dangerous fuel that has inflamed our enemies forever,&quot;&nbsp;said Bennett.&nbsp;&quot;We must ensure that every Jew everywhere in the world can live their lives in safety and pride. We must act in every way we can to fight modern anti-Semitism in order to guarantee the safety of the Jewish people, in Israel and in the Diaspora.&quot;</p> \n<p>Since the UN General Assembly unanimously passed Resolution 60/7 in 2005, which designates January 27 – the date the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and death camp was liberated – as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, it provides another opportunity for the chorus of hypocrites and the self-righteous in Israel, who get another day to spread their regular messages on anti-Semitism, the Holocaust and the security of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>The winter Holocaust Remembrance Day has been added to the one in the spring – Israel’s “Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day” – as an occasion to blather on and cover up the injustice Israel is carrying out here and now. Israel opens its commemoration of International Holocaust Remembrance Day 2018 with a breathtaking campaign of racist expulsion of African refugees.</p> \n<p>It would be appropriate to go back to the wording of the resolution and examine how much of the General Assembly’s decision is upheld in Israel. In its very first section, Resolution 60/7 mentions the connection between the resolution and the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “which proclaims that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, religion or other status.”</p> \n<p>Resolution 60/7 continues: “Recalling&nbsp;article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person; Recalling also&nbsp;article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 18 of the&nbsp;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which state that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p> \n<p>“Bearing in mind&nbsp;that the founding principle of the&nbsp;Charter of the United Nations, ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,’ is testimony to the indelible link between the United Nations and the unique tragedy of the Second World War.”</p> \n<p>The resolution mentions explicitly, in this context, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which was adopted in 1948 “in order to avoid repetition of genocides such as those committed by the Nazi regime.”</p> \n<p>Later, Resolution 60/7 mentions the Jewish tragedy, but here too the distance is great between the resolution and Israel’s manipulation of what it says: “Reaffirming&nbsp;that the Holocaust, which resulted in the murder of one third of the Jewish people, along with countless members of other minorities, will forever be a warning to all people of the dangers of hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice.”</p> \n<p>The resolution then calls on the UN member countries to “develop educational programs that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide; rejects&nbsp;any denial of the Holocaust as an historical event, either in full or part; condemns without reserve all manifestations of religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence against persons or communities based on ethnic origin or religious belief, wherever they occur.”</p> \n<p>Israel, which is about to send tens of thousands of African refugees on a long journey of wandering that will put their lives at risk, is the least appropriate country to speak in the name of the principles of UN General Assembly Resolution 60/7.</p> \n<p>An endless number of examples prove that the debate in Israel is based on hypocrisy, ignorance and evil, and completely contradicts the principles set down in Resolution 60/7. Remember, Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev described the Sudanese refugees as “a cancer in the body of the nation.” This is explicit incitement on an ethnic basis, the type that the UN resolution explicitly comes out against.</p> \n<p>Deputy Knesset Speaker MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) presented his phased plan, according to which the Palestinians in the occupied territories (and possibly Israeli citizens, too) would become, in the best case, subjects without rights with a status that reminds us of German Jews after the passage of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. To the extent that they do not agree to the plan, they will simply be cleansed from here. If they refuse to leave, they will be uprooted violently, which would lead to genocide.</p> \n<p>Another elected official from the ruling coalition, Likud's Miki Zohar, did not hesitate to state that the Arabs have a problem that has no solution – they are not Jews and therefore their fate in this land cannot be the same as that of the Jews. Where is Resolution 60/7 and where are Smotrich and Zohar? Prof. Zeev Sternhell wrote in this paper earlier this month that this racism is “akin to Nazism in its early stages.”&nbsp;I think it is Nazism in every way and fashion, even if comes from the school of the victims of historical Nazism.</p> \n<p>But this is not just a dialogue between minor political figures. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dehumanizes his own citizens and treats them as if they are the “huge quantities” flocking to the polls to bring down the right-wing government, he loses the right to speak in the name of Resolution 60/7. Of course, we must not forget the statements and comments of the religious leadership, which are a symbol and example for large parts of the national religious community in Israel.</p> \n<p>This community has turned the Holocaust into one of the central components of its identity, but its treatment of its lessons is the most hypocritical and disgusting. There are hundreds of examples of this, if not thousands. One is Rabbi David Batzri, who in 2006 came out against the establishment of an Arab-Jewish school, saying the “establishment of such a school is an act of impurity and contamination. It is impossible to mix the impure with the pure. They are a blight, an evil Satan, a plague. The Arabs are donkeys so the question must be asked as to why God did not create them walking on four legs? So the answer is they must build and clean.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Dov Lior, one of the most important rabbis of religious Zionism, whose racist teachings are followed by thousands, said in 2013 that he did “not know how to get rid of [the Arabs]. We believe the day is not far off when we will achieve the cleaning of our entire land from the terrorists and their supporters, and they should go to Saudi Arabia.”</p> \n<p>Books and pamphlets praising the murderers of Arabs or permitting the shedding of their blood, such as “Baruch Hagever” and “Torat Hamelech,” are legitimate literature among a number of those who wear knitted kippot. Many other Jews agree with the opinions appearing in these books, even if they have not read them or do not even know of their existence.</p> \n<p>More than anything else, the thundering silence of the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem is disappointing and embarrassing. Precisely now, in the face of the beginning of the deportation campaign for asylum seekers, the institution entrusted with preserving the lessons of the Holocaust should have come out loudly in the name of the principles of Resolution 60/7.</p> \n<p>It should stand at the head of the campaign being organized in various circles in an attempt to revoke the decree, which casts a great stain on Israel’s right to speak in the name of the victims of the terrible disaster that befell the Jewish people and the human race in general. But it seems this is not going to happen. Yad Vashem is known for its silence on moral questions, unless they touch on what happened during the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>And this is how Israel has become the Western country in which the most extreme, racist discourse is being conducted against ethnic minorities, whether they are refugees from Africa or Arabs. If a racism survey was conducted in the West, similar to the report on anti-Semitism that the local chorus of hypocrites bandies about every January 27, Israel would find itself near the top of the list.</p> \n<p>Daniel Blatman is a professor of history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>How juicy the peaches in Italy are. How translucent the water. And the light – so radiant. The trees, verdant. In Italy everything is so gorgeous that even the tourists look harmonious. They don’t walk around with fanny packs and cameras, like tourists usually do. They sit among the locals in the small caf&eacute;, chatting with them in Italian and playing cards with them, as though they’d been born here. The rest of the time, they wander half-naked between the trees, like magnificent lithe animals. No, they aren’t tourists at all, they’re a natural element of the local flora and fauna, bronzed summer people who show up every year, splashing around in the streams and squeezing fresh juice from the apricots. Among them a youth springs up, like another fruit on the peach tree, desires budding in his psyche. Completely natural desires, of course, for how could there be anything unnatural in a marvelous place like Italy?</p> \n<p>That youth, Elio, the protagonist of the film “Call Me By Your Name,” is beautiful and tanned, speaks three-four languages and composes on piano and guitar. His parents love him, nature loves him – loves him so much that it arranges for a mature man to teach him what love is. That, in general lines, is the guiding principle of “Call Me By Your Name,” the most discussed gay movie in a long time.</p> \n<p>Everything that happens in the film comes about completely naturally, or so it appears. Elio loses his virginity to a girl but discovers that he’s actually hot for Oliver, his father’s assistant for the summer, who writes articles about the German philosopher Martin Heidegger and the Greeks. He seduces him, and although Oliver makes an effort to quell the vortex of passion – he’s a good, decent guy – ultimately he gets caught up in it. They kiss in the lush meadow, and afterward make love. It’s all rapturous, truly rapturous, and Elio really is a delightful kid – intelligent but clumsy in the proper degree.</p> \n<p>At this stage in classic melodramas, a force that would sever the love of the two, or even end the life of one of them, would appear. But in the idyll of “Call Me By Your Name” there is no death and no fate. The only thing that can happen is that the vacation concludes, and Oliver has to go back home to America. In nature, too, the birds need to leave as summer fades, and migrate across the sea.</p> \n<p>Of course, a small provocation is embedded in the story. Elio is an adolescent and Oliver is a somewhat older man – he’s meant to be around 24 but looks as though he’s in his thirties. In the spirit of the present time, a type of scandal was to be expected, or at least a moral dilemma that could be discussed in some symposium on ethics. But because everyone loves Oliver and everyone loves Elio and everyone loves their love, the scandal doesn’t really happen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Scandals occur because of society’s hypocrisy, but if the society is tolerant and void of hypocrisy, scandals peter out, too. Everyone in this movie is as beautiful and sweet as an unflawed peach. The children are lovely and good, but the parents are even better. One can only imagine how cute grandpa would have been if he’d made it into the script.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A well-known allegation was traditionally made about films dealing with homosexual love: for years, when an affair between two men was depicted on the screen, one of the two had to die, as a kind of punishment for sinning against nature. “Call Me By Your Name” is a film of our time, an era in which no one is punished for his pure love. It’s truly wonderful that young LGBT people are getting uncompromising support from their parents. But there’s something discomfiting about an attempt to portray even the past in this film – in this case, the early 1980s – as though it was harmonious and free of conflicts.</p> \n<p>Because, in the end, even the best and most accommodating families, sexual initiation must include a certain element of departure from harmony. That’s true of straight kids, and certainly of gay ones. Childhood is over. Not everything can remain on the same track. If mom and dad were to organize our first lay, or at least create the perfect conditions for it to take place, there would be a smidgeon of incest in that. A case in point: Louis Malle’s 1971 film “Murmur of the Heart,” in which the teen undergoes sexual initiation, but in the end finds himself sleeping with his utterly charming mother. But “Call Me By Your Name” totally avoids even a hint of anything improper. Everything is proper, natural – too natural.</p> \n<p>Tranquility and fraternity</p> \n<p>The inter-age relationship is also accommodated thanks to the presence of the Greek heritage in the film. Elio’s father is an archaeologist, an expert on classical sculpture. Statues of the heroes and gods fall into his arms from the sea, whole and muscular. Oliver and Elio’s love seems to reflect the classical past: the older man initiating the youth as Achilles initiated Patroclus, as Alexander did with Hephaestion, Hadrian with Antinous. But Oliver, as well as Elio and his family are, in addition to everything else, Jews: they eat potato pancakes – latkes – on Hannukah (which is possibly why this film was chosen to kick off the annual Jerusalem Jewish Film Festival last December).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Jewish angle isn’t very important in the movie, but does exemplify the attempt to assimilate the conflicts into a meaningless harmony. Because historically, the “Greek love” between men and boys, and the culture that sprang up around it, was rejected by the Jews and repelled them. The Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria condemned the pagan culture of pederasty; even the circumcision procedure in its familiar form was created to prevent young Jews from taking part in the erotic culture of nude wrestling and athletics. But in “Call Me By Your Name” there is no conflict – Athens and Jerusalem exist side by side in tranquility and fraternity.</p> \n<p>“Call Me By Your Name” is a work from the “the pleasures of Provence” or “the tastes of Tuscany” genre. It simply adds a new element to the grilled fish, the wine, the zabaglione and the other culinary experiences of Mediterranean Europe: homosexual eroticism. The sexuality here is subordinate to the culinary, which is the central metaphor of our time. It’s nice and it’s ultra-aesthetic, but at moments the soul yearns: a little darkness, please. At least a smidgeon.</p>",

        "text":["<p>More than 525 years after expelling its Jews, Spain is officially recognizing Ladino as a Spanish tongue in the hope of saving the language of Spanish-Jewish exiles from extinction.</p> \n<p>At a conference last week at the Royal Spanish Academy in Madrid, officials announced the establishment of a new Ladino academy to be located in Israel. “One of its goals will be to save Ladino from fading away,” says Prof. Shmuel Rafael, director of Bar-Ilan University’s Salti Center for Ladino Studies.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Ladino, also known as Judeo-Spanish or Giudeo-Spagnola, is the language that was preserved by Spanish Jews following their expulsion from Spain in 1492. “It was the main tool for creating, disseminating and preserving the spoken and written culture of the Spanish Jews,” Rafael says.</p> \n<p>He says Spain’s decision derives from an understanding that Ladino is a Spanish language in the same way as are Portuguese, Catalan, Basque and the Spanish dialects spoken in Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, the Philippines and elsewhere. “Remember, there’s no single form of Spanish throughout the world,” Rafael says.</p> \n<p>One of the new academy’s first tasks may be to put together a historical dictionary of Ladino that collects textual sources in the language from the many places where it has thrived in different periods. Also, with Ladino becoming an official language, Spain will be able to add Ladino words and phrases to its popular online historical dictionary, for the benefit of the world’s 500 million Spanish speakers.</p> \n<p>“Ladino will join the international upsurge of the Spanish languages, and hundreds of millions of Spanish speakers all over the world will be able to learn about the culture of the Jews of Spain and what became of them,” Rafael says.</p> \n<p>Ottoman sanctuary</p> \n<p>Originally, Ladino was a force that brought together a wide variety of ethnic groups throughout the Ottoman Empire, where Jews fled from Spain. Jews spoke, wrote and composed in it in modern-day Turkey, North Africa, the Middle East and parts of Europe, especially the Balkans.</p> \n<p>“But in the Israeli melting pot and the global village, it gradually lost this importance,” Rafael says. UNESCO currently classifies it as an endangered language. The number of Ladino-speakers around the world is not known, but it is believed to be in just the thousands.</p> \n<p>Recent studies show that many people who call themselves Ladino-speakers only partly meet this definition because they do not master the language in all four areas – reading, writing, speaking and understanding. Meanwhile, their Ladino vocabulary is often limited.</p> \n<p>Referring to the ceremony at the Royal Spanish Academy, Rafael said it felt like “the generations of the Jews expelled from Spain and the cattle cars of Jews who left Salonika and the Balkan lands on their way to Auschwitz” were passing before his eyes. Salonika in Greece, also known as Thessaloniki, had a large, vibrant Jewish community before the German invasion in 1941 and the Nazis' subsequent deportation of Greece’s Jews to Auschwitz-Birkenau.</p> \n<p>“Even in those cattle cars they spoke to one another in ancient Ladino,” Rafael says. “Only the crematoriums at Birkenau finally silenced the voices of the Jews who spoke this language.”</p> \n<p>Rafael’s father Haim, who survived the Holocaust, was one of the Salonika Jews who were deported to Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>For this reason, Rafael considers the establishment of the Ladino academy not just Spain’s debt to the descendants of the people expelled from Spain, but also the debt of the German people, “which smothered this culture in Poland. Therefore,” he says, “the academy won’t just have a linguistic mission, it will also have a crucial cultural and diplomatic mission.”</p> \n<p>Israeli efforts</p> \n<p>In Israel, Ladino is studied and taught at Bar-Ilan University, Ben-Gurion University and Hebrew University. The new academy will aim to act as “a crossroads for a vast amount of scholarship,” Rafael says – scholarship that will spread well beyond the institution. The academy will operate in Israel as an arm of the Israel National Authority for Ladino and its Culture, which was established in 1996.</p> \n<p>“This is a very important moment, a historic moment,” Prof. Tamar Alexander, chairwoman of the Ladino authority and a scholar of Spanish-Jewish culture, told the Madrid conference. The new academy might operate out of the Yitzhak Navon heritage center to be built at Neot Kedumim near Modi’in, named for Israel’s fifth president who did much to champion Ladino culture.</p> \n<p>But despite all the academic research, scholars are divided on the chances of reviving Ladino as a spoken language. Prof. Jacobo Sefami, an expert on Latin American literature whose Spanish family emigrated to Mexico from Turkey and Syria, isn’t optimistic.</p> \n<p>“I’m an enthusiastic supporter of the establishment of the Ladino academy, but to be honest, I don’t know a single young person today who speaks Ladino,” he says. “On my last visit to Turkey, the only people I met who still spoke the language were at least 80. Despite all the efforts, I don’t think we’ll see the kind of success that happened with the revival of the Hebrew language.”</p> \n<p>Sefami says the Ladino academy will offer a framework for study and research, but here too he has reservations.</p> \n<p>“Creating a comprehensive dictionary of the language is necessary, but I also like its rebellious nature where you have people writing it the way they want without a higher authority setting its linguistic rules,” he says.</p> \n<p>After all, Sefami notes, “How can you control a language spoken by exiles who are scattered all over the world?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Believe it or not, campaign season is well underway again in the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump published his budget for 2019 this week wrapped in the political language that helped him win the presidency: attacking U.S. foreign policy and spending in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Trump began the rollout Monday, tweeting, “After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country!”</p> \n<p>However, once Trump’s $4 trillion-plus budget, that projects a $1 trillion or so federal deficit, was released it became abundantly clear that the president had only been playing politics. His budget proposes $686 billion in defense spending, the largest amount since 2011. And while much of the budget is dedicated to blunting Russia and North Korea (an additional $30 billion will go to the nuclear arsenal), the majority of it is devoted to Afghanistan and the Middle East.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The day of Trump’s budget announcement, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was in Cairo pledging support for Egypt, even though Trump had threatened to cut U.S. foreign aid to the country after it introduced a resolution at the UN condemning Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.</p> \n<p>The next day Tillerson was in Kuwait, pledging $200 million more to the coalition fighting ISIS in Syria. Wednesday, now in Jordan, Tillerson announced a boost to its foreign aid too, also despite the country’s vote on Jerusalem at the UN.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump did indeed slash funding&nbsp;– to the U.S. State Department and to USAID, by 26 percent, the largest department cut in the budget.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan took notice of Trump’s budget,&nbsp;&nbsp;specifically taking issue with the Pentagon requesting $300 million for &quot;train and equip activities&quot; in Syria, which Erdogan interpreted as funding for the Kurdish YPG (“People’s Protection Units”), plus $250 million for Syrian “border security requirements.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Our ally's decision to give financial support to the YPG (Kurdish militia)... will surely affect the decisions we will take,&quot; Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party in a speech in parliament on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Reuters reported that Turkish media agreed with Erdogan, also interpreting Trump’s budget to mean that the Pentagon had allocated $550 million to the YPG&nbsp;– the Kurdish militia Turkey is itself fighting in Syria, at great cost.</p> \n<p>A different kind of Republican</p> \n<p>Trump has long distanced himself from traditional Republican rhetoric on the Middle East. When he called George W. Bush’s Iraq war policy “stupid” and sparred with Jeb Bush during the 2016 Republican presidential primary. His accusation that $7 trillion had been “stupidly spent” on the Middle East continues this line: Trump is accusing his predecessors of using that money in the Middle East rather than in America. That attack is very popular with voters across the political spectrum in the U.S.</p> \n<p>By the way, $7 trillion seems to be an erroneous figure. According to the AP, the Pentagon estimates that “wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria have directly cost U.S. taxpayers more than $1.5 trillion.” During the 2016 election Trump claimed the U.S. had wasted $6 trillion in the Middle East – a claim Politifact dubbed as half-true. “Trump confused what’s been spent, and what is projected to be spent,” Politifact reported. That said, he’s right to note the large cost of U.S. intervention in the Middle East.”</p> \n<p>Trump seems to have taken the figure from a Boston University study which claimed a cost of “the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria at about $3.6 trillion from 2001 to 2016, using the $1.6 trillion operations costs as a baseline but also accounting for counterterrorism costs.”</p> \n<p>The president repeated the claim Monday at a White House meeting with officials and lawmakers on infrastructure: “As of a couple of months ago, we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. Seven trillion dollars. What a mistake. But it is what is. We’re trying to build roads and bridges and fix bridges that are falling down, and we have a hard time getting the money. It’s crazy.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He went on: “Think about it: As of a couple of months ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East, and the Middle East is far worse now than it was 17 years ago when they went in and not so intelligently, I have to say, went in. I’m being nice. So, it is a very sad thing,” he added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How Trump jumped from $6 trillion to $7 trillion is anyone's guess, especially as he would only be implicating himself as having added the addition trillion dollars of spending.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2016 Trump was very successful campaigning against global trade agreements, U.S. foreign aid and U.S. military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, in much the same vein as Bernie Sanders. But now, as president, that same rhetoric will be less convincing: it is his own budget putting billions more of American taxpayer money into the Middle East.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Over 40 percent of the graves in West Bank settlements have been dug on privately owned Palestinian land, according to new research by a left-wing Israeli NGO.</p> \n<p>The comprehensive study claims that some 600 graves, situated in or near 10 settlements, are built on Palestinian land, including land that has been expropriated for public use or taken by Israel for what it describes as security needs.</p> \n<p>The research was undertaken by Dror Etkes from Kerem Navot, a nongovernmental organization concerned with Israeli settlement and the state’s land policies beyond the Green Line (Israel’s pre-1967 borders).</p> \n<p>Etkes used data from the Israeli Civil Administration’s Geographical Information System, which he received following a Freedom of Information request.</p> \n<p>Until the mid-1980s, there were only two Jewish cemeteries in the West Bank – and these were both built on land purchased by Jews prior to 1948 (in Hebron and Kfar Etzion). However, Etkes says his mapping project – using aerial photography from different times, most recently June 2017 – shows that there are now 32 Jewish cemeteries containing at least two graves, scattered around the West Bank. There are also two sites featuring a single grave: one for the Jewish terrorist Baruch Goldstein in Kiryat Arba (Goldstein murdered 29 Muslim worshippers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in 1994); and a separate one in Ariel for Ron Nachman, who founded that settlement in the 1980s and was its mayor for many years.</p> \n<p>Some cemeteries are tiny, serving small communities, while others are regional cemeteries with hundreds of graves that serve several settlements (like Barkan, west of Ariel, with some 300 graves).</p> \n<p>Contested land</p> \n<p>An estimated 1,370 Jews are buried in the West Bank cemeteries, Etkes believes (some of his figures for the larger cemeteries are guesstimates, based on the aerial photography).</p> \n<p>Most of the cemeteries – 14 – are built on territory the Israel authorities have declared as state lands. Some of the biggest of these are found in Ariel and Karnei Shomron (both 100 graves), and Kedumim (50 graves). However, at least 10 cemeteries are believed to be built on private Palestinian land.</p> \n<p>Five of these (containing 78 graves, as of June 2017) are situated on what is believed to be privately owned Palestinian land in or near these settlements: Kochav Hashahar; Psagot; Mehola; Hinanit Shaked; and Yitzhar.</p> \n<p>Three cemeteries, meanwhile, are built on land that was privately owned Palestinian land before Israel expropriated it for public usage (including by Palestinians): Ofra (40 graves); Barkan (300, as stated); and Mishor Adumim (100 graves).</p> \n<p>Two settlement cemeteries, at Beit El and Shavei Shomron, are on privately owned Palestinian land that was taken by Israel for what it termed “security needs” (70 and 10 graves, respectively).</p> \n<p>This method of land expropriation was often used for the establishment of settlements, until a Supreme Court decision on the Elon Moreh settlement in 1979 ruled that the army only had the power to take land for actual military purposes and not for settlement-building. However, the seizure of lands by the army denies their original owners the right to make use of them until such time as the “security situation” passes.</p> \n<p>The most prominent recent grave to be dug on contested land (but not included in the data cited above) is that of Rabbi Raziel Shevach, who was murdered in a terror attack last month and buried in Havat Gilad, the illegal outpost where he lived.</p> \n<p>Shevach’s grave was seemingly dug on privately owned Palestinian land, situated a few hundred meters from the outpost’s homes. However, it should be noted that Pinhas Wallerstein – the former director general of the Yesha Council (the umbrella organization of settlements in the West Bank) – told Haaretz earlier this month that the land on which Shevach was buried had previously been purchased by Moshe Zar, a prolific buyer of Palestinian land in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Long-term investment</p> \n<p>Etkes’ data show that the cemeteries are often situated hundreds of meters away from the homes of the actual settlements. For example, the Kochav Hashahar cemetery – which has about 35 graves dug on privately owned Palestinian land – lies some 470 meters (1,540 feet) from the settlement’s nearest homes. The Mehola cemetery, which has five graves, is about 300 meters from the nearest settlement homes. And Yitzhar’s eight-grave cemetery lies 650 meters away from the actual settlement homes.</p> \n<p>Etkes tells Haaretz he believes the choice of where the cemeteries are situated – particularly when they lie on private land some distance from the nearest homes – is not a coincidence.</p> \n<p>“I work on the assumption that there are always deliberate intentions afoot,” he says. The placement of a cemetery “is not chosen for no reason. It is a very long-term investment – and in Judaism, whoever buries people in a certain place does so on the understanding they will not be removed.</p> \n<p>“Obviously, there is deliberate intent lurking behind the location of these cemeteries,” Etkes continues, “and it may be assumed that whoever buries the dead on private Palestinian land knows exactly what he’s doing.”</p> \n<p>Etkes is fully aware that he’s raising an extremely sensitive subject, since Jewish custom holds that graves should not be exhumed and relocated. Since all of the West Bank settlements are on occupied territory, are the subject of international dispute and the chances of their being evacuated still exist, burial in the area is not a given.</p> \n<p>Etkes points out, for example, that “there are no cemeteries serving the ultra-Orthodox settlements in the territories – none at all.”</p> \n<p>A political act</p> \n<p>The evacuation of Jewish graves from occupied territories became a real issue in Israel in 2005, with Israel’s disengagement from the Gaza Strip. At the time, Israel’s chief rabbis determined that the 48 graves situated in the regional cemetery serving the settlements (a bloc known as Gush Katif) should be exhumed and brought back to Israel.</p> \n<p>Wallerstein, who has lived in Ofra for many years, says that in the past – but especially when the settlements were still in their infancy – settlers were concerned about being buried beyond the Green Line. They often expressed a desire to be buried within Israel proper, he notes.</p> \n<p>Both of Wallerstein’s parents are buried in Ofra, but the decision to bury them there wasn’t straightforward and was ultimately made by his mother. For his part, Wallerstein says he wants to be buried in Ofra and doesn’t want his grave moved – even if the settlement itself is eventually evacuated.</p> \n<p>In the 2007 book “Lords of the Land: The War Over Israel’s Settlements in the Occupied Territories, 1967-2007,” Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar wrote that the first intifada was the catalyst for cemetery-building in the settlements.</p> \n<p>“Death was political, and it was formulated and interpreted as a life-giving elixir,” they stated. “The grave reinforced the foundations of the home and extended the roots farther into the ground. Life is mobile and can exist in many places. The finality of the grave, its being the terminal site, endows it with a numinous dimension that says ‘Touch me not.’”</p> \n<p>Wallerstein concedes there’s some truth to the notion that burial in a particular place is “an additional seal on the certainty that we will not be leaving here.”</p> \n<p>When asked if it isn’t somewhat cynical to dig graves on privately owned Palestinian lands, given that the evacuation of graves is such a sensitive matter and it’s clear it will be more difficult to evacuate them than buildings, Wallerstein demurs. “I don’t think too many people have invested much thought in this – after all, people are afraid of death,” he says, adding, “I don’t think the motivation is that you can evacuate [the settlements] or you can’t evacuate.”</p> \n<p>Fellow Ofra resident (and Haaretz columnist) Israel Harel says very few of his friends decided not to bury their dead in the settlement over concerns about what the future may bring. Most of them, he notes, didn’t hesitate when it came to being buried in Ofra.</p> \n<p>Haaretz asked the Civil Administration a series of questions related to this article: Whether it had issued permits to build cemeteries on private land; how the Civil Administration has acted in the matter; and the status of the specific land upon which Rabbi Shevach is buried in Havat Gilad. At the Civil Administration’s behest, Haaretz even provided the exact coordinates of all of the cemeteries built on private land.</p> \n<p>However, the Civil Administration did not respond to any of the specific questions. Instead it stated: “The Civil Administration acts to carry out enforcement in Area C, in accordance with the authorities and regulations, subject to operational considerations.”</p> \n<p>Yesha Council Deputy Director Yigal Dilmoni called the data “inaccurate and biased. In any case, we invite Kerem Navot to come over and move the graves to the places it chooses. It’s time for these left-wing organizations to stop hounding the residents of Judea and Samaria even after their death.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The two confidants of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the telecommunication corruption investigation are Nir Hefetz, Netanyahu’s former spokesman, and Shlomo Filber, director general of the Communications Ministry. Netanyahu held the communications portfolio for two years, from 2015 to 2017.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;All the scandals involving Netanyahu, and where they stand&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Hefetz and Filber are suspected of accepting bribes and obstruction of justice as part of what is known as Case 4000. Bezeq’s controlling shareholder, Shaul Elovitch, a friend of Netanyahu’s, has been arrested on suspicion of giving bribes. Police investigators showed him evidence that he had skewed coverage on the Walla news website he owns to favor Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, including text messages that Netanyahu associates sent to Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua, in which the senders asked to alter or delete items posted on the site about the prime minister or members of his family.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Millions of dollars, favorable coverage: What we can tell you about the new Netanyahu graft case roiling Israel &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>Hefetz, Filber and Elovitch will all remain in detention until Thursday. Filber is also suspected of aggravated fraud, breach of trust and securities offenses. Elovitch is suspected of aggravated fraud, breach of trust in a corporation, securities offenses and money laundering. Others who have been arrested on suspicion of giving bribes are Bezeq CEO Stella Handler, who allegedly intervened in what went on at Walla; Elovitch’s wife, Iris, who is also suspected of intervening in Walla’s coverage and Elovitch’s son, Or, CEO of Eurocom, through which his father holds his Bezeq stake. Also arrested was Amikam Shorer, a vice president at Eurocom who is considered Elovitch’s right-hand man.</p> \n<p>A former media adviser about Elovitch was arrested Tuesday and questioned by the police. The adviser has already been questioned in the past and according to suspicions he put Bezeq officials in touch with the Communications Ministry. Meanwhile, Boaz Stambler, another former spokesman for Netanyahu who now serves as head of Israel's Government Press Office, also gave testimony to the police.</p> \n<p>On Monday the former director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, Harel Locker, gave evidence to police, as did David Sharan, the former head of Netanyahu’s bureau, who is suspected of accepting bribes in the submarine affair (Case 3000). Numerous others have also been summoned by police, among them journalists and Netanyahu associates.</p> \n<p>Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court Judge Ronit Poznanski-Katz, who extended the detention of the three main suspects Sunday, said the suspicions looked reasonable and well-grounded. She said the suspicions being examined now are a step above the previous stage of the Bezeq investigation.</p> \n<p>Hefetz, who in recent years has been a personal spokesman for Netanyahu and his wife, is considered one of the couple’s closest confidants. During Netanyahu’s second term as prime minister, he headed the Prime Minister’s Office’s public diplomacy department, and in the last election he was the lead strategic adviser to the Likud campaign. In the past he had held a number of jobs at Yedioth Ahronoth and was editor-in-chief of Maariv when it was owned by Nochi Dankner, and later served as a personal consultant.</p> \n<p>Hefetz’s name has also been linked to the Yedioth quid-pro-quo affair, also known as Case 2000, because Netanyahu suggested to Mozes to use Hefetz as the point man between himself and Yedioth. Hefetz also gave evidence in the telecom case to the Securities Authority two months ago, when he was asked about his relationship with Filber.</p> \n<p>In November the Securities Authority completed its own investigation into the telecom case, which focused on the merger of Bezeq and Yes and the suspicion that Filber had passed classified inside information from the Communications Ministry to Bezeq. Authority investigators recommended charging Filber after they found documents relating to Bezeq that he’d given to Handler with his comments added.</p> \n<p>Recently there was evidence uncovered about an improper give-and-take relationship between Netanyahu and Elovitch, which is what led to the wave of arrests Sunday. During the court hearing Sunday, the Securities Authority attorney, Eran Shacham-Shavit, said, “Since the last investigation there have been significant developments that raise suspicions of a series of violations.” Now the authority is working with the police’s economic crimes unit, accompanied by the head of the state prosecution’s taxes and economics department, attorney Liat Ben Ari, who last week received the police recommendations in Case 1000 — in which Netanyahu is suspected of taking lavish gifts in return for favors — and Case 2000.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has denied acting on Bezeq’s behalf for unacceptable reasons. “The prime minister did not act to benefit Elovitch and Bezeq, not in exchange for favorable coverage or for anything else,” he said this week. “This is another futile investigation under media pressure, after the air was released from [Cases] 1000 and 2000 and it turned out that there was no air in 3000, the media created tremendous pressure to produce a new balloon, 4000. All the air will come out of this one, too. All the decisions made about Bezeq were in accordance with recommendations by professional committees and professional officials.”</p> \n<p>A statement released on Elovitch’s behalf said, “Shaul Elovitch categorically denies the allegations against him. We suggest being patient and not hastening to draw conclusions. We are confident that when things are clarified, it can be proven that he did no wrong.”</p> \n<p>Hefetz’s lawyer, Yaron Kostelitz, said, “I am convinced that at the end of the investigation it will emerge that Mr. Hefetz is not a suspect and he will return to his affairs.”</p> \n<p>Attorney Nati Simhoni, who is representing Handler, said, “Handler is cooperating fully with her questioning and completely denies the allegations against her. We believe it was possible to avoid arresting her and we hope her freedom will not be denied beyond this. Handler is confident in her innocence and that in time her case will be closed.”</p>",

Tell your friends to sign up for the Daily Kickoff here!</p> \n<p>PODCAST PLAYBACK --&nbsp;CNN host Jake Tapper joined The Axe Files with David Axelrod where he recalled his Jewish upbringing: “My mom converted to Judaism and my dad was raised conservative-Jewish, but probably not really all that observant. They divorced when I was about 7 or 8&nbsp;and around that time my dad started getting more in touch with his Jewish roots, and so I started going to Jewish camps and then I ended up in Jewish school from 6 through 12. There was some sort of awakening that my dad went through, maybe right before or during the divorce, and so I learned a lot about Judaism and I spoke semi-fluent Hebrew for a while when I was in college. Not really anymore”  Axelrod:&nbsp;And was there a spiritual component to it? I mean, I was Bar Mitzvah’ed and all of that, and I feel culturally akin, but it was kind of a compulsory thing, and being compulsory I was resistant to it.  Tapper:&nbsp;“That's probably what my kids are going through right now. For me it was different because I guess like any other spiritual journey, I went through periods where I was very into it. When you go to Jewish camps - and when I say Jewish camps I don't just mean like everybody there was Jewish. I mean, we'd get up and we would pray every day, every day of the week. Then on the Sabbath it was a very intense situation where you couldn't use electronics and all that. There would be a lot of praying. There were times in my life that I was really into it and other times that I'm not.”  Tapper on practicing Judaism today:&nbsp;“I would say right now it's important to me, but I'm also at the phase of my life, and maybe this is a silly phase, where I don't really think God cares too much about what I eat and put in my body. I think that God probably, if there is any sort of sense of justice in this universe, would prefer that I spend more time devoted to doing good deeds, which is part of Judaism, than praying”  Axelrod (joking): Do you have proof of this? Do you have two sources on this?  Tapper: “I have no sources on this. I have not reported this (laughter). I think a lot of the lessons of Judaism have stayed with me in terms of trying to be a good person and trying to give people the benefit of the doubt in terms of charity, and that part of Judaism and the intellectual debate - that's part of Judaism as well - that has stayed with me much more than the religious part of it, just in terms of observance. So we go to synagogue. My kids go to Hebrew school and all that but”  Axelrod: Yeah, you're reaching for the deeper -- You're reaching for the sort of more spiritual elements, the ethical constructs and so on.  Tapper:&nbsp;“Yeah. Sometimes I'll see -- I see some very unethical behavior by people who think that they are very observant. Not just Jews but all sorts of religions. I was just thinking it today, somebody who looks as though he is an Orthodox Jew on Twitter was attacking me”  Axelrod:&nbsp;How does one look like an Orthodox Jew on Twitter?  Tapper:&nbsp;“Well, his avatar was a guy with the hat and the payos and all of that. All I could think of was this is not what I learned is being Jewish I've seen a lot of that behavior. Again, not just Jews. Christians, Muslims, certainly Muslims, and a lot of people who consider themselves to be very pious doing some pretty horrific things.” Listen to the episode [JewishInsider]  MUNICH RECAP:&nbsp;“Witnessing the Collapse of the Global Elite” by Eliot Cohen:&nbsp;“At events like the Munich Conference, it is no coincidence that the word “networking” has largely replaced the word “debate” among global elites.

When the Polish prime minister declared that Jews were also perpetrators of the Holocaust, there were mere tut-tuts in response. It is a far cry from the Wehrkunde founded by Kleist.

More from Friedman's remarks: The claim that a peace deal is needed to keep Israel as a Jewish and democratic state is a platitude because for 25 years people have been saying that and Israel has only thrived and prospered.” [Axios; Nana10]&nbsp;  DAMAGE CONTROL -- “A U.S. Embassy spokesperson pointed out&nbsp;that Channel 10 based their report &quot;upon three attendees at the conference who failed to provide much of the context behind Ambassador Friedman’s comments” The spokesperson added that &quot;the Ambassador believes that unrestrained settlement growth is not helpful for peace.&quot; Stephen M. Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein... refuted the report and said that &quot;the words attributed to him [Friedman] were taken out of context, are incomplete, and are therefore a distortion of the ambassador’s remarks.”&nbsp;[Haaretz]&nbsp;  Former U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk emails... “It depends what Friedman means by ‘significant evacuation.’ Since the vast majority of settlers live in the large settlement blocs, it would be possible to create a Palestinian state on some 94% of the West Bank and only some 20% of settlers would have to be evacuated. The argument about the threat of continued occupation to Israel’s Jewish and democratic nature refers to the next 25 years, not the last 25 years. That’s when the failure to resolve the Palestinian problem will present a profound threat.”  THE DAILY KUSHNER -- “Mueller's interest in Kushner grows to include foreign financing efforts” by Shimon Prokupecz, Kara Scannell and Gloria Borger:&nbsp;“Special counsel Robert Mueller's interest in Jared Kushner has expanded beyond his contacts with Russia and now includes his efforts to secure financing for his company from foreign investors during the presidential transition It's not clear what's behind Mueller's specific interest in the financing discussions. Mueller's team has not contacted Kushner Companies for information or requested interviews with its executives.” [CNN]&nbsp;  “New White House security clearance policy could put ‘bull’s eye’ on Kushner” by Shane Harris, Josh Dawsey, Carol D. Leonnig and Robert Costa:&nbsp;”White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly announced Friday that beginning next week, the White House will no longer allow some employees with interim security clearances access to top-secret information — a move that could threaten the standing of Jared Kushner A senior administration official said that the chief of staff has been frustrated with Kushner’s high level of access without a final clearance and that he was aware the new policies announced Friday could jeopardize Kushner’s ability to carry out his duties in the West Wing. The move puts a “bull’s eye” on Kushner.” [WashPost]&nbsp;  “Reed Cordish to leave White House post” by John Fritze:&nbsp;“Cordish, 43, said in an interview that he never intended to stay in the job for more than a year. He said that the time was right to move on partly because the White House recently sent its framework for overhauling infrastructure to Congress Cordish, whose last day will be later this month, will be replaced by Brooke L.

Cordish said he would return to the private sector, but would not say whether that meant returning to the Cordish Companies.” [BaltimoreSun]&nbsp;  &quot;Trump’s rebuke of McMaster was months in the making&quot; by Eliana Johnson:&nbsp;&quot;Back in November, Trump and a small circle of senior aides involved in the conversation about McMaster's fate, including Kelly, ultimately decided to keep McMaster in place. Among their reasons for doing so: Removing him would have launched them on a search for the president’s third national security adviser in a year, and Trump and Kelly could not agree on a replacement... Trump, according to two administration officials, was looking to tap former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, whose frequent Oval Office visits ended when Kelly became chief of staff last summer. Kelly opposed his appointment.&quot; [Politico]&nbsp;  Tom Friedman writes... &quot;Whatever Trump Is Hiding Is Hurting All of Us Now:&nbsp;Trump is either hiding something so threatening to himself, or he’s criminally incompetent to be commander in chief. It is impossible yet to say which explanation for his behavior is true, but it seems highly likely that one of these scenarios explains Trump’s refusal to respond to Russia’s direct attack on our system — a quiescence that is simply unprecedented for any U.S. president in history...&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  INSIDE THE ADMIN -- “Under fire for travel expenses, Pruitt cancels trip to Israel” by Juliet Eilperin and Ruth Eglash:&nbsp;“Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has canceled a nearly week-long trip to Israel Pruitt was to arrive in Israel on Sunday and would have stayed at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem from the time of his arrival until Thursday...

        "text":["<p>In the beginning another Jewish family arrives with a herd and a mobile home and a water tank that settles down between the hill and the valley. It’s too beautiful for words. Fellow Jews from the area come to help and the cows or sheep go out to graze. We’re righteous and up to date, and go for free-range milk and meat.</p> \n<p>Or, in journalistic jargon, last Wednesday unknown people set up another unauthorized outpost in the northern Jordan Valley, at the site of an army camp that was abandoned four years ago. It joins five other outposts in the area that the Civil Administration supposedly has not approved. One of them, Givat Sal’it, is in an accelerated process of being laundered. Two have been set up in the past 18 months. The Civil Administration has issued stop-work orders against them but isn’t hurrying to implement them, so meanwhile they are flourishing; they’re getting water, planting and paving an access road.</p> \n<p>The six outposts stand in the midst of land belonging to the Palestinian communities of Al Aqabah, Hamam al-Malih, Umm Jamal, Ein al Hilweh, Tel Al-Hema, Khirbet Samara and Al Farisyeh. All these communities, like their sister communities throughout the Jordan Valley, have for 50 years been subject to a strict military regime that forbids them to build, graze, travel or connect to the water or electricity grids. And when this isn’t enough, there are evacuation orders signed by a major-general and demolition orders.</p> \n<p>That’s the normalcy that has been and that will remain, Raviv Drucker, even if and when Benjamin Netanyahu retires or is forced out of office (&quot;The morning after Netanyahu,&quot; Monday). It will remain even if Naftali Bennett and Bezalel Smotrich don’t grab the leadership, but some miracle happens and the political descendents of Golda Meir, Israel Galili and Yigal Allon come to power.</p> \n<p>The outposts in the northern Jordan Valley, like those between the villages of Turmus Aya and Jalud (“The Shiloh Valley”), Omer Ranch north of Jericho and those controlling the heart of ancient Hebron, add another important element – private, very focused and efficient violence. The legal system will sometimes deal, albeit sheepishly, with the bureaucratic, thieving violence of the army and the Civil Administration. It is this fissure that Ayelet Shaked and her jurist advisers are apparently trying to seal forever. Bureaucratic cumbersomeness can also slow down the official violence. But the outposts are the neoliberalism of settlement activity. They are unbridled and unrestrained and drive the process forward.</p> \n<p>In the pasture where our kosher cows are taken to graze, there are flocks of foreign sheep herded by Ishmaelite shepherds. They are a hazard that must be removed, our rabbis tell us. If at first we don’t succeed, we’ll succeed on the seventh try. Our strength is in our dogs that bare their teeth or in our charging into the foreign, terrified herd; how handsome and erect the Jew is on his noble horse or all-terrain vehicle. You can also kick and smack. Revenge for the years in which the gentiles, may their names be erased, smote our ancestors in exile.</p> \n<p>But here the private business ends, because the role of the Israel Defense Forces is to protect every Jew wherever he may be settled in Judea and Samaria. And violence by Jews is liable, as we know, to create friction in which Jews could be hurt. That’s why the solution is to remove the Indians.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, for example, Palestinians from the area demonstrated against the new outpost. The army dispersed them with tear gas. And that’s just the beginning. In other places the procedure is already complete: The army declares the area a closed military zone so Palestinian shepherds will not be able to plant or graze their flocks there. That’s what’s happened to Auja and the neighboring Bedouin encampments where the Omer Ranch poked a wedge between them. The area is open and safe for the Jews of the outposts, so that they can now build rows of villas and declare another settlement bloc that the consensus will forbid dismantling.</p> \n<p>Jewish colonialism is racing forward, self-confident, full of tools and tricks. Its ability to repress and dispossess others knows no limits. And there is no responsible adult to say, “Enough. No more.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In July 2007, when the security cabinet was immersed in marathon&nbsp;discussions, sometimes twice a week, about the nuclear reactor at Deir el-Zour in Syria, Finance Minister Roni Bar-On noticed changes in the tone and approach in Ehud Barak, the defense minister. The sense of urgency that had prevailed at meetings ahead of the date at which it was estimated the reactor would enter operation and become “hot,” gave way to arguments in favor of delay, to second thoughts, to grousing.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; No longer a secret: How Israel destroyed Syria's nuclear reactor</p> \n<p>Bar-On, a senior figure in Kadima, then the ruling party, under the leadership of Ehud Olmert, invited himself to a meeting with the prime minister. “Ehud, do you understand what’s going on here?” he asked.</p> \n<p>What are you talking about, Olmert replied.</p> \n<p>“Are they getting cold feet?” Bar-On asked about the defense establishment and the person heading it.</p> \n<p>Why do you ask, wondered Olmert aloud. Bar-On wasn’t sure whether his friend was putting on an act and only wanted to hear his opinion, or whether he really was blind to developments.</p> \n<p>“Well, I am your doomsayer,” Bar-On said jokingly, “so in that capacity I’m telling you that Barak is out to get the operation postponed.” What’s his interest, Olmert pressed him.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Ten years of silence on Syria strike. Why now?&nbsp;■&nbsp;The real fallout from the strike&nbsp;■&nbsp;The intelligence failure: It took years for Israel to discover the reactor&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israeli strike on Syrian nuclear reactor: Battle of the memoirs&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Who's hiding Israeli air force participation in major exercise with UAE and U.S.?</p> \n<p>“If I see only gray,” said Bar-On, “then he wants to distance the operation as far as possible from Amir Peretz [Barak’s predecessor as defense minister, during whose term operational plans involving hitting the reactor had begun to take shape]. But if I see black, then he wants it all to happen after you [are out of office].”</p> \n<p>About two months before that conversation, Judge Eliahu Winograd had released the interim report of the committee he headed, which was investigating the events of the Second Lebanon War the previous year. The withering documented depicted the prime minister, the chief of staff and the defense minister as a group of charlatans, rash and superficial. A group that was not fit to navigate the ship of state.</p> \n<p>Olmert’s image had been severely damaged. He was more or less down to single-digit results in the polls. To call him a “lame duck” was to flatter him. The general view in the political arena was that the Winograd panel’s final report would put paid to Olmert’s political career. (In the end, the report was not submitted until late January 2008, by which time Olmert was also the focus of several corruption investigations, which led to his eventual decision to step down.)</p> \n<p>“Barak wants to delay so that after you’re thrown out he will be elected prime minister and reap exclusive glory for destroying the reactor,” Bar-On claimed. You’ve got a sharp eye, Olmert told him.</p> \n<p>In the meetings that followed, Bar-On continued to challenge the defense establishment, and especially the defense minister, to explain why the operation should be delayed. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi (this was during the period before the Harpaz affair, when he and Barak became enemies) did not take a clear position. You could take what he said either way; he wasn’t looking for trouble.</p> \n<p>This week Bar-On recalled that, “Barak offered a series of excuses that didn’t sound serious. Something about an arms ship that was supposed to arrive. A real brawl erupted. After conversations I had with ministers, and conversations that Olmert had, most members of the security cabinet understood exactly what was going on. The carcass lay reeking in the security cabinet conference room. It was an open secret.”</p> \n<p>MK Isaac Herzog, who at the time was a member of the security cabinet on behalf of the Labor Party – then led by Barak – supports Bar-On’s narrative completely.</p> \n<p>“Barak held back the operation for entire weeks, for incomprehensible reasons,” he explained this week.</p> \n<p>The tension, bad blood and suspicion that bubbled beneath the surface turned into an open, bitter rivalry between the prime minister and the defense minister. “Olmert would burst out at him with horrible shouting,” Herzog said. “He has a habit of waving his hands. Barak sat opposite him in the security cabinet meetings, and the prime minister would simply scream, at him, ‘I won’t let you! I won’t allow you!’ and wave his hands in Barak’s face.”</p> \n<p>In a series of interviews held this week, Barak rejected the allegations out of hand. His rationale sounds logical: He had taken over as defense minister in June 2007 and found a plan that had been drawn up during the tenure of his predecessor, Peretz. Now, as the person in charge, and one, moreover, who had been involved in planning and authorizing operations no less complex over decades – it was incumbent on him to investigate, press, probe and look for alternatives. Any judicious, responsible defense minister, and certainly “Mr. Defense,” would have done no less.</p> \n<p>As evidence of that, the plan that was eventually approved and executed successfully, in the early hours of September 6, 2007, did not exist as such when Barak entered the Defense Ministry. It was born thanks to his efforts.</p> \n<p>Barak recalled this week that Meir Dagan, then head of Mossad, had wanted to rush the operation. Barak thought there was time and no, he was not planning to attack a “hot” reactor. “One day Dagan came into one of the meetings and claimed that information had been leaked to another country, a friendly one. I told him that that country most likely heard about it from the Americans. And if, God forbid, the matter were to go on to become known to the Syrians, there was more of a likelihood that it would have been leaked from this room, than from the country in question.”</p> \n<p>On the eve of the operation, Olmert convened the security cabinet again. Pulling a booklet out of his briefcase, he embarked on a 40-minute speech that Herzog describes now as “amazing,” a “formative moment.” “For 40 minutes he elaborated and reasoned, raised questions and replied to them, presented the risks and explained the advantages. You could have heard a fly in the room.”</p> \n<p>The difficulties raised by Barak pushed the operation back from August. In the middle of that month, Herzog and his wife, Michal, flew to Cyprus for a weekend vacation, staying as close as possible to Israel, a 40-minute flight away. Just in case. They ran into other vacationers there, Tzipi Livni and Naftali Spitzer, her husband. She too wanted to relax close to home. Herzog and Livni, who were in on the secret, occasionally huddled together, leaving Michal and Naftali to wonder what in the world they had to mumble about, with lips barely moving.</p> \n<p>“That’s where the friendship began and the trust between us sprang up,” Herzog said this week. “That’s where Zionist Union was founded.”</p> \n<p>Great. Two positive outcomes that ensured Israel continued existence resulted from the destruction of the reactor.</p> \n<p>A hate story</p> \n<p>Three prime ministers live among us: Benjamin Netanyahu, Olmert and Barak. Utter hatred exists between them, absolute loathing, of an unbelievable intensity. The insults they’ve hurled and continue to hurl at each other symbolize the burial of mamlakhtiyut – statesmanlike behavior. (“I do not harbor any hatred in my heart,” Barak said this week, when I shared my sense with him. “I even feel empathy toward Bibi, more than his ministers do toward him.”)</p> \n<p>All three leaders have worked closely with or served under one another – or both. Barak was Netanyahu’s revered commander in the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit and defense minister in his government. Barak was also defense minister under Olmert. Netanyahu and Olmert were senior ministers in Ariel Sharon’s second government. They share hundreds of hours of joint work and jointly held deep secrets that only prime ministers know. And they share neither one iota of fraternity, a sense of shared destiny or mutual respect for the high position they each achieved.</p> \n<p>Even in the toughest times in the decades-long fraught relationships between Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres, between Peres and Yitzhak Rabin, and between Ariel Sharon and Rabin and Peres and Shamir – the dialogue did not descend to such depths. There were mockery, harsh remarks, sarcasm and sometimes cursing. But no one ever ridiculed the hair color of his rival the way Olmert did Netanyahu’s, in his TV interview with Gil Riva last week. For certain, no one ever said of his former colleague that the task of mopping the prison corridor and perhaps the inhalation of bleach fumes that entailed had totally derailed his judgment, as Barak said of Olmert in Raviv Drucker’s riveting film on Channel 10 this week. And certainly no serving prime minister tweeted and wrote toxic Facebook posts about his predecessors.</p> \n<p>(The exception this week was Tzipi Livni. She was actually only acting prime minister and almost prime minister, but she had enough style and decency in her television interviews, while assuming some credit for herself, to praise Olmert for the way he handled himself in the period leading up to the attack on the Syrian reactor. He on the other hand, hurls quite a bit of mud at her in his newly published memoir.)</p> \n<p>The three months that passed between Barak’s appointment as defense minister in the Olmert government until the attack in Syria brought to an end many years of friendship between the two. Olmert was convinced that Barak, driven by political motives, was trying to get the operation postponed until he had left office.</p> \n<p>Ahead of the attack, Olmert talked to Netanyahu, head of Likud, who as then-opposition leader was already in on the plan, about the possibility of establishing a national unity government if Syrian President Bashar Assad reacted by launching missiles at Israel, and a war resulted. Olmert first revealed these contacts in Drucker’s film. The conversations did happen and Netanyahu shared the information with only a handful of top people in Likud. The agreement woud be that four Likud ministers would be coopted into the government: Netanyahu, Gideon Sa’ar, Yuval Steinitz and Silvan Shalom.</p> \n<p>The idea of Netanyahu’s becoming defense minister was also discussed. That idea had been mooted earlier, after the Second Lebanon War, and more acutely after the war ended, when Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman joined Olmert’s wobbly coalition, leaving behind a weak, small opposition. Both Olmert and Netanyahu considered the idea favorably.</p> \n<p>This is intriguing for a few reasons: 1. Considering the known rivalry between the two men, apparently the new rivalry, with Barak, prevailed over that with Netanyahu; 2. Because of his poor showings in the polls, and with a view to the final Winograd report, Olmert was considered politically moribund. Netanyahu figured that if a war were to erupt following Israel’s heroic destruction of the reactor, Olmert would surge in popularity again, and it would be better for him to be among decision makers instead of in the opposition wilderness; 3. Netanyahu had already been in the opposition for two years after resigning from Sharon’s government in 2005 on the eve of the Gaza Strip disengagement. He hated it. He was bored and looking for action.</p> \n<p>Assad, who chose not to respond to the attack on the reactor, just as the director of Military Intelligence, Amos Yadlin, had predicted, made the emergency-government option irrelevant, thereby determining the fate of two prime ministers: the one in power and the one who succeeded him in early 2009.</p> \n<p>Bloated egos</p> \n<p>Twelve hours and 12 minutes elapsed from the moment the censorial dam burst this week, allowing the story of the attack on the Syrian reactor at Deir el-Zour to find its way to the Israeli media, until the time Netanyahu saw fit to comment on it. It’s not by chance that the country’s fastest tweeter took his time. He delighted in the mutual mudslinging that erupted between his two predecessors, Olmert and Barak, who came off like two embittered, grumpy pensioners, and the surviving former heads of the intelligence establishment.</p> \n<p>The boys slugged it out, and Bibi kept his distance. What we saw beginning at 5 A.M. Wednesday was an orgy of bloated egos, “droppings” (in the colorful term of Defense Minister Lieberman) of TMI, a carnival of self-congratulations and plenty of Israeli provincialism. The operation was a tremendous success, the planning was exemplary, and luck also favored Israel. But hey, isn’t that what these guys are there for? There, in the bureaus, the bases and the war rooms? Strange that even the pilots who’d been involved in the operation were swept up in the torrent and gushed about their experiences in the media this week.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu obviously loved the fact that for a whole day one single narrative dominated: the importance of destroying a nuclear reactor that posed a threat to Israel. Look, we dared, we attacked, we bombed, and it’s good that we did so. In his laconic, coolish response, he emphasized that “Israel’s policy was and remains consistent: to prevent our enemies from arming themselves with nuclear weapons.”</p> \n<p>The policy may be consistent, the practice is less so. Menachem Begin bombed Iraq in 1981 without bragging about it beforehand. Afterward he didn’t restrain himself. Olmert dropped 18 tons of bombs in Syria without delivering panicky speeches or sowing fear about an imminent second Holocaust. After that successful attack, he displayed truly noble responsibility when he abstained from playing politics despite his fading public opinion ratings. By contrast, the current guy has been fulminating and scaring his nation for a decade now, if not two. If he had a chance to take military action, it passed with the spirit of the time.</p> \n<p>Yet still, in the short term, at least, with the police investigations against him ongoing, the story of the reactor’s destruction plays into Netanyahu’s hands. In the collective consciousness, the feeling is gaining strength that as long as threats to Israel remain, the leader of the country must be someone with security and diplomatic experience. MK Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid) and Labor Party leader Avi Gabbay are nonentities on that playing field. Lapid was briefly a member of the security cabinet (as were hundreds of ministers and officials over time) and likes to harp on it. But he was a featherweight there. Gabbay doesn’t even have the feathers.</p> \n<p>If one of the two roosters named Ehud that have pecked away at each other this week were involved in politics today, Netanyahu would be more worried, not to say hysterical. But they are pass&eacute;, and he has concerns in other quarters.</p> \n<p>Bad timing</p> \n<p>Is Ehud Olmert mulling a political comeback? Sounds off the wall. Delusional. The man, who is now 72, was convicted, jailed, and can’t, under the law, become a publicly elected official for seven years. But some say he’s thinking about it.</p> \n<p>For example, if President Reuven Rivlin grants him a total pardon as part of the celebrations of Israel’s 70th anniversary, the opprobrium will be erased and the legal obstacle removed. The chance of that happening is lower than the likelihood that Rivlin will resign as president and run for prime minister as head of Zionist Union. (Though there’s no doubt that he’d be welcome there – they’re looking for a leader.)</p> \n<p>Olmert made a serious mistake this week. Instead of waiting and publishing his book a few days after the story broke about the bombing of the reactor, in which he’s been depicted by everyone – almost – as a responsible, courageous prime minister, he allowed excerpts from the book to be published in Yedioth Ahronoth last Friday, both in print and online.</p> \n<p>He compounded the error when he chose to grant an “interview” to a talent of his choosing from the Keshet television franchise, Gil Riva, and proceeded to deluge the kid with embarrassing lies and outlandish tales, which couldn’t stand up to a simple Google test, and collapsed minutes after being uttered.</p> \n<p>For example, that Olmert never asked his secretary, Shula Zaken, to defend him (as though we’ve forgotten the criminal-style recording in which he implores her to assume the blame for the money from Talansky). Or that he only received a few envelopes of cash, totaling a few hundred dollars (not hundreds of thousands, as the trial revealed), which only covered day-to-day expenses on his official trips abroad (as though the daily expenses incurred by a mayor or minister invited to give a talk aren’t fully covered by his sponsor, municipality or government ministry). Pathetic falsehoods and fairy tales overlain with garbage, an array of slanders and settling of accounts with the top members of the state prosecution of that time.</p> \n<p>Olmert’s bitter foe, Ehud Barak, didn’t let the opportunity go by. Even before the censors allowed the publication of the Syrian reactor story, Barak gave interviews in which he portrayed Olmert as an “inveterate liar, with bona fides from the court.” Barak’s goal was to lay the groundwork for the second act in their war over the Deir el-Zour narrative. He assumed, undoubtedly, that on this front his media situation would be less beneficial than Olmert’s. After all, the latter was the prime minister at the time and he still has quite a few admirers who can testify to the way he functioned.</p> \n<p>Barak wanted to get into a matchup with Olmert, in advance of their next clash, with a significant question mark already hanging over the latter about his credibility and his ability to tell the truth. And Olmert played into his hands. If his book had come out after the reactor festival, who would have had the patience to deal with all this garbage, with Zaken and Talansky? Who would have listened to all of that, when the person at the center of tale is perceived as an Israeli hero, of the same caliber as Menachem Begin?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Helfom was one of the first to leave the Holot detention camp in the western Negev. On Tuesday afternoon, the wardens surprised him and 30 other asylum seekers by calling them for a chat. “You are being released in a few hours,” a warden told them and issued them with a temporary residency permit.</p> \n<p>Holot camp officially shut down on March 14. It has held thousands of young asylum-seeking Eritreans and Sudanese men since it opened in 2013. Up to last week, there were still 700 prisoners there, of whom more than 100 have been freed. By next Tuesday all the inmates will be gone. However, those freed are not allowed to work or to live in most central cities. Most have no money and nowhere to go.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Helfom spent only eight months at Holot out of the year asylum seekers were required to spend there under the amendment to the “Entry into Israel Law,” commonly known as the “Infiltrators Law.”</p> \n<p>He had a hard time believing that in just a few hours he could leave the jail in the desert which was his entire world for the past few months. “I began to think how I could find work again in Tel Aviv, rent an apartment, wander around, stop counting the minutes in this place,” he said.</p> \n<p>But his happiness didn’t last long. When he read what was written on the temporary permit they had given him, he was crestfallen. “Temporary permit for a residence visit,” it stated at the top of the document from the Population, Immigration and Border Authority. “This permit is not a work permit [The holder] will not live and not work in the following cities: Tel Aviv, Eilat, Petah Tikva, Netanya, Bnei Brak, Ashdod, Jerusalem. Enforcement actions will be taken against an employer who employs the aforementioned in these cities.”</p> \n<p>He read the words again and again and became angry. “Where do they want me to go? Everyone I know lives in those cities. Who will rent me an apartment somewhere else? They know that. I will have to sleep on the street like I slept in Levinsky Park for two weeks when I first came to south Tel Aviv. Between prison and a homeless life, I don’t know which is better,” said Helfom.</p> \n<p>For years, the opponents of jailing and deporting asylum seekers have been saying the government is responsible for the difficulties of the residents of south Tel Aviv – where the greatest concentration of asylum seekers have settled, after they were brought there on buses by the government. They suggest distributing the asylum seekers more equally in various towns around the country instead of deporting them. However, without money and a checkbook, the released Holot inmates will not be able to rent an apartment in nice suburbs like Herzliya, Givatayim or Rishon Letzion.</p> \n<p>“In south Tel Aviv they are used to renting to us, I made some phone calls since I was released and no one wants to rent an apartment to a gang of asylum seekers. Israelis are not interested in us,” Helfom says.</p> \n<p>Three days after his release from Holot, no remnant of the initial joy on hearing of his release remains. The excitement was replaced by fear. For now, he is living with friends in Tel Aviv and is afraid the Immigration Authority inspectors will catch him. They were told in Holot that those who are caught in one of the banned cities will be returned to jail – this time to the Saharonim facility for an undefined period of time. “The Israel Prison Service told us that those who are caught will stay in jail. I’m scared. I’m hiding here for now and looking for an apartment, but it’s not easy. I don’t have money and I don’t have work somewhere else,” says Helfom.</p> \n<p>The Population and Immigration Authority said in response that “enforcement will be done according to the law,” and denied that everyone who is caught will be sent to Saharonim.</p> \n<p>Haaretz has learned that since January 1, when the deportation plan began, 455 Eritrean and Sudanese nationals have left Israel in the so-called “voluntary departure program.” About 12,000 men whose applications for asylum were refused are expected to be deported. Some 39,000 Eritreans and Sudanese are currently staying in Israel, about 5,000 of them children.</p> \n<p>The authorities say that at this stage no women or children will be deported. Either way, for Sudanese and Eritrean citizens released form Holot, it’s going from one prison to another. From an isolated and fenced-in facility in the desert, they are thrown into a life of fear and persecution in cities where they are forbidden to live or work, to imprisonment for an unlimited period in Saharonim or forced deportation to a third country. When these are the only scenarios that Helfom and his friends can see on their horizon, it is no wonder that they are finding it hard to preserve even a slim glimmer of hope.</p> \n<p>The detainees at Holot were obliged to remain in the compound from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. During the day they could leave the compound, but not work. Many of them don’t venture beyond the compound’s desert surroundings. Their pocket money, some 500 shekels a month, is not enough for long trips. They count the days in boredom and spend most of the day sleeping.</p> \n<p>Helfom’s situation is relatively good. He and those who submitted their asylum requests by December 31, 2017 and have not been refused, will be released from Holot. The rest will be moved to the nearby Saharonim prison. Haaretz has learned that 50 people have already been imprisoned in Saharonim.</p> \n<p>The authorities’ responsibility pertains only to closing the facility down. On the other hand, private groups are trying to help the refugees survive in the new reality. For example, Kibbutz Movement Secretary General Nir Meir and Dr. Avi Ofer sent a letter this week asking all the kibbutzim in Israel to take in asylum seekers following their release from Holot.</p> \n<p>“We call on kibbutzim to make every effort to host/take in, if only for a few months, most of the asylum seekers and provide them with housing and work as much as possible. These are people with a legal visa and are permitted to work. This is a test for all of usPlease respond generously and in keeping with our Jewish, humane and kibbutz values.”</p> \n<p>After a discussion on the matter a month ago at the request of several kibbutzim, the movement’s secretariat wrote in summary that “the Kibbutz Movement cannot stand idly by in view of the asylum seekers' expected expulsion, which is seen as opposed to Judaism, humanism and the Kibbutz Movement values.”</p> \n<p>Stop the Deportation, a movement set up by students who object to deporting the asylum seekers, is also seeking a solution. “Deporting the asylum seekers is a moral stain on Israel and we can still stop it,” says movement activist Yoav Kellerman.</p> \n<p>“Closing Holot at this time is meant to pressure the asylum seekers further. Forbidding them to live or work in central cities is intended to deteriorate them to hunger or turn them into outlaws against their will. This is on top of a series of inhumane act the state is imposing on the asylum seekers and will take their toll on Israel’s citizens as well,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Numerous initiatives are taking place to help them find employment and housing all over the country. Dozens of business owners have agreed to employ them,” he says. However, the plans are still being made and the freshly discharged refugees still have nowhere to go.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday Helfom and some 40 others were released; on Wednesday another group came out of the prison. They were smiling broadly and taking photographs with each other “to post on Facebook, to show friends,” one of them says.</p> \n<p>“I’m never coming back here,” says Halo, 27, an asylum seeker from Eritrea, before getting on the bus. “I almost went mad here. They think we’re not human beings in Israel. I’m not a murderer, or a thief, I’ve done nothing wrong. I came here to ask for asylum. My brothers were very well received in Europe. I’m a young man, and instead of letting me live they stuck me in a prison in the desert,” he says.</p> \n<p>Outside the compound a young man circles a bench over and over. “Pay no attention, poor guy, he went mad here,” a colleague of his says. “He was OK when he came here. Some people have lost their sanity in Holot.”</p> \n<p>Sigal Rozen, Public Policy Coordinator at the Hotline for Migrants Workers, who has been accompanying the Eritrean and Sudanese community from its first days in Israel, says: “It’s extremely troubling that the prison called Holot, whose declared purpose was to make the asylum seekers' lives miserable until they leave, has survived four years, during which we’ve seen the authorities try to break their spirits.”</p> \n<p>“This facility has no equal in the world and it’s sad that it took more than a billion shekels of the taxpayers’ money until they decided to close it, and forcefully deport the inmates,” says Rozen, who visited the prison regularly from the day it opened.</p> \n<p>“There are moral, just solutions that are also economically sound, the authorities know this yet choose to ignore it and continue their brutal policy of imprisonment and denying the asylum seekers a legal status in Israel,” she says.</p> \n<p>In a phone call the day after his release, Halo said he was trying to get used to Rehovot again. “They told me this is a good city. Somebody I know here got me food and a bed to sleep in at his house for the night. There are good people. I’ll find a job, I have no choice. I’m a good worker. I don’t want to risk going back to jail now,” He said. As to what he will do when he is asked to choose between Saharonim and leaving for Uganda or Rwanda, he finds it difficult to answer. “I can’t do either one. I can’t leave Israel and I can’t go back to jail. I’m praying.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>PARIS - Thousands of people marched in Paris on Wednesday in memory of Mireille Knoll, the 85-year old Jewish Holocaust survivor murdered in her Paris apartment last Friday. Attendees of the march said they were worried by the growing insecurity from the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in France.</p> \n<p>However, the silent decorum of the march to honor a woman who survived Nazi horrors only to be stabbed to death last week in an alleged anti-Semitic attack was broken with the crowds shouting &quot;Nazi! Nazi!&quot; and other insults at France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen.</p> \n<p>&quot;Nothing ever improves. We marched last year for Sarah Halimi and now another woman is killed. We're desperate,&quot; said Ilan and Aharon, who are in their twenties, refrencing another Jewish women who was killed in Paris last year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; France's Jewish Problem | Opinion ■ French Jewish student group hit with vandalism: 'Death to Israel', 'Vive la Palestine' &lt;&lt; </p> \n<p>&quot;This is the first time I see people turning out and denouncing this violence, but it seems most people protesting today are Jewish. I would have liked to see more Muslims,&quot; said 70-year-old Dona, who lives in a village in southern France.</p> \n<p>&quot;I don't personally feel threatened and I don't think France is anti-Semitic, but I feel the danger is getting closer,&quot; she said.</p> \n<p>During the march, thousands sang the Marseillaise, France's national anthem, outside Knoll's building. But not all were welcome.</p> \n<p>D&eacute;gage!</p> \n<p>The march was organized by CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish groups, to honor Knoll's memory and stand against anti-Semitism in France. The group's leader told far-right and far-left groups not to attend, sparking controversy between the political parties and the group.</p> \n<p>However, far-right politicians did attempt to take part in the march and were heckled by dozens of protesters, with National Front leader Marine Le Pen and MP Gilbert Collard being met with cries of &quot;D&eacute;gage!&quot; (&quot;Get out!&quot;).</p> \n<p>&quot;We kicked them out a first time and then they came back, so we pushed them out again&quot; said Brigitte, one of the marchers.</p> \n<p>&quot;I shouted at Le Pen. I can't stand her. Her father said the gas chambers were a 'detail' of history and she dared to come to a march in memory of Mireille Knoll, who escaped the Holocaust!&quot; said her friend Carol.</p> \n<p>&quot;I can't stand these people. We have to stop listening to people like these who try to incite hatred.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Le Pen has only come here to try and get our votes in the next election. She's trying to scare us and it inciting us against one another, but we marched together today: Jews, Muslims and Christians,&quot; said Brigitte.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>'The way things are'</p> \n<p>Gilbert Collard, the right-wing lawmaker who was thrown out of the protest, told Haaretz that he's &quot; not surprised or shocked by the way these people have treated me.</p> \n<p>&quot;That's the way things are,&quot; he said, as people hit the back of the car he was rushed to as it drove off.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Jewish umbrella group CRIF had warned that far right party wasn't welcome at the march, but Daniel Knoll, the victim's son, said all were welcome to attend as long as the did not exploit the event for political ends.</p> \n<p>Many in the crowd said that the Jewish group was right to ban the National Front from the event, but also said they disagreed with its decision to ban the far left party 'Insoumis' as well.</p> \n<p>&quot;The far right is not the same as the far left. When CRIF excludes them both it puts those parties on the same level and this legitimizes&nbsp;the far-right.&quot; said Brigitte.</p> \n<p>&quot;We always accuse the far-left of failing to denounce anti-Semitism and now CRIF tells them they're not wanted? We want them to join us!&quot; said protester Carol.</p> \n<p>But others did not want to see 'Insoumis' leader Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon at the march and he and his supporters were also booed. He was heckled and was escorted out of the march like Le Pen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;People looked at me with so much hatred. I've never seen anything like this,&quot; said his friend 74-year-old Nicole, who is Jewish. &quot;I want to fight hatred too but I think we should do this by bringing hope to French Muslim youths who believe they're discriminated against.&quot;</p> \n<p>'Natural to come'</p> \n<p>Last April, after the murder of Sarah Halimi— a 66-year-old Jewish teacher and physician whom prosecutors say was murdered by her Muslim neighbor partly in connection with her Jewish identity— few people turned out for the march in her honor and only one national newspaper covered the killing.</p> \n<p>Wednesday's protesters said Mireille Knoll has inspired more solidarity than Halimi because her killing happened at the same time as the terror attacks in Trebes.</p> \n<p>&quot;I was startled when I heard this on the radio. Where is this country heading?&quot; said Miriam, a veiled woman who came with her 12-year-old son Yassin. &quot;We came to show our solidarity - because we heard Ms. Knoll's son say everyone can come.&quot;</p> \n<p>Several people in the crowd thanked the woman, who travelled from a town north of Paris.</p> \n<p>&quot;It's natural to come. All parents should show their children we need to show empathy and be tolerant.&quot;</p> \n<p>Many in the Jewish community, though, said they are sick and tired of silent white marches. &quot;We need a red march of protest,&quot; wrote Michel Zerbib, the editor of Jewish station Radio J.</p> \n<p>French President Emmanuel Macron made a surprise appearance at Knoll's funeral on Wednesday. In a speech at the 19th century Invalides monument, Macron decried the &quot;barbaric&quot; views that fueled an Islamic extremist's supermarket hostage-taking last week as well as Knoll's killing.&nbsp;Macron said&nbsp;Knoll's attacker &quot;murdered an innocent and vulnerable woman because she was Jewish, and in doing so profaned our sacred values and our history.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Forget the U.S.-China trade war, the Italian media has spent the weekend obsessing over a different conflict: the “artichoke war.” Its interest follows a recent Haaretz report that Israel's Chief Rabbinate has banned a ready-made version of the Roman-Jewish community’s specialty dish,&nbsp;carciofi alla giud&igrave;a, from Israeli shelves.</p> \n<p>The Rabbinate considers the dish nonkosher because insects and worms might reside within the heart of the multi-leafed vegetable (not to be confused with the Jerusalem artichoke), thereby making it unacceptable under Jewish religious law.</p> \n<p>But carciofi alla giud&igrave;a (Jewish-style artichoke) is a hugely popular dish among Rome’s Jewish community, being based on a recipe dating back to the 16th century, and&nbsp;the community has no intention of conforming with the Rabbinate’s regulations. However, the Jewish community in Milan asked a local restaurant specializing in Roman-Jewish cuisine to leave the original recipe for carciofi alla giud&igrave;a off the menu, or at least change it in compliance with the Israeli guidelines.</p> \n<p>Shortly after Haaretz broke the story last Wednesday, Italian journalists headed en masse to Rome’s Jewish Ghetto area – where most of the restaurants serving carciofi alla giud&igrave;a are located – to get, well, the dish on the dish.</p> \n<p>According to leading Italian daily La Repubblica, Roman Jews defended their specialty dish by noting that artichokes in Israel and Italy are not the same.</p> \n<p>“Our artichokes are tighter and more compact than the ones in Israel, which prevents insects and worms from dwelling inside,” a source told La Repubblica, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Roman Jews know exactly which ones to choose and how to cook them for them to be legitimate,” the source added.</p> \n<p>Many other made similar claims that the Roman artichokes used for carciofi alla giud&igrave;a – such varieties as mammole, romaneschi and cimaroli – are not susceptible to bugs or worms.</p> \n<p>“I’m 80 years old and have never seen a worm in an artichoke,” cook Italia Tagliacozzo told Italy’s biggest-selling daily, Corriere della Sera, on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Although Rome’s chief rabbi, Riccardo Di Segni, preferred not to comment on the matter, some Italian news outlets pointed out that he included a recipe for the dish in a book he published in 2010. “We are the people of the artichoke, not only the people of the Holocaust,” wrote Di Segni in a passage from the book quoted by La Repubblica.</p> \n<p>Jewish cooks interviewed by the Italian press said the methods they use to clean the artichokes remove the risk of accidentally serving “nonkosher meat” in the form of bugs or worms, which is the reason Israel’s Rabbinate (and also America’s Orthodox Union) deem the dish nonkosher.</p> \n<p>“We’ve been eating this dish prepared this way for 600 years. I’m a little worried about the souls of all the people who have been eating it over the centuries – I hope nothing bad happens to them,” joked Umberto Pavoncello, manager of Nonna Betta, a kosher restaurant in the heart of Rome’s Jewish Ghetto area, speaking to French news agency AFP.</p> \n<p>In a second interview given to the Italian news agency ANSA, Pavoncello said it would be “blasphemous” to deprive the Rome community of its signature dish.</p> \n<p>Such a risk is negligible, however. The media frenzy around the “artichoke war” largely ignores a crucial passage in the initial Haaretz report, which noted that Jewish communities around the world are able to set their own kashrut policies&nbsp;– as long as products prepared under their supervision are not intended to be exported to Israel.</p> \n<p>While Roman Jews shared memes on social media showing the Jewish-style artichoke and the words “Je suis carciofo” (a play on the “Je suis Charlie” meme after the terror attack on the French satirical magazine’s offices in January 2015) and jokingly asked whether they should give up membership of the Jewish community in order to be keep eating the Jewish-style artichokes, few recognized that the Rabbinate’s authority does not extend beyond Israel’s borders.</p> \n<p>“The influence of the Rabbinate on communities around the world on the issue of [what is] kashrut is purely inspirational, and its decisions are not binding for them,” said Rabbi Shneor Revach, who runs a kashrut laboratorial consultancy and sometimes advises the Rabbinate. “The Rome community should not worry,” he concluded.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The official signal was sounded a year ago, in mid-July 2017. In an incident involving a microphone left open – it was not clear whether this was deliberate or not –&nbsp; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heard sharply assailing the European Union during a closed meeting held in Budapest with the prime ministers of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a group of countries known as the Visegrad Group, or the V-4. “The EU is the only international organization which predicates its relations with Israel – which provides it with technology – on political considerations,” said Netanyahu at the time, supposedly for the ears of these leaders only. However, his words were clearly heard over earphones handed out to journalists moments before they were cut off: “We have special relations with China and they don’t care about political issues. Modi told me he has to look after the interests of India; Russia doesn’t set political conditions and Africa doesn’t either. Only the European Union does – it’s crazy. It’s contrary to European interests.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Angela Merkel is losing to the Orban-Trump-Netanyahu camp</p> \n<p>This was the first visit to Hungary by an Israeli prime minister since relations between the two were resumed. The scene in Budapest, with Netanyahu starring as the guest of honor of a group of countries considered flag-bearers of ultra-nationalism within the EU, was a forerunner of things to come: a gradual and systematic warming of Israel’s partnership with these countries in the international arena; a move designed, among other goals, to erode the consensus among EU members regarding the Palestinian and Iranian issues. Indeed, Netanyahu asked his counterparts to help him in facing EU institutions. “I propose that you transmit a message to your counterparts in Europe,” he said. “Don’t undermine the only country in the region that looks after Europe’s interests. Stop attacking Israel. Europe undermines its own security when it undermines Israel, due to a crazy attempt to impose political conditions.” Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban intervened, saying with disdain that “the EU sets conditions for those who are already members, not just for those outside it.” Netanyahu responded sharply: “Europe needs to decide whether it wants to live and prosper, or to disappear.”</p> \n<p>Exactly a year after that meeting, Orban is planning a reciprocal festive visit to Israel. According to the Foreign Ministry, this will take place between the 18th and 20th of July. Like any other official visit at this level, it&nbsp; is expected to include a visit to Yad Vashem and the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat coordinated the details of the visit while at a meeting with his counterparts in the V-4 group. The group is considering holding its next meeting of leaders in Israel, which isn’t even a member state.</p> \n<p>In tandem with the upgrading of relations with Israel, there is growing friction between central European states and the EU. This revolves mainly around the issue of migrants. Tensions reached new heights this month over a compromise on closing the EU’s external borders and the establishment of screening centers for migrants. The measures were opposed by Germany, but strongly promoted by Hungary and Poland.</p> \n<p>These two countries, led by ultra-nationalist right-wing leaders, have been challenging the EU in recent years, using the massive wave of migration in 2015 and the rise in global terror to cast doubt on the common liberal values on which the EU was founded. Hungary, led by Orban, is the extreme symbol of the opposition. During his three terms in office Orban has led a campaign to restrict democracy in his country through a legislative assault. This included limits on civil society and on media freedom of expression, as well restrictions imposed on the courts. Part of this campaign over the last two years has included attacks against the Hungarian-born Jewish-American billionaire George Soros, who donates money to human rights groups in Hungary. Netanyahu also attacks Soros as part of his campaign against left-wing NGOs. The Hungarian government’s inflammatory campaign is perceived by many Hungarian Jews as replete with anti-Semitic elements.</p> \n<p>In Poland too there is an ultra-nationalist government, which, although it differs from Orban’s on social and economic issues, has constant tension with the EU due to the different values they espouse. In contrast to Hungary, Poland continuously tries to mitigate the frontal confrontation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the Czech Republic and Slovakia governments are led by parties considered to be centrist. However, Czech President Milos Zeman is known for his pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies. He is an avid supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, opposes migration and is known for his anti-Muslim statements. Slovakia is more marginal in the confrontation with the EU and with regards to relations with Israel. However, opposition to migration is strong there too, and this country’s foreign relations are influenced by its partners in the V-4. Austria is another country whose relations with the EU and with Israel resemble those of the V-4.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Historically, Germany has served as a bridge between east and west. However the growing feeling in Berlin is that relations with the V-4 have deteriorated significantly since the borders were opened to migrants. In a plan recently leaked to the media it was revealed that Berlin is preparing for the possibility that states in central and Eastern Europe may leave the EU and set up a European-Asian autocratic union. The growing Chinese investments in the region have fueled such speculation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel has been exploiting this internal, complex and delicate European dissent in recent years in order to change the way decisions about its policies are made in the EU. Observers in Brussels point to a chilling effect created by the alliance between Israel and the V-4 on the ability to issue joint statements in the name of all 28 EU members. “Netanyahu succeeded in using this group in order to undermine European unity,” they say. This effect is not limited to just these four countries. There are similar ties with Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Cyprus and even Greece. “When the Union wants to issue something in the name of all its members, as happens in foreign affairs, there are specific cases in which Hungary objects or demands a softening of the criticism of Israel, to the extent that other countries cannot agree, so that the declaration is void,” say these observers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of these is Martin Konecny, director of the European Middle East Project (EuMEP) which is based in Brussels. “The Visegrad countries, and in the first place Hungary, have been increasingly weakening and even blocking joint EU statements on the conflict. They are often joined by other eastern EU states such as Romania, Bulgaria or Croatia. That dynamic is not new but the bloc has become more assertive and numerous in the last 2-3 years. This has made it more difficult for the EU to speak with one clear voice on the conflict,” he says.</p> \n<p>A salient current example of this, Konecny says, is the move in which Hungary, Romania and the Czechs blocked an EU statement against the transfer of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem in May. The same states, together with Austria, took part in a reception organized by Israel’s foreign ministry on that occasion. The Czech Republic and Slovakia have in the meantime declared that they will move their cultural centers to Jerusalem, and promised to move their embassies as well in the future. Romania has also promised to do so. This is in response to heavy pressure exerted by Netanyahu on this issue over the last year. It’s likely that Orban will also offer such a promise during his visit in Israel. So far no EU state, including those in central and Eastern Europe, has violated the EU policy, which opposes the transfer of embassies before a peace agreement is reached. In addition, these countries have been making it difficult for the EU to sign direct agreements with the Palestinians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Observers in Israel said this week that Netanyahu’s haste in resolving the Polish law regarding the Holocaust was connected to his wish to bolster relations with Poland. The Prime Minister’s Office, however, denies this.</p> \n<p>Dr Nimrod Goren, the head of the think tank, Mitvim, the Israel Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, believes that fostering relations with these countries at the expense of larger liberal European countries is a mistake which harms important friendships. “Israel has traditionally preferred strengthening ties with specific countries, but in the past it recognized the importance of its ties with the EU, in terms of common interests and values. This was never politically controversial. In recent years there has been a change and the ties with the Visegrad group reflect this well. The choice of these countries attests to Israel’s moving away from the values of a liberal democracy. The Economist’s democracy index ranks all these countries lower than Israel. These should not be Israel’s allies in a continent which prides itself on democratic ideals and human rights. Germany, Britain and France are much more important for ensuring Israel’s security and for fulfilling its national interests. Choosing the V-4 distances Israel even more from the EU, which is investing a lot in contending with challenges posed by these countries. It also contradicts Israel’s efforts to fight extreme right-wing elements in other European countries, as well as Israel’s ties with Cyprus and Greece, which consider democracy a strong binding factor to Israel. Israel should diversify its foreign policy but without losing its moral compass.”</p> \n<p>Israeli sources told Haaretz in response that “V-4 states are interested in the tightening of relations with Israel for the same reasons that the rest of the countries in the world are: They correctly recognize the potential lying in the tightening of these relations for the benefit of financial-technological development and the handling of the challenges posed by terrorism, which transcends borders.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Rona Ramon, the widow of Israel’s first and only astronaut, died of pancreatic cancer Monday at age 54.</p> \n<p>Ramon’s husband, Ilan Ramon, was a crew member on America’s 2003 Columbia space shuttle mission when the spacecraft blew up, killing all on board. Rona Ramon later lost her son Asaf, an Israel Air Force fighter pilot, in a training accident.</p> \n<p>She subsequently established the Ramon Foundation to promote academic excellence and social leadership among Israel’s young people.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is &quot;deeply sorrowed&quot; by Ramon's death. &quot;Rona had heroically stood up after the passing of her husband Ilan and son Asaf, our admired pilots. She had, just as heroically, fought against cancer, which sadly overpowered her. We will always remeber her and her incredible family.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ramon was born in 1964 in the Tel Aviv suburb of Kiryat Ono. She served as a paramedic in the army and then earned a bachelor’s degree in physical education from the Wingate Institute. She later studied holistic health and worked as a holistic therapist.</p> \n<p>In 1986, she married Ilan Ramon, an air force fighter pilot who took part in the bombing of Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981. The couple had four children.</p> \n<p>She suffered the first of two major tragedies in her life when the space shuttle Columbia exploded on its return to earth, killing her husband, who had been on his maiden flight as an astronaut. “Organizational behavior, that’s what killed the Columbia’s crew,” she later told the Israeli investigative television program “Uvda.”</p> \n<p>Six years later, her eldest son, who had followed his father into the air force, was killed in a training accident when his F-16 crashed in the South Hebron Hills. He was buried alongside his father at Nahalal in Israel’s north.</p> \n<p>Ramon later said she hadn’t hesitated to let her son Asaf enter the air force, despite having lost her husband. “A boy of 18 who has dreamed of flying all his life ... I wrote him a letter telling him I give him permission to begin his life,” she said. Nevertheless, his death was “a blow below the belt, beyond doubt,” she added.</p> \n<p>In her interview with “Uvda,” she criticized the army for being inattentive to her son’s condition before the fatal flight. “We saw that he was tired,” she said. “It’s very frustrating, because they’re always talking about ‘the air force family.’ As a family, you need to see the members of your family. He was so exhausted, and he had no one to talk with. It drives me crazy.”</p> \n<p>It was after Asaf Ramon’s death that she set up her foundation. She also began giving frequent lectures about her life and spoke a great deal about coping mechanisms in life.</p> \n<p>“It’s true that the hand of fate has struck me, and how it has struck me. But I have the privilege of choosing how I get up and rise above the great crises that life had in store for me, and I decide which music I choose to hear,” she said.</p> \n<p>“The suffering was great, and dealing with it was unbearable,” she continued. “Nevertheless, I knew I had people to live for, that was clear and convincing: I would keep going for my children, at the most simple and practical level. I would function. If I managed to make lunch for everyone, if I managed to pick everyone up on time from after-school activities and sports fields and not forget anyone – because that, too, has happened – then I was okay.”</p> \n<p>On Israel’s 68th Independence Day two years ago, Rona Ramon lit a torch at the annual torch-lighting ceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>In her speech at that event, she recited the following: “I, Rona Ramon, daughter of Gila and Yisrael, who were among the first members of youth aliyah from Turkey, am lighting this torch in honor of my loved ones Ilan and Asaf, who are a candle and a beacon for the realization of my vision; in honor of the air force pilots through the generations who have defended us from above; in honor of the spacemen who breached boundaries for humanity’s sake; in honor of my children and all the young people growing up with faith in mankind, love of country and hope for peace; and in honor of the family of the bereaved, in honor of those who act despite the pain and create from amid the darkness.”</p> \n<p>Rona Ramon is survived by three children, Tal, Yiftah and Noa.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was one of the Mossad’s most daring, complex and longest-running operations. But only now, 37 years on, is the story of a Red Sea diving resort run by the agency getting its moment in the sun.</p> \n<p>“Operation Brothers,” which ran for over three years in the early 1980s, was a breathtaking mission. At its heart was the Arous Holiday Village, a small beach resort billed as the “diving and desert recreation center of Sudan.”</p> \n<p>According to a brochure distributed to European travel agencies, Arous offered a combination of desert vistas, sandy beaches and coral reefs, including real shipwrecks off the East African coast for diving enthusiasts to explore.</p> \n<p>But here’s what the brochure didn’t say: It was all a front – devised and maintained by the Israeli intelligence agency, whose operatives would visit Sudanese refugee camps with trucks, load them up with Ethiopian Jews (also known as Beta Israel), embark on treacherous journeys across Sudan back to the resort, from where the Ethiopian Jews would be shipped or flown to Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Subscribe for just $1 - your best spent 3.5 shekels ever</p> \n<p>If this sounds like the stuff of a Hollywood movie ... well, it now is. Decades after details about the story were first revealed, “Homeland” co-creator Gideon Raff has written and directed “Red Sea Diving Resort,” inspired by the real-life events between 1981 and 1985. The movie, which is set to be released later this year, was shot in South Africa and Namibia last year and stars Chris Evans, Haley Bennett and Ben Kingsley.</p> \n<p>No one has been more surprised at the renewed interest in the story than Gad Shimron, who played a key role in creating and running the Red Sea resort. Though parts of the story had trickled out in the Israeli media over the years, Shimron’s 1997 book, “Mossad Exodus; The Daring Undercover Rescue Of The Lost Jewish Tribe,” was the first to detail the events at Arous.</p> \n<p>“I’m very happy the story has been revived and brought back from the dead,” Shimron tells Haaretz, noting he’s “fairly sure” it was his book that inspired Raff to tell the story.</p> \n<p>Shimron’s book reads like a spy novel, complete with cliffhangers in which the protagonists escape thanks only to their quick wits. Shimron’s career trajectory combining stints in the Mossad and years as a journalist made him the ideal person to tell the tale – or as much of it as the Israeli military censor and Mossad would allow him to recount.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;How Netflix fell in love with the Mossad</p> \n<p>“It was the experience of a lifetime,” he reflects. “So much happened: We were shot at; I was arrested and interrogated by Sudanese security. Thank goodness nobody was killed or seriously wounded, but the operations moving the immigrants were definitely dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Very dangerous, in fact. Such as the time in March 1982 when the Israelis were fired upon by a Sudanese military unit that had followed them and their “human cargo” to the beach, believing they were smugglers. Shimron recounts that the ambush happened just as the agents were loading the last of a group of Ethiopians onto a rubber boat, sending it out to rendezvous with an Israeli naval vessel waiting in international waters.</p> \n<p>As the shots flew over their heads, one of the Israelis started screaming at the Sudanese officer in charge. “What are you doing, you fool? Are you out of your mind shooting at tourists?” Threatening to complain to the Sudanese chief of staff, whom he mentioned by name, the agent continued, “Can’t you see that we are organizing night diving here for tourists? We work for the Tourism Ministry, bringing tourists from all over the world to acquaint them with the beauty of Sudan, and all you fools can do is fire at us?!”</p> \n<p>The tactic worked and the officer stammered an apology. But the close call marked the end of the maritime rescue missions, which had taken place over the preceding six months. After that, from the summer of 1982 until the fall of 1984, small-scale airlifts took place. In all, there were 17 separate airlifts in which planes landed on a makeshift airfield in the desert and took off filled with Ethiopian Jews – all coordinated and executed by the Arous team.</p> \n<p>But it wasn’t all James Bond-esque escapades. Shimron admits that “in the long periods between the operations, we had the best time of our lives. Yes, we were living in very simple conditions, with electricity for only a few hours a day. But we lived in a paradise that had a beautiful view, fantastic beaches and diving sites – and we were being paid for it.”</p> \n<p>It begins with Begin</p> \n<p>The story of Operation Brothers actually dated back to 1977 and the election of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Reports came into Israel that Ethiopian Jews had started fleeing the civil war and famine in their homeland, many heading to neighboring Sudan where they were being housed in refugee camps. Although Sudan was a predominantly Muslim state hostile to Israel, its geographical location made it a perfect pathway for Ethiopians hoping to continue on to the Jewish state. Begin summoned then-head of the Mossad, Yitzhak Hofi, to see what could be done.</p> \n<p>But it was only four years later that the Mossad began scouting the Sudanese coastline, looking for locations where the Israel Navy could pick up groups of Ethiopian Jews and transport them to Israel.</p> \n<p>It discovered a picturesque group of 15 empty beachside villas (complete with kitchen and dining room) that had been built by Italian entrepreneurs a decade earlier, in 1972. However, the site had been abandoned when the Sudanese authorities failed to provide the promised access road, and water and electricity.</p> \n<p>Deciding that the deserted holiday village could be an ideal staging area from which to smuggle the Ethiopians to Israel by sea, the Mossad hatched its plan.</p> \n<p>The Sudanese Tourist Corporation believed it was renting the resort – for the princely sum of $320,000 – to a Swiss company eager to create a new getaway destination. Of course, the company’s “European” managers, diving instructors and windsurfing coaches were all actually Israeli intelligence operatives.</p> \n<p>The Mossad leased the resort for three years and placed a handful of key agents there. They were charged with renovating it, hooking it up to the electricity and water, and turning it into a fully staffed, sun-and-fun tourist operation.</p> \n<p>The local employees knew nothing of the resort’s real goal, or the real identities of their bosses. And the guests who eventually stayed at the resort – making it such a success it even turned a profit – were also unaware of its true purpose. Save for one, as Shimron recounts in his book.</p> \n<p>This guest, from Canada, caused panic when he took a diving instructor aside and stated, matter-of-factly and in Hebrew, that he knew the staff couldn’t possibly be European. In fact, he was sure they were Israelis. The guest was Jewish and had previously volunteered at a kibbutz. He had watched the staffers prepare their breakfast every morning – and “only Israelis cut their salad vegetables so thin,” he said. To the agent’s relief, the guest kept the secret to himself.</p> \n<p>The Sudanese staff might have similarly suspected something was odd about their employers’ habits – such as teaching the staff how to bake sweet, braided bread each Friday for their special “Sabbath cake.” The bosses would also disappear frequently and return exhausted when, using various excuses, they would be engaged in their true mission.</p> \n<p>Humanitarian mission</p> \n<p>Looking back, Shimron says Operation Brothers was a unique opportunity for the Mossad operatives, whose missions invariably involved bloodshed and conflict. Instead, in Sudan they got to play a key role in a humanitarian mission – one he believes is unique in the history of intelligence operations.</p> \n<p>As he writes in his memoir, “What other developed country would be ready to invest tens of millions of dollars to set up an operational infrastructure for secret activity in an enemy country, involving large army forces, only to save several thousand famished refugees in civil war-torn Africa?”</p> \n<p>Filmmaker Raff approached Shimron three years ago to discuss formally optioning the book, Shimron says, but ultimately chose to create his own version of events using the accounts of other participants in the mission. It’s a choice Shimron says left him “disappointed, but not bitter.” And though he worries that the upcoming film “will be a Hollywood-style movie” that emphasizes American participation and won’t accurately capture the covert actions, Shimron says he’s still pleased this little-known story will be told to a global audience.</p> \n<p>Shimron stresses it’s important to remember that the bravest people in the story aren’t the Mossad operatives, but those Ethiopian Jews who endured endless hardships trying to reach Israel by land, sea or air.</p> \n<p>His book contains descriptions of these stoic, uncomplaining men, women and children who crowded into trucks, hid in wadis and climbed into small boats or planes with no idea where they were headed, but with utter trust in their rescuers.</p> \n<p>“They are the real heroes of the stories, not us,” Shimron tells Haaretz. “What they went through in order to fulfill their dream to come to Zion – no normal Israeli or any Westerner could have endured for even three days.”</p> \n<p>One possible reason Operation Brothers has been largely overlooked is that the total number of Ethiopians the operatives were able to send to Israel was relatively small over three years, compared to the more dramatic Operation Moses, which airlifted more than 7,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel from Sudan (via Brussels) in less than three months, between November 21, 1984 and January 5, 1985.</p> \n<p>But in Shimron’s telling, the substantial amount of time, energy and money expended by the Mossad during Operation Brothers reflects the depth of Israel’s commitment to bringing the Ethiopian Jews to Israel, and saving as many as possible from the famine, war and turmoil they were facing in Sudanese refugee camps.</p> \n<p>Still, the success of Operation Moses was the beginning of the end for the Arous adventure. Shortly afterward, when Sudanese dictator Gen. Gaafar Nimeiry was toppled by a coup in April 1985, the remaining Israelis were evacuated from the resort and the holiday was over.</p> \n<p>Keeping their distance</p> \n<p>Though they had accompanied the Ethiopian Jews through their traumatic experience and admired them deeply, Shimron says security protocol dictated that the Mossad men keep their distance from their human cargo and hide their identities while transporting them to Arous.

        "text":["<p>George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st U.S. president who died Friday at the age of 94, was seen as having a rather frosty relationship with American Jews and Israel. But it was a reputation earned mostly from a single comment by an angry and at the time popular president, taking aim at the pro-Israel lobby trying to override him.</p> \n<p>It was September 12, 1991, the day hundreds of American Israel Public Affairs Committee supporters took to the halls of Congress to push for $10 million in loan guarantees for Israel – to help build new housing for the wave of Jewish immigrants flooding the Jewish state from the crumbling Soviet Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bush did not have a problem with the funding in principle. But he did not want the money to be used for homes in Jewish settlements in Gaza or the West Bank. Israel's then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir would not budge, and instead gave the green light to AIPAC to send its members to Capitol Hill to shore up congressional support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, down the road at the White House, a clearly annoyed Bush told a news conference that he was “up against some powerful political forces.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I heard today there was something like 1,000 lobbyists on the Hill working on the other side of the question. We’ve got one lonely little guy down here doing it,” he told reporters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Those words not only shocked and cowed the American-Jewish community, sensitive to accusations of dual loyalty. They also led members of Congress to tell AIPAC to cool its approach. Almost immediately, support for the loan guarantees withered (though they would be granted later in a deal overseen by Yitzhak Rabin, who succeeded Shamir as prime minister).</p> \n<p>Some Jewish leaders approached Bush afterward and warned that his comments would stir up anti-Semitic sentiment in the United States – a warning not borne out by subsequent events.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Malcolm Hoenlein, former head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, helped organize the AIPAC lobbying push in 1991. And he was there afterward when Bush received a delegation from the group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I literally saw tears in his eyes,” Hoenlein recounted. “He kept saying he regretted [the comments].”</p> \n<p>Another infamous comment emerged from the Bush administration, though this was not by the president himself but his secretary of state, James Baker. He reportedly told an associate in private, “F*** the Jews; they didn't vote for us anyway.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hoenlein said of relations between the Jewish community and Bush, “It was a roller-coaster relationship, but there were many good things about it. It is hard to characterize. I think people mischaracterize it unfairly, forgetting that he played a key role in the rescue of the Ethiopian Jews, Russian Jews and Syrian Jews,” he said.</p> \n<p>In addition to helping oversee the airlifts of Ethiopian Jews, and assisting with the immigration of Soviet and Syrian Jews, the Bush administration also helped coax various countries – most notably the Soviet Union and China – toward opening diplomatic relations with Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It was also the Bush administration that helped quell Israel’s foe, Iraq, in the first Gulf War in 1991. And after that war it was Baker who orchestrated the Madrid Peace Conference, bringing Israel to the negotiating table with all of its Arab neighbors for the first – and to date only – time.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And it was the Bush White House that, in December 1991, helped successfully revoke the UN resolution equating Zionism with racism and racial discrimination, which had been introduced in 1975.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“He was always available and open.&nbsp; I had numerous meetings with him, and you could see his visceral reaction against racism and anti-Semitism,” Hoenlein recalled.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>What Bush did not have was the emotional attachment to Israel and the Jewish community that Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had before and after him. It was also something his son, George W. Bush, exhibited in bear hugs with then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and by giving near-carte blanche approval to Israeli positions and policies.</p> \n<p>But despite the often prickly relations between Bush and the intensely ideological Shamir – especially their squabbles over settlement expansion – the pair coordinated positions as Bush prepared the groundwork for the first Gulf War at the start of 1991.</p> \n<p>Shamir agreed to the U.S. request not to counterattack should Israel come under fire from Iraq, even though doing so would break one of Israel’s longest-standing defense codes.&nbsp; The United States, in turn, defended Israel with Patriot anti-missile batteries, which worked for the most part. And Shamir stood true to his word amid the missiles that hit and resulted in a handful of Israeli deaths.</p> \n<p>After the war, military relations between the countries accelerated to the unprecedented level of intelligence-sharing and joint exercises of modern times. One notable example is the Arrow anti-ballistic missile project that Bush agreed to finance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bush told Congress in March 1991, “The time has come to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict.” Secretary of State Baker then embarked on months of shuttle diplomacy to the Middle East; his straight-talking approach with both Israelis and neighboring Arab countries managed to engineer the Madrid Conference seven months later.</p> \n<p>“James Baker was really the one calling the shots. Even though he [Bush] had that incredible foreign affairs background of his own, being president you have so much to do and he was willing to delegate much more than other presidents,” explained Morris J. Amitay, a Washington lobbyist and former executive director of AIPAC.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Baker also worked with senior staffers who were sympathetic to Israel and he listened to them.&nbsp; It was Baker who assembled, for the first time, a group of foreign policy experts – Dennis Ross, Aaron Miller and Daniel Kurtzer – to help plan for Madrid. These would go on to play important roles in U.S. peacemaking efforts.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The trio, along with Richard Haass (then a National Security Council official), were criticized by both Arabs and Israelis.&nbsp; Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Shamir’s closest advisers labeled them “Baker’s Jew boys.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“There was tension between the right-wing Israeli government and the Jewish team under Baker who basically supported the Labor Party outlook,” said Prof. Jonathan Rynhold, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, who specializes in U.S.-Israel relations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Madrid Conference, Rynhold said, “was a success, but a limited one. It got everyone in the room – and that’s not to be belittled.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Oslo peace process would follow in 1992, after Madrid fell apart.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In retirement Bush grew close to Bill Clinton, the man who beat him in the 1992 presidential election – an election in which Bush failed to win most of the Jewish vote.</p> \n<p>The two worked together as former presidents in the aftermath of&nbsp; two natural disasters: the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004) and Hurricane Katrina (2005), and struck up an unlikely but heartfelt friendship.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2012, Clinton and George W. Bush appeared at an event together. Clinton, referring to the younger Bush, told the crowd, “I like him, and I love his father.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Bush joined the Seeds of Peace organization’s advisory board in 2004. The group began its activity by bringing together teenagers from Israel, the occupied territories and Arab countries, and later expanded to other conflict zones around the world.</p> \n<p>He met a delegation of teenagers from the group in 2016, but spent much of the last decade of his life out of the limelight.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel, one of the most densely populated countries on Earth, turns out to have been harboring an unknown species of butterfly. Nor was the insect lurking in some dank hole: it was discovered flying about Israel's only ski resort, Mount Hermon, by an entomologist and evolutionary biologist named Vladimir Lukhtanov from the Zoological Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p> \n<p>Lukhtanov says he was surprised that nobody ever realized this high-altitude fritillary (Melitaea acentria) was unknown to science.</p> \n<p>&quot;Thousands of people had observed and many had even photographed this beautifully colored butterfly, yet no one recognized it as a separate species,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>That is because most people don't spend their time peering at lepidopteran genitalia and thought the thing belonged to the common species called Persian fritillary, which looks, well, the same.</p> \n<p>But as Lukhtanov describes in Comparative Cytogenetics, he and his students did that very thing in 2012, while carrying out a broad study of Israeli butterflies, and noticed something odd.</p> \n<p>The genitals of the male Hermon fritillaries were unlike those of Persian fritillaries, though otherwise the butterfly species are phenotypically similar.</p> \n<p>They then sequenced the butterflies and Lukhtanov, with his student Asya Novikova, discovered that the Hermon variant to be an unknown species. It also exists in Syria and Lebanon.</p> \n<p>&quot;The species is probably one of a handful of butterflies known to have arisen through hybridization between two other species in the past,&quot; says Lukhtanov. &quot;This process is known to be common in plants, but scientists have only recently realized it might also be present in butterflies.&quot;</p> \n<p>If so, the hybridization was not recent. A DNA barcode-based phylogeographic study showed the population to be ancient, possibly around 1.6 million years, say the scientists.</p> \n<p>This is the first new butterfly species discovered and described from the territory of Israel in 109 years. Previously unknown plant species have also been found, such as a variant species of Colchicum flowers in the Negev. Much like the butterfly on the Hermon, it took a fine eye to notice the difference between it and other Colchicums, and again, the difference lay in the sex organs.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Over 30 buses stood next to the museum in Kibbutz Ginosar last week, where a small, wooden, 2,000-year-old boat was the main attraction. Hundreds of tourists crowded into the spacious museum, built around the remains of the boat that has been dubbed “the Jesus boat” – though the “ancient Galilee boat from Jesus’ time” would perhaps be more accurate. Its owners were allegedly fishermen from the time of the Christian messiah.</p> \n<p>The huge thirst of Christian tourists to see something of the man whom they believe walked on water arouses the simplest and most obvious of questions: How is it possible that the most famous person in the Western world – some might say the most famous Jew ever – doesn’t have a museum of his own in Israel? And why are we not taking advantage of the fact that the Christian messiah was born and lived here, and turning that into a tourist attraction?</p> \n<p>After all, we want as many tourists to visit Israel as possible, and there are some 2 billion Christian believers worldwide. A visitor center devoted to their messiah would presumably attract millions, so how is it possible we decided to relinquish this natural asset?</p> \n<p>Jesus of Nazareth was born in Bethlehem, and lived and worked in the Galilee and Jerusalem some 2,000 years ago. There are prominent traces of him at many local sites: Nazareth; the shores of Lake Kinneret; the Galilee region; Kafr Kana; Capernaum; Mount Tabor; the Mount of Beatitudes; Jerusalem; the banks of the Jordan.</p> \n<p>And though it would seem pretty obvious that a museum would tell the story of Jesus accessibly and for popular consumption, there is no such significant institution in Israel. No one has risen to the challenge.</p> \n<p>Last month, the Museum of the Bible was dedicated in Washington. The billionaire Green family, evangelical Christians, invested a reported $500 million in the construction of this huge, nine-story museum. One of the wings is devoted to the story of Jesus in Galilee, and tourists are invited to walk in his footsteps in halls filled with archaeological findings and sophisticated electronic exhibits. Some of the findings even came from the Israel Antiquities Authority.</p> \n<p>According to American tourism experts, the museum will attract 8 million visitors a year. Israel, by comparison, expects 3.5 million tourist visits for the entire country this year.</p> \n<p>There are attractions in Israel, of course: Nazareth Village was built in 2000 as an initiative by Dr. Nakhle Bishara and with a $1-million donation from U.S. millionaire Sherry Herschend (of the Herschend Family Entertainment Corp.). The site recreates the way of life in the Galilee at the beginning of the Roman period and shows everyday life in Jesus’ time. The people behind the Nazareth Village also worked on the World of Jesus of Nazareth exhibit at Washington’s Museum of the Bible. The Mary International Center, which was established by the French religious community of Chemin Neuf, is located next to the Basilica of the Annunciation in Nazareth. It offers an introduction to the biblical landscapes and lifestyle of Jesus and his mother, Mary. And the Terra Sancta Museum, from the Franciscan friars of the Custody of the Holy Land, can be found on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem’s Old City. It is devoted to archaeological discoveries and findings from the years of the Christian communities’ development in Israel.</p> \n<p>But none of these sites is a significant tourist attraction. Experts on Christian tourism, archaeology, preservation, museology, architecture, development and entrepreneurship have lots of thoughts on how it’s possible there’s no major museum devoted to Jesus – in Jerusalem, Nazareth or anywhere else. But there’s no consensus.</p> \n<p>Your own personal Jesus</p> \n<p>Prof. Gideon Avni, head of the archaeological digs and research division at the Antiquities Authority, explains that there are countless differences of opinion among Christian denominations regarding the story of Jesus and his life in Israel.</p> \n<p>“Everyone has his own Jesus,” says Avni. “Even his place of burial was disputed for hundreds of years between the Catholics – who believe the tomb is in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre [in the Old City] – and the Protestants, who pointed to the Garden Tomb.</p> \n<p>“Building a Jesus museum is dangerous because it would force us to choose one ‘story’ and favor it over the others,” he continues. “That is liable to arouse anger among the various Christian denominations. In the current situation there are way stations – a kind of route throughout the country. The pilgrims pass among these way stations and each matches the route to his own story.”</p> \n<p>Providing an example of the problematic nature of choosing one narrative, Avni points to the current exhibition “Tomb of Christ: The Church of the Holy Sepulchre Experience,” at the National Geographic Museum in Washington. The curators adopted the Greek version (the tomb restoration was conducted by a team from Athens) and many communities were angered by this choice. Avni says building a Jesus museum in Israel would create a similar problem because of internal Christian disputes.</p> \n<p>When asked what might be displayed in a Jesus museum, Avni says you could “present the Jewish way of life in Second Temple times – that was Jesus’ way of life. And that is especially true for Jerusalem. We know next-to-nothing about Nazareth in Jesus’ time because it was a very small place. Nor do we have any findings related to the man himself.”</p> \n<p>According to Avni, the question of building a museum in the Galilee never arose. On the other hand, he notes, there is a constant demand to illustrate what life was like in the Galilee and Jerusalem in Jesus’ time. This need is met by conventional exhibitions or displays that show the country in Second Temple times, Avni says.</p> \n<p>The entire country is a museum</p> \n<p>Father Juan Solana is a Catholic priest, director of Jerusalem’s Notre Dame Center and head of the Legionaries of Christ congregation in Israel. He has invested great efforts in recent years in the development of the Christian site at Magdala, on the shores of the Kinneret. He believes that the entire Holy Land is a “Jesus museum” and therefore there’s no need to build another site. “When you come to Israel as a pilgrim and visit the holy sites – the entire country is your museum,” he says. “Such a visit provides pilgrims with the necessary insights about Jesus’ life. They experience Jesus’ life in the places where he walked.”</p> \n<p>Solana also wonders what could be displayed in such a museum if it were to be built. He says there is no single item that can be attributed to Jesus that would constitute part of a concrete and dignified display. At the same time, it’s important to him to explain that just because he sees the entire country as a Jesus museum, the sites sacred to Christianity still need to be properly developed. The existing infrastructure is far from satisfactory, he notes.</p> \n<p>Hana Bendcowsky, a tour guide on Christian issues and program director of the Jerusalem Center for Jewish-Christian Relations, points to the Israeli fear of dealing with Christianity as a central problem. She says that sensitivity is both political and religious, and, because of it, Israel is not realizing its tourism potential.</p> \n<p>“For thousands of years, Christianity was our ultimate enemy – and now it’s hard for us to make the change,” she says. “There’s a genuine difficulty and complexity here that is also reflected in the activity of the Tourism Ministry. They don’t invest in Christian tourism, they have no experts who understand the subject, and their main marketing effort is now in other directions – beaches, cities, entertainment, sports, etc. The word ‘resurrection’ – a central concept in Christianity – doesn’t appear in official publications at all.”</p> \n<p>Bendcowsky offers several examples she believes prove Israel’s tremendous and unexploited potential for Christian tourism: the museum in Ginosar; the Qumran Caves in the Judean Desert, which attract hundreds of thousands of tourists each year; and Yardenit (aka the Yardenit Baptismal Site), next to Lake Kinneret, which is visited by over 250,000 tourists annually.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Bendcowsky also wonders whether there is a need for a Jesus museum. “Anyone who comes here as a pilgrim doesn’t need a museum. He already arrives with the story from home. It may be preferable to concentrate on the development of the Christian sites, which are not in good shape.”</p> \n<p>‘Jesus of Nazareth’ brand</p> \n<p>About 10 years ago, Maoz Yinon – a co-owner of the Abraham Hostels chain – conceived and marked the Jesus Trail in the Galilee, from Nazareth to Lake Kinneret. He tells Haaretz that the teachings of Jesus contradict the Zionist narrative. “Here, we’re supposed to be familiar with the Maccabees and Samson the mighty hero. A person who tells people to turn the other cheek doesn’t suit us.”</p> \n<p>Yinon sees this attitude as a big cultural mistake that causes tremendous damage to the Israeli economy. He says there is wilful ignorance here, which is cultivated to assume huge dimensions.</p> \n<p>“The heritage of Jesus has tremendous tourism potential, none of which is being exploited at present,” he says. “It has no connection to the question of the faith of most of the population here. Every year, tens of thousands of tourists walk in the path of the Incas in Peru – and none of them is Incan. Lots of people could make a living from it regardless of whether or not he is the messiah – something billions of people believe – and we decide to ignore that due to fanaticism.”</p> \n<p>Yinon believes Nazareth would be the best place for a Jesus museum: Jerusalem is too sensitive, and the entire world is familiar with the “Jesus of Nazareth” brand. He thinks it should become a government policy, which would bring prosperity to the residents of Nazareth and the Galilee.</p> \n<p>He laughs when asked if, as a successful businessman, he might tackle such a project. “After my experience with the Israeli establishment, I wouldn’t go near such a project! I have no doubt that even if private entrepreneurs come and try to promote the initiative, everything possible will be done to make them fail. You have to be really obsessed with the idea, and then maybe it will succeed.”</p> \n<p>David Gafni is a veteran architect who specializes in building museums. Among other things, he worked on the design of the Yad Mordechai Museum, the visitor center in Timna Park and Yad Vashem’s Holocaust History Museum. He says a Jesus museum hasn’t been built until now, either through public or private funding, because nobody has initiated such a thing. He believes the religious circles in Israel wouldn’t allow such a thing and would stop it at the earliest stage. “A museum that will present the life of Jesus and the characteristics of the period objectively can only be built through independent entrepreneurs and financiers,” he says.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Gafni is skeptical about the justification for building a museum around one person, as famous and important as he may be. As an example, he cites the museum in memory of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Ramat Aviv – a large and impressive museum that shortly after its inception became the Israeli Museum at the Yitzhak Rabin Center.</p> \n<p>Gafni adds that many churches have “information centers” and “museum-like visitor centers” around the figure of Jesus. These include Gethsemane (at the foot of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem), the Church of the Nativity (in Bethlehem), the Church of the Loaves and Fishes (on the shores of Lake Kinneret), Capernaum (also Lake Kinneret), the Mount of Beatitudes (northern Israel), the Church of the Annunciation, and more. Each church has its own special atmosphere, he notes: from the archaeological and historical surroundings and unique fa&ccedil;ade, to the statues, stained-glass windows and music, choirs, candles and spices. All these combine to create an exalted experience for many of the visitors.</p> \n<p>Fear of Christianity</p> \n<p>The Israel Museum in Jerusalem has several exhibits dealing with Jesus’ life and times. The museum recently issued a detailed brochure that offers a “Christian route” to tour guides visiting the museum with groups of Christian tourists. This is a route along which you can view a dozen findings and works of importance to the history of Christianity in the Holy Land.</p> \n<p>Dudi Mevorach is a senior curator at the Israel Museum for the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods, and he also curated the 2013 Herod exhibition there. He says there is a concerted effort to convey to the Christian world and tourists that the museum offers a large number of exhibits that are relevant to the first moments of Christianity.</p> \n<p>The outstanding exhibits on the museum’s Christian route include a model of Jerusalem during the Second Temple period; the Dead Sea Scrolls; the House of David inscription; the ossuary of the high priest Caiaphas (who arrested and investigated Jesus before he was handed over to the Romans); the Latin dedicatory inscription mentioning Pontius Pilate (the prefect who ordered Jesus’ crucifixion), and more.</p> \n<p>Mevorach explains that until now, no Christian or Jesus wing has been established in the museum because it’s important to see things in their overall context. “The context is important when you come to tell the story of Jesus’ times. That’s why we chose to display several exhibits in what we call the ‘Christian corner,’ but no more than that.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Amitai Mendelsohn’s doctorate and a large exhibit he curated at the Israel Museum were devoted to Jesus’ place in Israeli art. He explains that the country is full of hundreds of Christian sites, but this is purposefully ignored in Israeli society and the Israeli educational system. “There is a great fear in Judaism of any appearance of Christianity – and yet the figure of Jesus has become present in art and Hebrew literature,” he says, adding that the exhibition he curated on the subject aroused much curiosity and interest.</p> \n<p>Mendelsohn adds that while the contemporary Catholic Church has great respect for the state and Judaism, the chances of a Jesus museum being established in Israel are slim. He says it is a sensitive political question. And though Christian sites in Israel are popular among tourists, they receive very few Israeli visitors, he notes. “The question is the extent to which we, the Jews, who built the state as a refuge from the Christian world, are capable of accepting the presentation of Jesus here and containing this tribute. And the answer is still in the negative.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley indirectly threatened on Tuesday to withdraw U.S. support for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. Asked by a journalist about continued U.S. funding for the UN agency, she stated that President Donald Trump “doesn’t want to give any additional funding until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table. The Palestinians now have to show the world they want to come to the table. As of now, they’re not coming to the table but they ask for aid.”</p> \n<p>Though Haley didn’t refer to the UN agency by name and it is unclear if she specifically meant it or other U.S. funding for the Palestinians – and a spokesman for the agency said it hadn’t been informed by the United States of any changes in its funding policies – critics of UNRWA applauded Haley’s remarks.</p> \n<p>To really understand the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Her comments came after the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn President Donald Trump’s recognition last month of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. They also came in tandem with Trump tweets saying that “we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect,” and with “the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?”</p> \n<p>The UN agency has been a lightning rod of controversy for decades, harshly criticized by Israel and its advocates. Indeed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went as far last June as to call for it to be “dismantled.”</p> \n<p>But the Trump administration reportedly rejected that call, with Haley herself pledging last August to maintain the current U.S. levels of support – in keeping with the U.S. policy of supporting the critical humanitarian work the agency performs (feeding, educating and providing health care for Palestinians).</p> \n<p>But despite Israel’s loud and frequent public criticism, many question whether it really wants to see the agency shuttered or crippled. They say it quietly needs the agency to continue shouldering the burden of tending to the critical humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians – for fear their care would spark a humanitarian crisis that would fall on Israel if it were not in place.</p> \n<p>Even the agency’s harshest critics in Israel view its dismantling as an unrealistic goal.</p> \n<p>What is UNRWA, and what does it do?</p> \n<p>The agency describes its mission as providing “assistance and protection for some 5 million registered Palestine refugees” in the areas of education, health care, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, microfinance and emergency assistance, including in times of armed conflict.</p> \n<p>It receives some of its funding from the main UN budget, primarily for staff. But the bulk of its funds are “voluntary contributions” from UN member states. The agency was set up by the General Assembly in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and began operating in 1950. Since then, its mandate has been periodically renewed by the General Assembly.</p> \n<p>On its website, it acknowledges that it is “unique in terms of its long-standing commitment to one group of refugees.”</p> \n<p>It also has a different criteria for refugee status. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is responsible for every other refugee group besides Palestinians, does not automatically confer refugee status to descendants of refugees. But UNRWA grants refugee status to “descendants of fathers” who are refugees – which is why the number of Palestinians under the UNRWA mandate grows significantly from year to year.</p> \n<p>It defines its clients as “persons whose normal place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict,” and “descendants of fathers fulfilling the definition.” The agency operates in the following areas: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>When it was created, the agency served some 750,000 Palestine refugees. Today, some 5 million Palestine refugees are eligible for its services.</p> \n<p>Who funds the agency?</p> \n<p>The United States is the largest bilateral donor to the agency since 1949. It contributed nearly $370 million in 2016 – about a quarter of the agency’s budget – followed by the European Union, Saudi Arabia, Germany and the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>What is Israel’s position on UNRWA?</p> \n<p>Israeli leaders have never been fans of the UN agency. First and foremost, Israel challenges its broad definition of “refugee,” which is predicated on an assumption that the millions of Palestinians it serves are refugees waiting to return to the homeland from which they (or their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents) were banished.</p> \n<p>But beyond what it see as support for a pro-Palestinian narrative, Israel and its advocates have charged over the years that the agency does real damage breeding incitement and hate in its educational institutions. Furthermore, that it provides aid, shelter and financial support to people and groups that Israel and other nations define as terrorists. This holds particularly true in the Gaza Strip, where Israel contends that because the UN agency shoulders so much of the educational and health care burden there, it has freed up the ruling Hamas regime to use its resources on attack tunnels and rockets that threaten Israel.</p> \n<p>At a meeting covered by the international media last June, Netanyahu declared publicly and unequivocally what many other Israeli leaders had been saying in private for years – that the agency should be shuttered and the UN should treat the Palestinians like all other refugees.</p> \n<p>“I told U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley that it’s time to dismantle UNRWA,” Netanyahu announced, following the news that the agency had found a cross-border tunnel designed to attack Israel running under two of its schools in the Gaza Strip. “It is time for the UN to reexamine UNRWA’s existence. UNRWA, to a great extent, by its existence and unfortunately by its actions too from time to time, perpetuates the Palestinians’ problem instead of solving it. Therefore, it is time that UNRWA be dismantled and merged with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees,” Netanyahu declared.</p> \n<p>Why does Israel hate the agency so much and advocate for its dismantlement?</p> \n<p>Israel’s list of grievances against the agency is lengthy and spans decades. Over the years, a regular target has been the education network, where Israelis charge that generations of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have been taught to hate the Jewish state in UNRWA-funded schools and military-style summer camps that teach resistance and opposition to peace negotiations.</p> \n<p>Workers employed by the UN agency are officially forbidden from political involvement and must remain nonpartisan. In practice, though, the organization has failed to implement that. Hamas members are known to be on the agency’s payroll, leading to charges that UNRWA indirectly supports the regime and its workers unions are under Hamas’ control.</p> \n<p>During the 2014 Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas (and other Islamist militant groups), the UN agency was involved in controversy almost daily. It faced allegations from Israel that rocket launchers and missile stockpiles were located in its facilities; that “terror tunnels” were dug beneath them; and that its ambulances were used for military purposes.</p> \n<p>It was during this war that the agency’s spokesman, Chris Gunness, famously broke down over the deaths of Palestinians who had been shelled while seeking shelter in a UN school. “The rights of Palestinians, even their children, are wholesale denied – and it’s appalling,” he said, before bursting into tears.</p> \n<p>Why has Israel refrained from making a real push to dismantle UNRWA until the Trump era?</p> \n<p>Over the years, the Israeli government has played something of a double game when it comes to the UN agency. While it has been genuinely angered at much of UNRWA’s behavior, it has quietly acknowledged that its elimination could make the situation more difficult, not easier – even if strong opposition from Arab and European countries to such a move could be overcome.</p> \n<p>With the agency currently maintaining vital services in health care – including providing vaccines, sanitation and water supply – a drastic reduction or elimination of their services could potentially spark a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Daniel B. Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel and currently a fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, said Israel – including the Netanyahu government – has previously put the brakes on efforts in Washington to stop its funding for the agency because of such concerns.</p> \n<p>“On many occasions in the past, Congress has slowed or conditioned assistance to the Palestinian Authority because of incitement, refusal to come to negotiations or other valid concerns. UNRWA has also been a source of frustration because of its role in perpetuating the Palestinian refugee problem, rather than rehabilitating them,” Shapiro said. “But on each occasion, the Israeli government has quietly been among the most influential advocates in getting Congress eventually to release the funds. For all the legitimate frustrations, that aid serves Israeli – and U.S. – interests by helping maintain the stability of the PA and providing for the legitimate needs of Palestinian refugees. Without it, Israel’s security could be harmed by the collapse of the PA, and Israel would have to take on the burdens of providing for refugees’ needs that UNRWA currently does.</p> \n<p>“In an honest dialogue between Israel and the Trump administration,” Shapiro added, “I would expect similar issues to be raised and for the lion’s share of that assistance to continue, while still trying to use it for leverage to get the Palestinians to negotiate and address other concerns.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>By 2014, New York City realized that pay phones had become an anachronism. That year the city launched a cooperative venture with large technology companies called LinkNYC, which replaced hundreds of pay phones with new Internet-enabled kiosks. Each kiosk provided superfast, free public Wi-Fi, phone calls, device charging and a tablet for access to city services, maps and directions.</p> \n<p>What happened, however, is that homeless people began to hog the kiosks, and some were using them to watch pornography in public. In September, yielding to a stream of complaints, the city disabled the web-browsing feature.</p> \n<p>This illustrates just part of the complexity of what’s being called the “smart city.” It’s a trendy term that mayors and anyone who deals with technology and urban planning like to use, but it’s also elusive. There are far more stories of failures and millions of dollars that went to waste, than there are of successes.</p> \n<p>Research on the subject here in Israel has been done by the Knesset Research and Information Center, led by researcher Roy Goldschmidt. The research highlights the importance and urgent need to develop and implement new technological solutions for transportation, energy use, water, waste disposal and policing in a world of rapid urbanization – but it also raises questions and problems. Israel, as a start-up nation, “could be a place for testing, implementing and later exporting projects and technologies in the field,” Goldschmidt writes. But it’s hard to say that Israel is at the forefront of these fields.</p> \n<p>What is a smart city? According to Goldschmidt, there is no single definition of the term, which is often used to brand and market cities. “There’s a definition that stressed the use of technological tools, like sensors and communication networks, to collect and monitor the information received from them to streamline urban processes and provide decision-makers with real-time reports.”</p> \n<p>A “softer” definition, he writes, refers to municipal applications and digital platforms as tools to promote public involvement in decision making and transparency.</p> \n<p>The Knesset study raises problems posed by the smart city, like perpetuating inequality. “While certain cities have difficulty supplying basic services to their residents, other cities offer advanced digital applications, innovate transportation solutions and more,” Goldschmidt writes. “It’s clear that there are gaps between the ability of cities to invest in technology and innovation, like parking sensors and lighting.”</p> \n<p>Even among residents of the same city there are differences in ability to adapt and use technology, what is often referred to as the “digital divide.” Urban innovation, noted Goldschmidt, must be used to advance and enrich everyone.</p> \n<p>The second challenge posed by smart cities is preserving privacy and preventing cyber attacks. “The growing use of products that make extensive use of sensors and extensive documentation of what’s happening around them, along with technologies like surveillance cameras, location-based information and the like – all these can be expected to create a situation that will even further challenge both privacy and cyber defense,” Goldschmidt writes.</p> \n<p>Just a few weeks ago, security researcher Amihai Neiderman demonstrated at a security conference how he was able to hack Tel Aviv’s Wi-Fi network, Free_TLV. The Tel Aviv municipality has stated in the past that although the city is monitored by 160 surveillance cameras, these result in very few police calls – eight in 2013 and 15 in 2014.</p> \n<p>A third problem with smart cities is the relationship between the municipalities and the technology suppliers, with Cisco, IBM, Motorola Solutions, Intel and Microsoft all players in the smart city technology arena. Too often it will be the supplier who dictates the solution, while there’s also the problem of being dependent on a single supplier. Goldschmidt says the way to reduce such dependence is by using open code systems that can interface with other systems.</p> \n<p>A fourth challenge is connectivity. Smart cities need Internet infrastructures that are advanced, inexpensive and available. Advanced services based on video need heavy broadband access. The Communications Ministry, the Knesset report says, has already warned that the wide use of smart-city technology could lead to problems in conveying huge quantities of information on wireless infrastructure, which will make it necessary to lay fixed cables in the cities.</p> \n<p>First steps</p> \n<p>The Knesset reports surveys several smart-city experiments in Israel. Tel Aviv is promoting the DigiTel resident’s card, which offers residents discounts and relevant updates based on the resident’s location and personal interests. Holon has set up solar installations in the roofs of schools to produce electricity. Rishon Letzion and Givatayim have introduced smart systems to collect household waste, Haifa has a computerized system for street cleaning, and in Ashdod they’ve installed a control system for street lighting that it says saves hundreds of thousands of shekels a year.</p> \n<p>In August, Bezeq launched an experimental project in Modi’in that it described as “a full urban management system with a range of municipal services, including parking and smart transportation, trash collection, lighting, free web browsing on the city’s streets, security cameras for a smart and safe city, monitoring of the water and sewage systems and more.”</p> \n<p>For the second stage of the project, Bezeq turned to the mPrest company, which offers proven advanced command and control systems. It provided a solution that allows absolute computer-guided control that monitors a large number of sensors installed throughout the city, in schools, public institutions, municipal installations and public parks that convey information at all times and allow decisions to be made in real time. Mprest is a subsidiary of Rafael Advanced Weapons Sytems and GE; among its products is the command and control apparatus for the Iron Dome anti-missile system.</p> \n<p>“The park in Modi’in is our playground for the smart city issue,” says Yaki Zano, Bezeq’s vice president for technology. “We are always adding smart city censors to more areas and more fields. At this point we have three suppliers for trash collection, three for lighting, and other fields like security and parking. Some of the solutions are our idea, while some come from requests by the municipality, which is part of the issue for us. The Modi’in municipality is allowing us to expand the pilot project by integrating into its information systems and into its “Modi’in in the Palm of Your Hand” app.”</p> \n<p>Smart from the start</p> \n<p>Rafi Rich, the CEO of SUiTs (Smarter Urban IT and Strategies), a smart-cities consulting firm, believes in smart cities but says there’s a long way to go in implementing the vision.</p> \n<p>“Now everyone’s excited about the smart city,” he says. “It’s a little like sex among teenagers – everybody’s talking about it but no one is doing it. Control rooms with screens are nice, and make mayors ecstatic but in some cases the smart city is merely a combination of funding and desire to show that we’re ‘doing something.’</p> \n<p>“DigiTel is an interesting move that’s based on an information systems department of 400 people – that’s a monster. Many cities are excited about the technology, but they don’t have the ability to manage it or its risks, as in cyber [security] and privacy. If you’ve installed sensors all over and are collecting information, but you can’t produce any insights from this information, then the money has gone down the drain. If you’ve built a system but the regulatory regime restrains, then another few million have gone down the drain.”</p> \n<p>He explains: “Let’s take a city that has a serious problem with parking and public transportation, and the city wants to improve it. But in general cities have no say with regard to transportation, it’s all managed by the Transportation Ministry. If a municipality wants to streamline its waste collection and it adopts a smart garbage receptacle or an app that manages waste, but the sanitation company has a union, you think you’ll be able to streamline their work? Or if the sanitation company is an outside contractor and the contract with him is for five years – go tell them to pick up less trash.</p> \n<p>“There are a few successes in the world that we can learn from, like in Boston, where they launched a municipal application that’s linked to all operations teams in the field, and some 400,000 of the city’s 700,000 residents use it. Two-thirds of the calls to the city hotline come through the app and they’re dealt with within three hours. In Israel, if you look outside Tel Aviv, maybe 1% of residents have installed the municipal app that the municipality spent good money developing.”</p> \n<p>Rich recommends taking technological solutions in account from the start of the planning process, which he says is the only way to broaden the use of smart electricity grids and renewable energy. “I’m a partner in such a process now in Rova Hayam in Hadera, with an eye to what they want to do three years’ hence, when it’s much easier. The second thing is that in municipal tenders they must decide what the objective is, not what technology they want. If they want to reduce waste collection by 50%, that should be the measure – a measure of performance, not a specific technology.</p> \n<p>“The third thing is that the process must be led by the decision-makers and not by the computer and IT people. The role of IT is to provide solutions and screen out bad solutions, but the demand has to come from the top. I also think that cities have to use models of trial and terror – to launch small pilot projects, say, with a budget of $5,000, and what doesn’t work, dump.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Journalist Ari Shavit announced he is canceling his participation at a New York event after two women came forward with new allegations of sexual misconduct, the magazine Jewish Currents reported on Friday. When contacted by the magazine, Shavit did not deny the allegations. According to JTA, 92nd Street Y, the Jewish center which was planning to host the event featuring Shavit, has removed it from its website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to Jewish Currents, the new alleged incidents took place in 2014 and 2015. One of the women, Amna Farooqi, told the magazine that in October 2015, while she was head of J Street U's national student board, Shavit approached her during an event at the University of Maryland to promote his book 'My Promised Land.'&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;At the end of the conversation, we stood up, and while shaking hands, he leaned towards my face,&quot; said Farooqi, who was 22 at the time. &quot;I turned my head, and he was kissing the side of my mouth. I said nothing. I felt weird. I didn’t feel assaulted, I just kept thinking, ‘that was weird.’”</p> \n<p>The second allegation reported in the magazine refers to an incident that took place in January 2014 at Brandeis. The woman, Catriona Stewart, was 20 at the time and served as a J Street U student leader. According to Stewart, Shavit approached a group of students to in order to take a photograph. “I was excited to take a picture with him,&quot; she said. &quot;He had signed my book, and as I stood next to him for the picture he started to move his hand, rubbing me along my lower back it was touchier than I’d ever experienced from an adult I didn’t know.&quot;</p> \n<p>In October 2016 Shavit announced his resignation from Haaretz and Channel 10, after Jewish-American journalist Danielle Berrin accused him of trying to forcefully kiss and touch her during an interview. Following Berrin's accusation, a J Street staffer said Shavit 'groped' her hand and tried to call her afterwards several times.</p> \n<p>Following the allegations, Shavit told Jewish Currents he “left the public arena” more than a year ago to “begin a deep process of reckoning and self-reflection.” He added:“I continue to take responsibility for my actions. I’ve asked forgiveness from those whom I hurt and I am profoundly sorry for the pain I have caused.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Amazon made us wait eight months for “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” after airing the pilot episode way back in March. Usually, when there’s such a long gap between the pilot and the subsequent episodes of the show, viewers forget what happened and who the characters are.</p> \n<p>No such worries with this show.</p> \n<p>Anyone who saw the explosive pilot is unlikely to have forgotten Miriam “Midge” Maisel and her first drunken steps from perfect Jewish housewife in 1950s Manhattan to lewd stand-up comedienne.</p> \n<p>Midge, played by Rachel Brosnahan, is something of an enigma. Despite her mile-wide rebellious streak (she rejected her father’s advice that she study “something practical” at university to major in Russian literature, and she and her husband go to watch Lenny Bruce perform his stand-up in Greenwich Village) she aspires to and embraces the spoiled life of an affluent housewife.</p> \n<p>Her only concerns in life are the size of her baby daughter’s forehead and getting the rabbi to finally accept an invitation to break the Yom Kippur fast in her elegant Upper West Side apartment. She is so dedicated to her husband that she routinely waits until he has fallen asleep to remove her makeup, and gets up before he does to perfume and beautify herself.</p> \n<p>Very early on, however, she reveals her mischievous side. Not content with breaking all tradition by making a speech at her wedding (“Who gives a toast at her own wedding?” she asks, before answering, “I do!”), she ends by letting off a very non-kosher stink bomb, telling her guests that, “Yes, there is shrimp in the eggrolls.”</p> \n<p>Four years later, Midge has dutifully produced two children and is helping her untalented husband, Joel, played by Michael Zegen, in his efforts to become a stand-up comedian. She bribes the manager of the Gaslight Caf&eacute;&nbsp; – the famed Village hangout of beatniks, folk musicians and comics – with brisket, to get her husband a better timeslot for his set, which turns out to have been lifted, word for word, from Bob Newhart.</p> \n<p>Then, one night, Midge’s world collapses around her. After bombing at the Gaslight, Joel tells her he’s been having an affair with his secretary and is leaving. She breaks the news to her parents, played by Tony Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle, who assume that Midge must have driven her husband away and beseech her to “fix your face, put on his favorite dress; then you go out, find him, and make him come back home.”</p> \n<p>Midge, however, has other ideas. She gets drunk and takes an inebriated subway ride to the Village, where she barges into the Gaslight and demands the return of the Pyrex dish in which she cooked her brisket. Drunk, dressed only in a nightie and skimpy robe, Midge literally wanders on stage and start talking into the microphone.</p> \n<p>What follows is a five-minute, improvised, stream-of-consciousness comedy set that culminates in Midge getting arrested for public indecency after exposing her breasts and asking, “Who wouldn’t want to come home to these?”</p> \n<p>And so begins Midge’s tentative journey into comedy.</p> \n<p>Funny, but uneven</p> \n<p>As one would expect from a show made by the creator of “Gilmore Girls,” there is plenty of family drama in “Mrs. Maisel.” Amy Sherman-Palladino mastered the mother-daughter relationship with Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, and there are glimpses of that between Midge and her mother. The relationship between Midge’s and Joel’s parents, meanwhile, is comedic gold, and the domestic exchanges sparkle with witty dialog.</p> \n<p>Indeed, anytime Midge appears on screen, you can pretty much guarantee there will be clever comebacks and observations. It’s a sweeping performance by Brosnahan, who dominates the screen and well deserves the Golden Globe nomination she got for best actress. The show was also nominated for Best Television Musical or Comedy.</p> \n<p>There is, however, an unevenness to the show and its characters. The pace varies from rapid-fire gags to slow flashbacks and lingering long shots. Over the course of almost eight hours, Midge prevaricates between determination to pursue the life of a modern women – a single, working mother of two and a would-be comedienne – and her (and her parents’) desire to see her reunited with her husband, despite his many evident flaws and his infidelity.</p> \n<p>An argument could be made that “Mrs. Maisel” should have been a movie, since the plot does not progress much over the course of eight episodes and the dramatic catalyst occurs midway through the first episode.</p> \n<p>A two-hour film might have eliminated some of the less dynamic scenes and superfluous-but-entertaining tangents in which the show indulges. It could have pushed the plot forward at a more satisfying pace and ended with a triumphant, feel-good denouement. Having said that, critics and viewers clearly loved the show exactly as it is – it has a 95 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes – and Amazon executives have already commissioned a second season.</p> \n<p>If you are planning on watching “Mrs. Maisel,” however, take a tip from someone who watched all eight episodes over a single weekend: Don’t binge.</p> \n<p>The inherent problem with streaming services like Amazon and Netflix is the immediacy and availability of their output. New shows are not aired, they are dumped – and for those of us suffering from a chronic inability to defer gratification, the temptation to overconsume is overwhelming.</p> \n<p>That’s fine for cliffhanger shows, where you can’t wait to discover the next twist in the plot or the next major character to be killed off. “Mrs. Maisel” is a very different kind of show; the kind you should savor, week by week, and not the kind to be consumed in one sitting.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – Einat Admony has made a name for herself in New York City. The Israeli-born chef owns a few restaurants, like Balaboosta and Bar Bolonat, which have attracted a lot of interest. But there are those who say that her real forte is her two fast-food restaurants (actually two-and-a-half) called Tam&nbsp;that sell falafel in SoHo and the West Village. The “half” is a falafel truck that circulates around Manhattan.</p> \n<p>Now it seems that Admony’s falafel business is on the verge of a dramatic development. Admony has been joined by a number of investors and senior employees formerly associated with the Chipotle Mexican Grill fast-food chain, among them its former operations officer.</p> \n<p>Chipotle, an American-owned chain with branches in Canada and Europe, has faced difficulties in recent years, after several customers contracted food-borne illnesses and patrons began abandoning the chain in droves. Admony’s new partners have decided that falafel is better than organic Mexican food that has made some people sick.</p> \n<p>Admony, 45, says that five new local branches of Tam – which means “delicious” or “tasty” in Hebrew – will open in the next year or two. The third branch will open in central Manhattan in February, and in May two more will open: one in the Financial District in downtown Manhattan and the other in the Flatiron district, now the city's high-tech hub. They’re even talking about opening a branch in Washington, D.C.</p> \n<p>Tam serves two types of falafel and sabich (pita stuffed with hard-boiled eggs and eggplant) with different spreads and toppings, along with a variety of salads and smoothies. The crowd that frequenting its branches in the Village and SoHo is by and large young, with a liberal sprinkling of hipsters and students.</p> \n<p>Falafel has a presence in New York. It is served at a host of popular eateries, but also at chef restaurants. For example, the Maoz falafel chain, owned by Israelis who started their business in Holland, is doing well.</p> \n<p>Many consider falafel to be health food, because it’s vegetarian, but they tend to forget that it’s deep-fried, which casts its supposedly healthful properties in a dubious light. To counter that problem, chains like Whole Foods and Fairway, for instance, sell oven-baked falafel balls. They aren’t as tasty but presumably more healthful and better suited to the healthy-lifestyle craze that has consumed New York.</p> \n<p>While some efforts by Israelis to conquer the Big Apple with falafel didn’t go too well, chef Admony and her ex-Chipotle partners believe the popular Middle Eastern delicacy has great potential and want to try their luck.</p> \n<p>Bethany Strong, who was operations director at Chipotle from 2005 to 2013, is now vice president for operations at Tam. She says that there’s something about the falafel at Tam that reminds her of the early days at Chipotle: Once you taste it, she says, you’ll come back for more. And with so many people going vegetarian and vegan, falafel could be the next big thing.</p> \n<p>'Sky-high rent'</p> \n<p>Admony, who comes from a family of ba'alei teshuva (newly penitent individuals) from the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, spent her early young adulthood traveling the world. At 24 she took a short course at the Tadmor Hotelier School in Tel Aviv, after which she worked at several restaurants, including chef Haim Cohen’s Keren. After a brief, failed marriage, she returned to New York with $200 in her pocket, determined to make a new start. Shortly after her arrival she met the man whom she would soon marry, Stefan Nafziger, who was working at the Balthazar French restaurant, where he continued to work even after they opened their first Tam branch in the West Village in 2005.</p> \n<p>“The first year was hard,” Admony recalls. “People weren’t coming, there wasn’t a soul in the restaurant.” But things slowly started to pick up. In 2010 she opened Balaboosta in SoHo and two years later, the larger Tam restaurant. In 2013 she launched Bar Bolonat. Over the years she has become a familiar figure in New York, after appearing on shows on the Food Channel and writing a book.</p> \n<p>“At first I was embarrassed to be making falafel,” says the chef, who over the years has become a familiar figure on Manhattan's culinary landscape, after writing a cookbook and appearing on the Food Channel. “When I told people in Israel that I was making falafel in New York, no one was particularly impressed. It was more like, ‘You went all the way to New York just to sell falafel?’ And look, nowadays lots of chefs are moving from haute cuisine to fast food. So I started with fast food and moved to more sophisticated food.”</p> \n<p>When I first met her two years ago Admony said that he had a dream of taking Tam and turning it into a type of “Israeli Chipotle.” At that time she was already speaking to potential investors.</p> \n<p>“Stefan and I have been working like crazy and we can’t do anything more in the realm of operations,” she explained then. “The truth is you can’t make a lot of money in the restaurant business. We’re also thinking of how to pay for college for our two little kids.”</p> \n<p>Not all of Admony’s ventures have succeeded. Two years ago she opened a restaurant called Combina, a tapas bar that combined Spanish and Israeli food. Combina was in a great location in SoHo, on West Broadway, one of the more stylish and expensive streets in the neighborhood. At Combina Admony served, among other things a salty-fish donut. But the eatery failed.</p> \n<p>“The rent was sky-high,” she says now. “We wanted to cut our losses quickly before it affected the other businesses.”</p> \n<p>But Admony is unfazed. Even as she invests most of her efforts in falafel, she tells of a plan to open a couscous restaurant near the Hudson River in a few months. The restaurant will be called Kish-Kash, after the sieve used to prepare the traditional North African dish. Other local restaurants feature couscous, such as the veteran Caf&eacute; Mogador, but Admony is promising couscous like New Yorkers have never seen before.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Donald Trump brought the United States even closer to full-scale intervention in the Syrian conflict this week, with a direct threat of force against Syria’s President Bashar Assad’s regime. His move put the U.S. on a collision course with Russia. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>The American president’s aggressive posturing and military actions are taking many by surprise. He had campaigned on a vehement anti-war stance (except for when it came to bombing ISIS), had promised to work with Russia in Syria, and had been a fierce critic of any U.S. involvement in Syria during President Barack Obama’s administration.</p> \n<p>Trump’s first foray into Syria came on April 7, when he ordered a Tomahawk missile strike on a Syria’s Shayrat airfield in response to a sarin attack that killed more than 70 people, including civilians. Russia immediately condemned the attack. Trump however received high approval ratings in the U.S., since many Americans were moved by the horrific images (as was Trump) coming out of Syria after the chemical attack, which added to the near half-million dead in Syria’s devastating six-year civil war.</p> \n<p>Trump’s war</p> \n<p>Since the Tomahawk strike, tensions between the U.S., Russia and Assad continued to escalate. &nbsp;Then on June 19, a U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian army jet in the countryside near Raqqa. Washington said the Syrian jet had dropped bombs near U.S. backed forces.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Russia quickly declared that an “act of aggression” and threatened to shoot down any aircraft in its area of operation in Syria.</p> \n<p>The U.S. and Russia (and Israel) had previously been coordinating operations over Syria in an effort to avoid any potential clashes or accidental run-ins. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>A mere two days later, a U.S. F-15E fighter jet shot down an Iranian-made Shahed 129 pro-regime drone. The U.S. said the drone was armed and in firing range of U.S. troops. The downing of the drone marked the fifth time since late May the U.S. military has bombed pro-Syrian forces in southern Syria.</p> \n<p>These various escalations have led political observers both inside and outside the Beltway to dub the Syrian conflict: Trump’s War.</p> \n<p>‘No more stupid wars’</p> \n<p>Trump’s course change in Syria was a sudden one. As recently as March 30, the Trump administration had been saying the U.S. government has shifted position regarding Syria and would no longer push for Assad’s removal.</p> \n<p>But just five days later, on April 4, the Trump White House released a statement showing a change of heart: &quot;These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration’s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a ‘red line’ against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing.”</p> \n<p>MSNBC's Greta Van Susteren quickly called out the sudden U-turn. &quot;A few years ago, in the midst of the debate whether President Obama should use force in Syria, then Mr. Trump, now President Trump, had a different opinion,&quot; Susteren said on her April 4 show. &quot;In a tweet, then Mr. Trump said, quote, ‘President Obama, do not attack Syria.’ &quot;</p> \n<p>Trump himself explained the change on April 5: &quot;My attitude on Syria and Assad has changed very much, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, Trump has a long history of denouncing intervention in Syria to walk back. &quot;President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria!&quot; he tweeted September 1, 2013.</p> \n<p>On October 26, 2016, while campaigning against Hillary Clinton in the general election, Trump spoke at length about not intervening in Syria. &quot;What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,&quot; said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort, as Reuters reported.</p> \n<p>&quot;You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,” he blasted.</p> \n<p>&quot;You’re not fighting Syria any more, you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,&quot; he continued.</p> \n<p>A history of flip-flops</p> \n<p>Trump’s Syria reversal is not his first flip-flop when it comes to U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Check facting website Politifact deemed Trump’s &nbsp;September 2016 statement &quot;I was totally against the war in Iraq,” completely false.</p> \n<p>“While he came to that position when the war became difficult, earlier on he was more accepting of military action. In 2002, asked if America should go to war, he said, ‘I guess so,’” concluded the fact checkers.</p> \n<p>Trump tried to rewrite his support for the war in Iraq as he made non-interventionism a major part of his platform, taking a position that was often compared to that of hard-left presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. &quot;Going into Iraq, it may have been the worst decision anybody has made, any president has made, in the history of this country. That's how bad it is,&quot; Trump said on February 18, 2016.</p> \n<p>In fact, Trump has been consistent about something else: his position on Iran. His U-turn on Syria can be understood in the context of his animosity to Tehran (and love affair with Saudi Arabia). Reports coming out of the White House say Iran hawks in the Trump administration are pushing the president to escalate in Syria. According to the Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf, these hawks want to broaden the Syrian conflict in order to pit the U.S. against Iran, one of Assad’s major backers. Trump wants to do that anyway.</p>",

I will seek council with the coalition chair and with faction heads in order to make the necessary adjustments, in accordance with the prime minister's message.&quot;</p> \n<p>Amsalem stressed that the law will be promoted even if it won't impact the premier.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The prime minister's decision also coincides with&nbsp;the police interrogation of coalition whip David Bitan on Sunday on suspicion of bribery, money laundering, fraud and breach of trust during his time as deputy mayor of Rishon Letzion. Bitan has been a key player in efforts to get the legislation passed, which has been seen as intending to protect Netanyahu, who is currently the subject of two police investigations.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A guide for the perplexed: The many affairs involving Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;Amsalem, who is Bitan's Likud Knesset colleague, called the latter's questioning by police on Sunday an attempt to harm the efforts to pass the bill. &quot;What is happening here is a very serious matter,&quot; he said, and spoke of &quot;a huge army&quot; that includes the political system and the media, which he said have been trying &quot;bring Netanyahu down.&quot;</p> \n<p>Acknowledging the obligation of the police to pursue criminal investigation, he asked rhetorically what would happen if Bitan were sidelined by police questioning for two more days. &quot;Someone here is trying to scuttle the legislation,&quot; he declared.</p> \n<p>For her part, however, Israel Police spokeswoman Merav Lapidot, told Army Radio: &quot;The investigation began more than a year ago, before Bitan dreamed about the [police] recommendation bill. There is no connection between the two.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier on Sunday, Environmental Protection Minister Zeev Elkin asked that the final two rounds of voting on the &quot;recommendations law&quot; be delayed by a week. Elkin's request, which he voiced at a meeting of cabinet ministers from the ruling Likud party, came among growing concern over whether a majority can be mustered to pass the bill.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Knesset's Interior and Environment Committee began a marathon debate on Sunday about reservations reagarding the bill lodged by opposition Knesset members.</p> \n<p>Lawmaker Merav Ben Ari of Kulanu, a party in the government coalition, also raised her own concerns about the bill, saying that she would support it only if it doesn't take effect for another three months.</p> \n<p>The opposition party Meretz has a long list of reservations that are due to be raised at Sunday's session. The party wants to strip the bill of its original content and require the attorney general to ask the police for its recommendations on criminal investigations of public officials, and require the police to publicly release recommendations.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Behind the scenes of perhaps the most corrupt bill the Israeli parliament has known | Analysis&nbsp;&gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The opposition Zionist Union Knesset faction has also submitted a large number of recommendations. On Saturday, Zionist Union chairman Avi Gabbay called on the heads of the coalition parties to reconsider their support for the bill.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the provision in the bill that would punish police investigators or prosecutors who leak police recommendations that come into their possession is to be eliminated.</p> \n<p>The Knesset Interior Committee's legal counsel, Ido Ben-Yitzhak, told the committee members that the final version of the bill would not create such a new criminal offense, even though it appears in a version that the Knesset voted on in an initial vote.</p> \n<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked opposed the provision, in part because it would require the attorney general to open an investigation into the leaks rather than giving him discretion on the matter.</p> \n<p>The revised version makes it clear that a law already on the books barring the leak of information by a public servant will also apply to the leak of written police recommendations.</p> \n<p>Speaking in Washington at the Saban Forum on Middle East policy, Shaked said the Israeli public didn't elect the current right-wing government to pass such a law, but rather to carry out ideologically-based reforms.</p> \n<p>She said the energy invested in passing the bill may be misplaced, but&nbsp; added that if the personal issue (presumbably hinting at Netanyahu's involvement) is put aside, the bill is reasonable in protecting the rights of the accused over the public's right to know.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After more than a year of discussions, fears, promises and assessments – U.S. President Donald Trump delivered a landmark speech in Washington Wednesday, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.</p> \n<p>As expected, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the announcement, while Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared that the U.S. can no longer act as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. Israeli security forces are on alert for a possible escalation in Jerusalem and in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump just upended the entire history of Middle East diplomacy - and delivered Netanyahu's ultimate coup&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Prince Hassan of Jordan: Donald Trump's Jerusalem move plays politics with international law - and our lives | Opinion ■&nbsp;'Two-state solution is over,' top Palestinian diplomat says after Trump's Jerusalem speech&nbsp;| Opinion &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>Alongside the recognition, the speech included three central points: Trump refrained from explicitly stating that the two-state solution is the only path to a peace agreement, only saying &quot;the United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides,&quot; echoing comments he made in the past at a press conference alongside Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The president also announced that he has instructed the relevant teams to begin planning the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, yet did not state when such a move will take place.&nbsp; Finally, Trump stressed that American recognition of Jerusalem is not tantamount to a position on the issue of Israeli borders and sovereignty in Jerusalem. Those, he said, will be decided upon in negotiations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;It is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,&quot; Trump said at the start of his speech. &quot;This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done.&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump added however that &quot;we are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides.&quot;</p> \n<p>Trump called for to &quot;maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif.&quot; According to the president, &quot;with today's action, I reaffirm my administration's long standing commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. We are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace.&quot;</p> \n<p>Despite declaring that he has ordered the U.S. State Department to prepare for the relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem, Trump signed the waiver Wednesday delaying the move for six months. &quot;In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act urging the federal government to relocate the American Embassy to Jerusalem and to recognize that that city, and so importantly, is Israel's capital,&quot; Trump said. &quot;This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago.&quot; And yet, he added, &quot;after more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lauded Trump, calling it a &quot;historic day.&quot; Netanyahu said that any peace agreement with the Palestinians must include Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and added that there will be no change in the status of the city's holy sites.</p> \n<p>&quot;Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia,&quot; said the prime minister. &quot;Jerusalem has been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. It's so rare to be able to speak of new and genuine milestones in the glorious history of this city, yet today's pronouncement by President Trump is such an occasion,&quot; said Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>In exclusive comments to Haaretz, Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian peace negotiator responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p> \n<p>&quot;President Trump has delivered a message to the Palestinian people: the two-state solution is over. Now is the time to transform the struggle for one-state with equal rights for everyone living in historic Palestine, from the river to the sea.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier, Palestinian President&nbsp;Mahmoud Abbas&nbsp;rejected&nbsp;Trump's speech on Jerusalem, saying&nbsp;it encourages the occupation and construction of Israeli settlements. Abbas said&nbsp;that the move drives the U.S. further away from its role as a mediator and sponsor in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and undermines any attempt to achieve a two-state solution. He said Trump's decision violates international law and encourages the occupation and construction of Israeli settlements.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Muslims across the Middle East warned of disastrous consequences as a result of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p> \n<p>Israel's security services are on high alert Thursday morning, with possible scenarios including mass protests as well as rock and firebomb throwing in familiar flashpoints such as army checkpoints and on roads. Another danger is an escalation of &quot;lone-wolf&quot; attacks such as stabbings and assaults with improvised weapons.</p> \n<p>Trump's speech was met with mixed reactions in the U.S. Congress and by the Jewish community in the U.S. While members of the Republican Party overwhelmingly expressed support for the move, Democrats were split between those who congratulated Trump and those who called it a dangerous and irresponsible action.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Under the U.S. Constitution, the Senate has sole authority to confirm a president's nominee to serve in the Cabinet. And while President-elect Donald Trump can't officially nominate anyone until he becomes president on Jan. 20, the Senate is getting an early start this week on his choices for several top jobs in his administration.</p> \n<p>The action began Tuesday with Trump's pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a longtime senator from Alabama, and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, named by Trump to head the Department of Homeland Security.</p> \n<p>By holding hearings before Inauguration Day, the Senate can move quickly once Trump takes the oath of office and formally submits his Cabinet nominees for approval.</p> \n<p>Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate, meaning the hearings are unlikely to make or break nominations. Most, if not all, will go through.</p> \n<p>But the hearings offer senators an opportunity to explore the backgrounds of Trump's team and plans for the agencies they will soon lead. For Democrats, the hearings offer a high-profile stage to challenge Trump's proposals.</p> \n<p>Here's a look at all of Trump's picks:</p> \n<p>Secretary of State: Rex Tillerson</p> \n<p>Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to chairman and chief executive officer in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world's largest energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon's chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea.</p> \n<p>Treasury Secretary: Steven Mnuchin</p> \n<p>Mnuchin, 54, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California's largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners.</p> \n<p>Defense Secretary: James Mattis</p> \n<p>Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname &quot;Mad Dog.&quot; He was rebuked in 2005 for saying: &quot;It's fun to shoot some people.&quot;</p> \n<p>U.S. Attorney General: Jeff Sessions</p> \n<p>Sessions, 70, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump's presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the senator from Alabama and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.</p> \n<p>Interior Secretary: Ryan Zinke</p> \n<p>Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican representative from Montana and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring coal, which suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent.</p> \n<p>Commerce Secretary: Wilbur Ross</p> \n<p>Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross &amp; Co, and Forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign's views on trade policy. He blames massive U.S. factory job losses on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization. U.S.</p> \n<p>Trade Representative: Robert Lighthizer</p> \n<p>Lighthizer served as deputy U.S. trade representative during the Reagan administration in the 1980s and has since spent nearly three decades as a lawyer representing U.S. companies in anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, currently with the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. A harsh critic of China's trade practices, Lighthizer in 2010 told Congress that U.S. policymakers should take a more aggressive approach in dealing with the Asian country.</p> \n<p>Labor Secretary: Andrew Puzder</p> \n<p>Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc , which runs the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.</p> \n<p>Health and Human Services Secretary: Tom Price&nbsp;</p> \n<p>U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion.</p> \n<p>Housing and Urban Development Secretary: Ben Carson</p> \n<p>Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson had been reluctant to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. He is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump.</p> \n<p>Transportation Secretary: Elaine Chao</p> \n<p>Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand Plc , News Corp and Vulcan Materials Co. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky.</p> \n<p>Energy Secretary: Rick Perry</p> \n<p>Perry, 66, adds to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump's Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination and briefly ran for president in 2016, would be responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversee the nation's nuclear weapons program.</p> \n<p>Education Secretary: Betsy Devos</p> \n<p>DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for expansion of charter schools.</p> \n<p>Department Of Homeland Security Secretary: John Kelly</p> \n<p>The final leadership role of Kelly's 45-year military career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Democratic President Barack Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States' southern border with Mexico.</p> \n<p>White House Chief Of Staff: Reince Priebus</p> \n<p>Priebus recently was re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman but will give up the job to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump's agenda. Priebus, 44, was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice.</p> \n<p>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator: Scott Pruitt</p> \n<p>An ardent opponent of Obama's measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-elect's promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011 and has challenged the EPA multiple times since.</p> \n<p>Office of Management and Budget: Mick Mulvaney</p> \n<p>U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. U.S.</p> \n<p>Ambassador To The United Nations: Nikki Haley</p> \n<p>Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman.</p> \n<p>Small Business Administration Administrator: Linda Mcmahon</p> \n<p>McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign.</p> \n<p>CIA Director: Mike Pompeo</p> \n<p>U.S. Representative Pompeo, 53, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government's sweeping collection of Americans' communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.</p> \n<p>National Security Adviser: Michael Flynn</p> \n<p>Retired Lieutenant General Flynn was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama's foreign policy.</p> \n<p>White House Homeland Security Adviser</p> \n<p>Tom Bossert, 41, who worked as deputy homeland security adviser to former Republican President George W. Bush, will serve as the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. He currently runs a risk management consulting firm and has a cyber risk fellowship with the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington.</p> \n<p>National Economic Council Director: Gary Cohn</p> \n<p>Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a &quot;global power structure&quot; that had robbed America's working class.</p> \n<p>National Trade Council Director: Peter Navarro</p> \n<p>Navarro, 67, has suggested a stepped-up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with a submarine development program. A professor at University of California, Irvine, who advised Trump during the campaign, Navarro argued that Washington should stop referring to the &quot;one China&quot; policy, but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize Taipei: &quot;There is no need to unnecessarily poke the Panda.&quot;</p> \n<p>Secretary Of The Army: Vincent Viola</p> \n<p>Viola, 60, is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point graduate and a U.S. Army veteran who served in the famed 101st Airborne Division. He founded high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc and served as chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career. After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. He is an owner of the Florida Panthers ice hockey team.</p> \n<p>Chief White House Strategist, Senior Counselor: Steve Bannon</p> \n<p>The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump's campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump's dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump's gatekeeper and agenda-setter.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>For a long time the left, even the sane left, has been abandoning the arena of nationhood to the right. The results can be seen all around us, in the strengthening of the far right throughout the democratic world – from the United States to Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And in Israel too.</p> \n<p>For a long time this left has been explaining its democratic, social-democratic and liberal values in terms of opposition to nationhood. In doing so it has created a misleading contradiction between liberty on the one hand and nationhood on the other. It has condemned any national aspiration and seen it as the development of fascism, and labeled anyone who wanted to protect his national identity as a racist.</p> \n<p>But the contrast created by the left between liberty and human rights on the one hand, and nationhood on the other, is boomeranging against them. It is emptying the center of the map of its democratic content: Because democracy is not only liberty limited to the private sphere; its an expression of the basic political right for which oppressed nations are fighting: the right to self determination. The democratic nation-state is incredibly precious. It enables people to be themselves.</p> \n<p>And themselves doesnt mean turning the self into a Nietzschean project of self-creation, in a version that the spoiled elites of identity politics dream about. This concept is suitable for those whose existential security is taken for granted and who can imagine themselves (with a degree of superficiality) as though mobility itself is their home, and airport VIP lounges, or international conferences, are sufficient to meet their needs for identity. It is certainly not a substitute for national independence, which is the most effective framework enabling people to be themselves.</p> \n<p>There is no need to mention the dangers involved in ultra-nationalism after the horrors of the 20th century. But nor should we forget the nationalist nature of democracy, and the fact that it is the most stable expression known to us of the right to self determination. Democracy channels cultural identity into the public sphere and enables it to fulfill itself.</p> \n<p>The attempts to transcend nationhood undermine this basic right, but not it alone. They directly undermine the heart of democracy: government by the consent of the governed. It is not difficult to notice that international institutions which transcended nationhood at the same time transcended democracy as well; in other words, they transcended the ability of human beings to control their fate. From the European Union, to the World Bank, to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, such institutions have a dramatic influence on the lives of citizens who are unable to influence their policy the way they can wield influence in the context of a democratic nation-state.</p> \n<p>An accelerating division of the political map between anti-liberal nationhood and anti-national liberalism is pulling the rug out from under what consolidates and unites democracies. Because the prestigious club of abstract, supranational liberalism is inaccessible to people whose lives are more rooted in time and place, the result of all that is directing the democratic urge rightward towards the ultranationalist wing.</p> \n<p>If the liberal elites continue to condemn the right of self-determination and so see it as an expression of racism, only the racists will remain to defend it. That will enable the far right to become stronger in Europe and the United States. And the same thing could happen in Israel too.</p> \n<p>David Frum remarked recently in The Atlantic magazine that When liberals insist that only fascists will defend borders, then voters will hire fascists to do the job liberals wont do. And what is true of borders is also true of identity. If the left-liberal elite continues to mock peoples desire to preserve their cultural identity, the democratic urge for self-determination will also be channeled to the far right, at the expense of the center and the left. Anyone who scorns nationhood and presents it as racism will get racist nationhood in the elections.</p>",

The wounded were taken for medical care in Israel, opening up the secret channel.</p> \n<p>Fusan al-Joulan is said to have some 400 fighters and maintains loose alliances with four other groups on the Syrian side of the border with Israel, all of whom reportedly receive some amount of aid from Israel. Unlike Fursan al-Joulan, some of the groups benefit from Western backing and are affiliated in some capacity with the Free Syrian Army, according to the report.</p> \n<p>While Israel's medical assistance to wounded Syrians who arrive at the border has been public knowledge since the beginning of the civil war, the new information detailing the depth of Israeli support for the rebels could further escalate tensions with the Syrian government and President Bashar Assad's forces, with whom Israel has technically been in a state of war with for decades. Israeli airstrikes have targeted forces in Syria on multiple occasions, mainly taking aim at weapons shipments en route to Lebanon's Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>One source confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that money does cross the border into Syria but that it is used for humanitarian purposes. Rebel fighters contradicted this claim, saying the funds were used to pay salaries and buy munitions.</p> \n<p>The Wall Street Journal said the Israeli army wouldn't comment on the rebels' claims, but said Israel is &quot;committed to securing the borders of Israel and preventing the establishment of terror cells and hostile forces ... in addition to providing humanitarian aid to the Syrians living in the area.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>An Israeli company's software has been used to infiltrate mobile devices held by human rights lawyers, journalists and activists fighting government corruption in Mexico, according to a report published in the New York Times on Monday.</p> \n<p>The highly-advanced software, known as Pegasus, is only sold to governments by the Israeli firm NSO Group on condition that the cyber technology be used in anti-terror or anti-criminal intelligence efforts. The company is known for its cyber expertise and according to the report, &quot;charges $650,000 on top of a flat $500,000 installation fee,&quot; to spy on 10 iPhone holders. The NSO Group has also run operations under different names like OSY Technologies, which paid former U.S. national security adviser Michal Flynn over $40,000 as an advisory board member for nearly a year, until last January.</p> \n<p>According to the New York Times, &quot;at least three Mexican federal agencies have purchased about $80 million worth of spyware&quot; from the Israeli company, and has used it to fully monitor and control mobile activity, including calls, texts, emails, contacts, calendars, microphones and cameras, against civilians critical of the government, most likely without the proper legal permits from a federal judge.</p> \n<p>&quot;Mexican security agencies wouldn't ask for a court order because they know they wouldn't get one,&quot; Eduardo Guerrero, formerly an analyst in Mexico's intelligence agency, told the New York Times. &quot;There, of course, is no basis for that intervention, but that is beside the point. No one in Mexico ever asks permission to do so.&quot;</p> \n<p>The report detailed the stories of two of Mexico's most widely-known journalists, a prominent academic figure drafting anti-corruption legislation and others formerly or currently involved in activities critical of government actions or policies, who cyber experts identified as having been targeted by the malicious software by way of false links and highly-personalized text messages meant to entice the targets to click, and unwittingly allow Pegasus free flight through their devices.</p> \n<p>The Mexican government told the New York Times it &quot;categorically denies that any of its members engages in surveillance or communications operations against defenders of human rights, journalists, anti-corruption activists or any other person with prior judicial authorization,&quot; but it's considered highly unlikely by the NSO Group that anyone outside the government could make use of the technology. The New York Times report also briefly suggested the possibility that a rogue entity within the government was able to utilize the software.</p> \n<p>While odds suggest that sources from within the government must be responsible for the hacks, the report noted that there was no direct proof to this effect, and that the NSO Group itself has little control over governments' use of the technology after a sale is complete.</p> \n<p>&quot;When you're selling AK-47s, you can't control how they'll be used once the leave the loading docks,&quot; the report quoted a mobile security expert as saying.</p> \n<p>The NSO Group absolves itself from responsibility, saying it takes governments' human rights records into careful consideration before selling them the software. According to the report, after completing a sale, &quot;the company's only recourse is to slowly cut off a government's access to the spy tools over the course of months, or even years, by ceasing to provide new software patches, features and updates. But in the case of Mexico, the NSO Group has not condemned or even acknowledged any abuse, despite repeated evidence that its spy tools have been deployed against ordinary citizens and their families.&quot;</p> \n<p>The revelations in Mexico however, aren't the first time the NSO Group has been identified as the source of malicious software used to spy on human rights activists and other civilians, most likely by their governmental clients. In August, 2016, researchers in the U.S. claimed that the firm's technology was used against a political dissident in the United Arab Emirates, a journalist in Mexico and a minority party politician in Kenya.</p> \n<p>At the time, the software was the first-known technology that was capable of remotely taking over a fully up-to-date iPhone 6. Apple issued a patch to fix the vulnerability exploited by that version of Pegasus.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nearly every Israeli is familiar with the Waze application, which has changed the way we all drive. But the Waze brand only really has a presence in Israel; elsewhere in the world, it has been swallowed up in the company that bought it for $1.1 billion in 2013: Google. Some 70% of all traffic information on the Google Maps app – the largest of its kind globally, of course – is based on Waze technology. So the Waze revolution is changing traffic throughout the world, though mostly under a different name.</p> \n<p>The success of the Israeli startup is something others are seeking to emulate. And Waze isn’t the only local success story when it comes to transportation. Mobileye, which manufactures safety systems that identify when a vehicle veers from its lane or is getting too close to vehicles or pedestrians, is valued at more than $7.5 billion – despite a rift that has developed between the company and U.S. automaker Tesla, the world’s most prominent developer of driverless cars.</p> \n<p>Public transportation app Moovit has amassed 50 million users in 1,200 cities worldwide; these numbers attracted the attention of some of the world’s biggest automakers, and BMW is now an investor in the Nes Tziona-based company. Then there’s the taxi-ordering app Gett (previously known as GetTaxi), which nabbed a $300-million investment from Volkswagen last May.</p> \n<p>One of the lesser-known Israeli startups in the field is Hod Hasharon-based Valens, which developed a chip for transferring and processing large quantities of data at high speed in the smart car, and is collaborating with German automaker Daimler. In addition, General Motors has operated an R&amp;D plant in Israel since 2008, and now employs 250 researchers. Daimler is currently opening its own research center here, while Renault is mulling a similar move.</p> \n<p>All of these examples, and more, are cited in a comprehensive report prepared by German strategic consulting firm Roland Berger, which was just submitted to the Alternative Fuels Administration in the Prime Minister’s Office. The report’s title, “Israel’s Automotive &amp; Smart Mobility Industry,” belies the ambition behind it: In the coming weeks, the government will be presented with a National Plan for the Development of Smart Transportation, which in the first stage will include the formation of a team headed by PMO Director General Eli Groner and Transportation and Road Safety Ministry Director General Keren Turner and tasked with formulating policy that will turn Israel into a smart transportation superpower.</p> \n<p>Fashionably late</p> \n<p>The team will try to determine the application mechanisms needed to advance the smart transportation plan, whose guidelines have been set down by the Alternative Fuels Administration.</p> \n<p>The plan has six key points: allocating physical territory for transportation experimentation; making all government transportation databases accessible to those who wish to develop technological solutions; promoting cooperation between the industry and academia – essentially, creating an Israeli MIT that will bring together departments like geography, engineering, architecture, urban planning with the Office of the Chief Scientist to advance technological ideas in the field of transportation; changing the regulation to make it possible to conduct experiments and development in Israel i.e., for driving without two hands on the wheel; support for new developments and pilot programs; and comprehensive mapping of every road, parking lot, intersection and set of traffic lights in Israel. The plan will evidently call for the abovementioned 250-million-shekel investment initially.</p> \n<p>To a large degree, the government was forced to come out with its smart transportation plan after the local high-tech industry made such a splash in the field. But the government’s fashionably late entrance into the game is not a cause for concern. According to the data from Roland Berger, smart transportation is a “disruptive technology” – an industry that creates new markets with its innovative technologies. There is no question that smart transportation technology is going to fundamentally change the business model of every automaker, every public transportation operator and every transportation ministry worldwide.</p> \n<p>Wanted: Unconventional thinking</p> \n<p>By 2030, income in the field is forecasted to reach between $7.8 trillion to $9.4 trillion, with profits totaling $57.5 billion. This is a huge opportunity because of the tremendous magnitude involved, and because this is disruptive technology. The startup nation on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean has a clear relative advantage when it comes to disruptive technologies that require thinking outside the box.</p> \n<p>This sort of thought process covers ideas like traffic lights that change depending on the state of the traffic; buses that skip stops based on the number of people waiting at each one; buses that pick up people from their homes on order; cars that communicate with each other for safety or traffic management purposes; parking garages where the car parks itself; cars that brake independently in order to avoid an accident; and even – though not before 2030, it would seem – a transition to driverless cars.</p> \n<p>The world of autonomous vehicles will also be a world of only electric cars, with batteries that charge in mere seconds, and advance payment and ordering systems that will let people order a ride or share a trip for maximum convenience. Forecasting of traffic pressures and passenger loads will be a key part of these advanced transportation systems, as will the development of alternative energy sources.</p> \n<p>Traditional automakers are going to be hit by this technological shift. They will see the concept of the car losing its prestige and their brand losing its importance. In the age of the driverless vehicle, many fewer cars will be produced since they will have a much longer lifespan; and fierce price competition can be expected among manufacturers. Ridesharing, currently perceived as a forward-looking industry, could also take a hit in the absence of private cars in which to share rides.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, countries at the forefront of this technological development and who adapt their transportation systems to the required technologies could reap vast benefits.</p> \n<p>The Roland Berger report says Israel is at an optimal starting point to profit from the change. It has no automakers that stand to be hurt. At the same time, it is a technology leader in electro-optics, big data and forecasting, and also a leader in the transition to electric vehicles. Israel already has more than 500 startups working in the field. In all, there are about 2,000 entrepreneurs and some 200 research studies focused on areas connected with smart transportation.</p> \n<p>Startups need the government</p> \n<p>The early success of companies like Waze, Mobileye, GetTaxi and Moovit has stoked excitement and whet the appetite for more of the same. But unlike other fields of technology, in the smart transportation field startups need government assistance – or mainly an assurance that the government won’t get in their way.</p> \n<p>Regulation is needed to enable experiments in various types of transportation, to allocate areas for experimentation and make government data on transportation accessible.</p> \n<p>Such access would include, for example, making the database of Rav-Kav card users available for public use, including information about where each rider gets on and off a bus, to enable the construction of forecasting models for passenger traffic. It would also include online mapping of all the roads in Israel – down to the level of cracks in the road, which the self-driving car needs to know about in real time. All of this is necessary for the smart transportation revolution to really take off, as is funding from the Israel Innovation Authority to encourage the development of relevant technologies.</p> \n<p>To ensure that Israel doesn’t miss out on this massive opportunity, the special team was established to consider how best to implement the smart transportation plan. The fact that the team is situated in the Prime Minister’s Office, under the director of the PMO and with the support of the National Economic Council, shows how much importance the matter has been given.</p> \n<p>One can only hope that all the good intentions won’t be squandered by the questionable ability of the government to implement them.</p>",

Once Senator Durbin anonymously objected, the legislation was delayed for an indefinite period of time.”  “While holding up a copy of Tuesday’s New York Times article describing Israel’s decision to expand settlement building, Udall blasted the current Senate legislation. “The issue is Senate Resolution 6 completely ignores the settlement issue I think the settlements have to be part of the issue if you are passing a resolution,” he said “I presented an amendment during the committee.

The U.S. Ambassador has had an apartment in Jerusalem since 1995. So the notion that somehow having an apartment in Jerusalem is moving the embassy to Jerusalem is a fiction that I don’t think anybody is going to accept.”  Petraeus:&nbsp;“I was actually reassured by the caution on the embassy issue after last week we heard it’s going to happen. By the way, I am not sure they can hold this off forever the way previous administrations have just basically forgotten about it when nobody was pushing them to do it. This is a campaign promise. This is an individual who has said he’s going to be different, that what he has said he will actually do, unlike all these others He was a disrupter as a candidate, and now he is the disrupter-in-chief the Oval Office, and so I think it’s possible something may be done. I was reassured to see a degree of caution on this emerge, and that, I think, is positive, although I don’t think it’s something that he can just forget.” &nbsp;  Walter Russell Mead:&nbsp;“It's very important from an Israeli perspective that Israel not let itself get identified with President Trump in the minds of American political people of both parties. Remember that he did not win the popular vote, he took office with the lowest poll ratings of any president in modern history. It would be a tremendous mistake to make it look like this is Israel’s man, this is our hope. On the other hand, he might be tremendously successful. We just don’t know.” &nbsp;  KAFE KNESSET -- by Tal Shalev:&nbsp;The Knesset was packed&nbsp;today for PM Netanyahu's parliamentary Q&amp;A session. The session began with Netanyahu, aided by debate rule bending from Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, dodging all questions about the various investigations he faces. The Bibi show at the Knesset Plenum is planned for almost two hours, and is likely to produce even more highlights as the day goes on...  Wrapping up the INSS policy conference last night, Israeli Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked discussed the possible move of the US embassy to Jerusalem. Shaked pledged&nbsp;government assistance to any country that moves their embassy, revealing that Interior Minister Aryeh Deri has proposed an exemption from local council property taxes for those that make the move.&nbsp;&quot;Changing the embassy's location would be the best evidence of a change in the American approach,&quot;&nbsp;Shaked said, appealing to the rest of the world to follow suit. &quot;I allow myself to leak something that the Israeli Cabinet approved. Minister Deri stated that every country that moves their embassy will receive an exemption in property taxes.”  ON THE HILL: “Nikki Haley confirmed as new U.S. envoy to the United Nations” by Anne Gearan:&nbsp;“[Nikki] Haley, who has no formal diplomatic experience, won significant Democratic support. The vote of 96-4 reflected some Democrats’ view that Haley would be a sensible diplomat and speak her mind in the new administration She said she... would reassert the traditional role of the United States in recent decades of protecting Israel from United Nations action it considers biased. She also declared her support for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.”&nbsp;[WashPost]  &quot;Trump team narrowing search for State Department’s No. 2 official&quot; by Josh Rogin:&nbsp;&quot;Two leading contenders for the job now are former White House and State Department official&nbsp;Elliott Abrams&nbsp;and former State Department official&nbsp;Paula Dobriansky.&nbsp;The Trump administration has decided not to appoint a deputy secretary of state for management, a post created by the Obama administration in 2009. This means the sole remaining deputy secretary will have enormous influence over both policy and management issues in Foggy Bottom. Both Abrams and Dobriansky have diplomatic backgrounds and experience working in the often thorny State Department bureaucracy.&quot;&nbsp;[WashPost]  Trump Team Aims to Test Russia's Alliance With Iran” by Eli Lake:&nbsp;“Trump administration officials tell me that they will explore the extent to which Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to end this relationship and cooperate with U.S. policy to counter Iranian aggression in Syria and the Middle East. &quot;It's important to find out what are the limits of Russia's willingness to cooperate with us with regard to Iran,&quot; said Michael Ledeen, who during the transition served as an adviser to Michael Flynn, now Trump's national security adviser Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia who was an architect of Obama's first-term outreach to Russia, told me he didn't know what Trump could offer Putin in exchange for abandoning Iran, a key ally and trading partner.”&nbsp;[Bloomberg] &nbsp;</p> \n<p>** Good Wednesday Morning!

        "text":["<p>When monarch butterflies migrate, the world watches in wonder. Migrating birds also awe us, not least when we consider the vast distances they travel with their little wings. The migration of insects in general leaves us clammier. Yet, like many birds and four-legged animals, many insects migrate with the seasons, and the extent of invertebrate migration had never been measured until now, let alone its environmental impact. With climate change upon us, the time had come to look.</p> \n<p>An international team of scientists, working in the air space over 70,000 square kilometers of southern England for 10 years, discovered that relocating insects are the biggest movement of biomass on the planet. The diminutive winged creatures in question include ladybugs, aphids, locusts and butterflies.</p> \n<p>About 3,200 tons of insects migrate over southern England each year on their way to Africa, report the scientists, including Dr. Nir Sapir from the University of Haifa. This is eight times more than the combined weights of all birds and bats migrating over the region annually, they estimate in an article entitled “Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants,” in the December issue of Science.</p> \n<p>Put otherwise, 3,200 tons of bugs is equivalent to 10 Boeing 777s.</p> \n<p>How many bugs is 3,200 tons? About 3.4 trillion, give or take a few million. And of these masses, some 70 percent migrate during the daytime and the rest are nocturnal, the researchers observe.</p> \n<p>Apropos monarchs, about 150 million of them, weighing an aggregate 75 tons, fly between North America and Mexico each year.</p> \n<p>Radars for high-fliers</p> \n<p>People tend not to notice migrating insects, partly because many fly at high altitudes. The team studied insects migrating at heights of between 150 to 2,000 meters, using specialized radar techniques: Insects, they explain, are too small to carry transmitters or to be observed by any other means. Netting also proves helpful.</p> \n<p>Impact there must be. Massive amounts of nutrients locked in those tiny little bodies are moving between continents. Also, insects are a crucial part of human endeavor, ranging from farming to lipstick manufacture. Change in their patterns portends change in the way we live.</p> \n<p>However, what the enormous movement of insects through the planet’s skies means for ecology has yet to be elucidated. Since springtime movement north and autumn movement south roughly cancel each other out, over the long run, there should be no net ecological effect from that perspective. But the fluctuations can be vast, as much as 200 tons of insects in either direction in any given year, and this should affect annual exchanges of energy and nutrients.</p> \n<p>On a final intriguing note, the scientists proposed that larger insects have in-built compasses. “If high-flying insects have a compass sense, one would predict that, in addition to selecting a favorable tailwind, they would also orientate in the seasonally beneficial direction and, thus, actively contribute to their wind-assisted displacement,” according to the team – which indeed witnessed that phenomenon.</p> \n<p>Though the paper doesn’t dwell on the point, an urgent reason to evaluate the ecological impact of migrating insects is climate change. Global warming has already been playing havoc with the movement of larger animal populations, augmented by species permanently relocating. It is thus vital now to gain a better understanding of the environmental impact of insect migration, and how changes in it will affect us all.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Its capacity as a bypass route in the realm of art accords the Minus 1 gallery in Tel Aviv enhanced importance and distinctiveness. For its first solo exhibition from the Haaretz Collection of contemporary Israeli artworks, the gallery wisely chose the oeuvre of a largely unknown artist, Ayelet Zohar, who has not breached the barrier of galleries and museums. The exhibition reflects the personal taste of the collector (Amos Schocken) and the curator (Efrat Livny). By showing the work of an artist not recognized by the established institutions, they are broadening the narrow horizons of collective taste somewhat, challenging the domineering mass.</p> \n<p>One’s memory of the experience of Zohar’s exhibition focuses largely on a repetitive attempt at healing and wounding – in that order – expressed through two “military” actions, camouflage and shooting, which are partially converted into the field of art and at the same time flow outward from it. Another equally substantial experience is imparted by Zohar’s profound and protracted personal acquaintance with the cultures of Japan and China and with their traditional and modern art. She is thus able to make a connection between the aesthetics, language and core of the Far Eastern arts and a certain local Israeli aesthetic of arte povera, roughness and an improvisatory quality, a “lack of culture.” This welding informs the deep essence of Zohar’s work. Her soldering line goes on to fuse personal and public, transmuting elements of destruction into components of creation.</p> \n<p>The exhibition begins with “User Transparent” (1993-2001), which epitomizes the show’s soul (and is also its title). In this work, the intimate space of the bathtub becomes a kind of monument of power that betokens the engineering of its elements, while at the same time opening into the orbit of art, rife with tension between the decorative and the destructive. Pieces of a broken decorated dish tumble from above across a geometrically tiled Islamic ornament into the basin of the tub, next to which a tallit or flag-like towel hangs – a particular towel and a symbol of towels spanning human civilization. Above, in the center, Zohar has carved the words “User Transparent” (in Hebrew) in mirror script; the viewer is the mirror that deciphers the code, collaborating with the work against his will. An additional disruption is a trail of negative circles that lodge themselves in the painting, arbitrary but not coerced. And the ultimate intervention: the artist fires live bullets into the body of the work. The bullet holes puncture the bathtub, the tiles, the fringe of the towel, the ceramic fragments, the uniformly green background. The shooting, repeated time and again in other works, disturbs their relative tranquility, like fate itself. And it’s important to emphasize that the target practice takes place in the finished work: damage and destruction as an integral element of the act of creation. “Snipers and Butterflies” accurately reflects its title. It’s a large screen printing on wallpaper of repeated and continuing motifs: singing birds and nesting birds, leaves and acorns, dragonflies, butterflies and bees upon a gentle grid of branches. Only a second gaze reveals the snipers, in camouflage, kneeling to fire in the cultivated lap of nature.</p> \n<p>Pure poetry</p> \n<p>Indeed, the exhibition is studded with exquisite works from an extended series of camouflage patterns. These are done in black ink on pages from a calligraphy training notebook, a kind of gentle geometric grid of rationality on which the artist’s imagination is given free rein, while at the same time an element of repetition reins in the imagination. In each case, from this conflict, Zohar has created a different pattern of camouflage that is an imitation of the thing itself, but also extends into the Japanese and Chinese space, in the ancient tradition of calligraphic drawing in which a few light brush strokes capture a whole world. Their richness is pure poetry.</p> \n<p>A contradistinction to these works is provided by elongated panoramic paintings from Zohar’s “Marun al-Ras” series. Displayed in a separate space, these are works of ink, acrylic and oil on plywood (apart from one on canvas), a rendering of night landscapes from the Galilee Panhandle that blend the realistic with the near-fantastic. Emerging from this fusion are elements of a nightmarish dream, the reality of this beautiful landscape. A touch of the naive in the mode of painting deepens the inner tension of night’s beauty on the mountainous border. In “La La Land,” another work from this series, the mountain cliff is rendered in ink, like a calligraphic drawing, while the rest of the painting is Western in its density. Lights crawl along the ridgeline beneath dappled skies, cypresses thrust upward in the valley, here’s the Tel Hai lion, white plastic chairs on the grass, security searchlights, high-tension electricity columns, a cluster of warning sirens, and betwixt and between hangs a neon sign as though from a different reality.</p> \n<p>The visitor is led to the last wall, to “All That Remains / Organs without Body,” a painting and print executed on the gallery’s plaster wall itself. At first glance, this colorful wallpaper-like work is a celebration of imprinted and painted body organs and of lipstick kisses. But then we notice the shadows of warplanes and, between them, the names of vanished Palestinian villages written in pencil in calligraphic script. A box of mounted butterflies hangs on this wall, along with a video screen projecting an unbroken, hypnotic, disturbing loop of slanting eyes that seem to be trying to break out of the screen and understand what’s going on here, to grasp the madness, tragedy and splendor of this place.</p> \n<p>Nearby, Zohar’s vision materializes on a vast scale, not far from the Minus 1 gallery, as part of an exhibition titled “Post-Colonialism?” curated by Wendy Gers in the Benyamini Contemporary Ceramics Center. There, Zohar has wrapped the entire building in camouflage nets. Unlike the elegant decorum of Christo’s covering of monuments, Zohar’s version stirs fear and horror. It’s as though the building has been abducted from its natural surroundings by a violent force and transformed into the chrysalis of a secret conspiracy.</p> \n<p>The urban texture of this area of workshops, sprinkled with graffiti and with a row of national flags flying in front of the gallery building, also undergoes alienation. But at the same time, these elements forge a connection with the psychic texture and consciousness of this place – the arbitrariness of the security situation. Camouflage, erasure, blindness. Only close-up does this second skin become a living, breathing epidermis through which a cold east wind blows. And from even closer-up it becomes a calligraphic brush stroke on the whiteness of the walls, calligraphy in constant motion.</p> \n<p>Minus 1 gallery, 18 Schocken St., Tel Aviv, (03) 512-1732; Fri. 11:00-14:00; by appt. minus1@haaretz.co.il</p>",

        "text":["<p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi’s decision Thursday to postpone a vote on its Security Council resolution left the Palestinian delegation to the United Nation devastated, a senior Palestinian official in touch with the representatives in Ramallah told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>More than anyone else in Palestinian politics, the delegation in New York expected the United States to abstain on the resolution, rather than veto it, which would have been another point for Palestinian diplomacy. As usual, great expectations caused greater disappointment.</p> \n<p>Last year, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Foreign Ministry repeated their intention to submit a Security Council resolution (through the Arab League and Egypt) declaring settlement construction illegal. They waited for the right time – and hoped that just before leaving the White House, U.S. President Barak Obama would compensate for his powerlessness during his eight-year tenure.</p> \n<p>Once, they fantasized that he would recognize Palestine as a non-UN-member country. Later, they hoped that at least he would not veto the resolution, which theoretically is in line with the official American position.</p> \n<p>No one expected immediate concrete repercussions from the vote. Israel would not stop building in the settlements, and the UN and its members would not levy sanctions. Its significance could only have been symbolic – bringing the Palestinian issue in from the outer margins for just a few days and a rhetorical repetition of the position that the settlements violate international law. During a period when the president-elect appoints a man who financially supports the settlements as ambassador, symbolism has a defiant element.</p> \n<p>The Egyptian proposal was important to Palestinians, because of serious tension between Egypt and Abbas over the latter’s feud with Palestinian leader Mohammed Dahlan, who sees himself as a potential successor to the president. Abbas has suggested that he sees the attempt of Egypt and other Arab states to reconcile them as illegitimate interference. The Egyptian resolution signals that there are principles that rise above personal fights. Israel’s success in pressuring Sissi reinforces Palestinian despair and reinforces its sense of isolation.</p> \n<p>Palestinians active in the field of international law were encouraged Thursday by Israel’s nervousness over the Egyptian resolution, believing that it stemmed from the potential influence of the vote in the International Criminal Court in the Hague, which is still examining the request by the Palestinian Authority that it investigate whether Israel committed – and is committing – war crimes by the very establishment of settlements and the continued construction in them.</p> \n<p>The court’s delay is instructive about the pressures being exerted on it or the concerns of the judges about entering into a full-frontal confrontation with Israel, especially in the Donald Trump era.</p> \n<p>A South American diplomat said he believed that with the revent announcements by South Africa and Burundi that they intend withdrawing from the court, with other African countries expected to follow, it is possible the court will feel that it also has to judge “Ashkenazim,” as he put it – to dispel claims that it focuses only on Africa, the historic underdog.</p> \n<p>The influence of the vote would rise in concert with the number of countries supporting it and their importance.</p> \n<p>Diplomatic success – however insubstantial – would make it easier for Abbas and his associates internally. Some people believe that was the purpose of the resolution from the start – to show that the leadership is not as helpless as it looks: failing to prevent the killing of young Palestinians, and only able to verbally condemn settlement building and home demolitions by Israel.</p> \n<p>Israeli soldiers killed Ahamad al Harubi of al-Bireh early Thursday morning. He was among a group of youths who confronted soldiers when they came to demolish a room in the home of Masabah Abu Sabih – a Kafr Aqab resident with Jerusalem residency status – who murdered Livna Malihi and Yosi Kirma two months ago, before being shot and killed. According to an Israeli report, Al-Harubi threw an explosive at the force. According to a Palestinian report, he threw stones at soldiers.</p> \n<p>The raging youths who participated in his funeral looked and sounded like typical Fatah supporters, but very few Fatah flags were seen at the funeral.</p> \n<p>Al-Harubi was preceded by Ahmad al-Rimawi, also 19, who was killed when he and other youths clashed with an army force that infiltrated their village of Beit Rima last week. At his funeral and in the homes of the mourners, or next to the homes that were demolished, complaints were whispered about the absence of the leadership as a force that can protect its people.</p> \n<p>The humiliating postponement of the Security Council vote is yet further testimony to the weakness of Fatah and its leader. For the first time since 2007, the Palestinian legislative council met in Gaza on Wednesday, with the participation of not only Hamas representatives but also five Fatah members identified with Dahlan. (Since Hamas took over the security agencies in Gaza, Abbas has prevented the convening of the council, and it meets only in Gaza and passes laws valid only in Gaza.)</p> \n<p>The participants declared Abbas’ decision two weeks ago to lift the parliamentary immunity of five Fatah members (among them Dahlan) as illegal and unconstitutional. The Hamas authorities allowed Dahlan supporters to protest outside the council and to express their opposition to Abbas. Thus, Hamas joined with the Fatah rejects in presenting Abbas as a tyrant who makes decisions by himself and for the sake of himself and his cronies, while they rely on their collective status as publicly elected representatives and protectors of the basic law.</p> \n<p>The vote that was supposed to take place Thursday in the Security Council was presented as yet another step in a planned and supervised diplomatic track (which Abbas, during the recent Fatah conference, humorously called “diplomatic terror,” while aiming at the voices of the Israeli right that see any Palestinian step as a type of illegitimate warfare). Diplomatic success is very important to him – precisely because he opposes every other means of popular struggle.</p> \n<p>Abbas and his close associates expect international compensation for their position, the internal suppression and the security coordination with Israel, which helps it. They expect compensation not only in the form of donations that partially compensate for the economic damage that the Israeli occupation causes, but also in tangible political steps. By delaying the vote, Sissi signaled them that he is not worried; that he knows that they will continue to toe the line, with or without compensation.</p>",

The votes were delayed until after the Iranian Presidential elections so not to appear as American intruding in Tehran’s domestic affairs.

It would have been a great time to announce that the U.S. Embassy is moving to Jerusalem, the true capital of Israel,” [Mike] Huckabee said on Fox News. “I think it’s a missed opportunity,” he said. “I think it’s the right thing to do, [and] it’s the right time to do it.” [WashTimes]  SIGHTING:&nbsp;Mike Huckabee performing with his guitar in&nbsp;Jerusalem [YouTube] h/t Yehuda Joel Friedman and Jeff Ballabon  TRUMP TRIP POSTGAME: “How Trump stayed out of trouble in the Middle East” by Annie Karni:&nbsp;“A decision was made early on... to pack his schedule so that he mostly stayed on message and, according to one aide, “didn’t have time to tweet.” But a key factor was the role played by Dina Powell, H.R.

Jason Greenblatt is expected to return to the region on Thursday. Plus, before departing, Jared Kushner met for a side meeting with opposition leader, Isaac Herzog, and told him that “This President always surprises” and assured him that the administration does not intend to leave a vacuum after the visit and will continue the momentum.  The soft side of Melania Trump: The media's spotlight&nbsp;has been following Melania Trump’s hands for a few days now, including&nbsp;a video angle that appeared to show her rejecting her husband’s hand. But in Israel, Melania’s hands might have produced the most touching and human moment of the whole visit. While arriving at the President’s residence on Monday, Nechama Rivlin welcomed Melania out of the limousine, and when the two first ladies walked down the red carpet – they were holding hands. Rivlin, who suffers from a chronic lung disease, has to walk with an oxygen tank, and when she met Melania, she whispered in her ear that she would try to keep up with the pace “but it could be slower.”&nbsp;According to officials in the President’s office, Melania replied: “We will walk with you at any pace you choose,” and embraced her hand strongly. The photo of the two ladies holding hands went viral in Israel, and Mrs. Rivlin wrote a special Facebook post elaborating on their encounter. “In the hustle and bustle of this important and historic visit, I also got to know the First Lady Melania. A charming woman inside and out, sensitive and special,” she wrote of Melania Trump, adding that she gave her a gift, a children’s book titled “Hug” by David Grossman in 3 languages – Hebrew, Arabic and English. “It was great to sit with her and with the wonderful Ivanka who joined us, and to discuss bringing together strangers who might be less afraid of getting closer if they only were interested in each other.”  Everyone was so ecstatic about the warm hug that Trump gave Israel, that nobody was really talking about the mega-billion dollar arms deal the US signed with Saudi Arabia. According to the White House readout of the Trump-Netanyahu meeting, the President assured Netanyahu that the US will maintain Israels qualitative military edge, but Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said today that “we have our ways to deal with it.” Speaking on Army Radio this morning, Liberman reacted to the deal for the first time, stating he does “not live in peace with the whole Mideast arms race. Regional deals have reached $215 billion, which is a significant sum, so I do not live well with the arms race and the huge Saudi acquisition.”&nbsp;In the same interview, Liberman all but confirmed that Trump leaked intelligence that came from Israel, saying that the Defense Ministry “drew conclusions” from the incident.&nbsp;Read today's entire Kafe Knesset here [JewishInsider] &nbsp; TRUMP’S SALES PITCH: “Trump’s Saudi Arabia Trip Figures Into Plan for Palestinian Deal” by Ben Hubbard and Ian Fisher:&nbsp;“With the gusto of a salesman pushing a limited-time offer, [Trump] cast the Saudi monarch in a leading role and invoked his name to push Mr. Netanyahu toward progress with the Palestinians.

First, America is connected to the historical narrative of the Jewish people. He spoke about the links of the Jews to the Holy Land dating back thousands of years. The Jews did not come back to their land as a response to the Holocaust&nbsp;alone. Against a background of centuries of oppression, which he detailed, he assured his Israeli audience that America will stand at Israel's side. Second, he focused on Iran's genocidal threats and offered his own personal guarantee of Israel's security, including that Iran would never obtain nuclear weapons. What was remarkable about his speeches in the Middle East was that his guarantees to the Saudis and his guarantees to Israel did not contradict each other. He understood that the region had fundamentally changed and he was moving American diplomacy forward in recognition of that fact.&quot;  &quot;In Trump's private moments, it's small talk and compliments&quot;&nbsp;by Josef Federman and Aya Batrawy:&nbsp;&quot;President Donald Trump spent part of his two-day visit to Israel with open microphones nearby, giving the world a small glimpse into his private banter with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu between official appearances.

        "text":["<p>“The Sense of an Ending,” the second long feature of Indian director Ritesh Batra (“The Lunchbox”), explores a range of weighty existential problems, such as regret and guilt, anger and jealousy; how memory deceives us, and how we choose to distort it to enable us to bear it. It also ponders the way one person’s actions affect another, even many years after the deed is done, and how the very presence of an individual in another’s life changes the course of that life.</p> \n<p>All these issues are present in the movie, written by playwright Nick Payne based on the novel for which Julian Barnes won the 2011 Man Booker Prize. But neither Payne, for whom this is a first film project, nor Batra, manage to give the questions they explore the necessary depth, leaving them to dissolve into a melodrama that conceals more than it reveals, but never generates the necessary sense of mystery.</p> \n<p>Since “The Sense of an Ending” is a British film, it has all the requisite qualities, above all the performances of the cast, led by Jim Broadbent: His very presence makes the hero more substantial than the screenplay allows for. Broadbent plays Tony Webster, the 70-something owner of a small store that sells cameras, especially Leicas, considered to be the best cameras ever made. Tony is divorced and has an unmarried, pregnant daughter (Michelle Dockery) whom he accompanies to her prenatal classes. He is a grumpy old man, but not aggressively so, and his bite is often tempered by dry humor.</p> \n<p>Tony’s quiet routine is interrupted by the arrival of a letter informing him that someone from his past has left him a sum of money and the diary of an old friend. The money interests Tony less than the diary, which he fails to have delivered to him by mail. To see what he can do about it, he contacts Margaret (Harriet Walter), his ex-wife, a lawyer who would prefer to have nothing to do with him. He tells her the story of the diary, which involves a hugely influential episode from his youth. The fact that Margaret, a resolute if cynical woman, only hears about this episode now, so many years after the divorce, suggests something about the nature of their marriage, and perhaps also about the reasons why it ended.</p> \n<p>Tony’s story unfolds in a series of flashbacks featuring actor Billy Howle as his younger self – a shy, somewhat awkward student. The story also involves the somewhat enigmatic Veronica (Freya Mavor), Tony’s first love (who gave him his first Leica); his brilliant, charismatic friend Adrian (Joe Alwyn); and Sarah (Emily Mortimer), Veronica’s mother, from whom Veronica apparently gets her inscrutable, nonconforming personality. Tony, Veronica and Adrian have a falling-out when Veronica leaves Tony for Adrian; Tony responds to the betrayal in a blunt way he has managed to push out of his memory until the arrival of the letter, which tells him that Sarah was in possession of the late Adrian’s diary. It was she who left the diary to Tony, but Veronica is refusing to send it to him.</p> \n<p>Payne and Batra weave the story between past and present in a conventional way, and the whole movie is directed as a standard British drama. The real problem, however, is that the depiction of the relationships among Tony, Veronica and Adrian lacks depth (Sarah is a minor character, if an important one, in the story). Neither the love Tony felt for Veronica, nor the way he was drawn to Adrian (an attraction that may have had more to it than he is willing to admit) is given real substance. So we are left with only a flimsy basis for understanding the deeply unsettling effect the past has on Tony when it reenters his life in the form of the letter.</p> \n<p>Unanswered questions</p> \n<p>Perhaps that is how Tony chooses to remember his past. However, there is a difference between portraying memory as shallow, as this movie does, and showing how a person reworks memory to suit his emotional needs, which is what “The Sense of an Ending” might have done had it pursued its goals in a complex and probing way. Representing the mechanisms of memory onscreen is one of the most challenging tasks a filmmaker can undertake. Some have done it successfully – French director Alain Resnais tops the list – but Batra is not one of them.</p> \n<p>Therefore, that “sense of an ending” the movie tries to create never materializes. We leave the theater unsatisfied in two ways: first, the film leaves many questions unanswered; and second, the screenplay and humdrum direction do not make us sufficiently curious about what those answers are. The story itself is somehow not very interesting, and at one point we may even wonder why it is being told to us at all.</p> \n<p>These feelings may accord with the overall argument of British literary critic Frank Kermode’s acclaimed theoretical book from 1967, whose title Barnes borrowed (Kermode’s “The Sense of an Ending” explores the ways in which people, both in and out of books, try to give meaning to their lives, in part by locating the ending – or not doing so). But if Payne and Batra are demonstrating Kermode’s theory, they do so in a thin way, without the conceptual validity that would have given the story an additional level and rescued it from seeming bland and trivial.</p> \n<p>I’ll end with a somewhat petty claim, but one I think is relevant to the movie’s limitations. It is often a problem to have two actors play the same character at different ages; do we ever really believe that the younger actor grew up to become the older one? In the case of young Tony maturing into Jim Broadbent, it kind of works; but when we are asked to accept that Freya Mavor grows up to be Charlotte Rampling, whom we finally meet toward the end of the movie, it doesn’t work at all. Lovely Mavor looks like dozens of other young women; Rampling’s face is so distinctive that it is impossible to accept Mavor – or, perhaps, any actress – as her younger self. Rampling’s brief appearance adds a quality, authority and elegance to the film which Mavor, for all her pleasantness as young Veronica, never even hints at. Maybe that’s how it is when you’re young, or how it is when people decide what to remember about you; maybe there were signs in the past that Veronica would someday become Charlotte Rampling, and Tony simply missed them. But he did miss them, or doesn’t remember them; therefore, the audience can’t, either.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Data from the Central Bureau of Statistics reveal that nearly 20 percent of the children who came to Israel from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s has since moved abroad. Furthermore, Russian-speaking immigrants at the peak of their creative powers are more inclined to leave than other immigrant groups. They are also several times more likely to leave than their native-born Israeli counterparts.</p> \n<p>About 17 percent of the children of Russian parents who immigrated to the Holy Land in the early and mid-1990s have since emigrated, either to other Western countries or their native land, according to the data, which was requested by Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Although there is no official information about the education levels of immigrants who leave the country, a study conducted about a decade ago by Eric Gould and Omer Moav at the Hebrew University found that the brain drain among former Russian immigrants was particularly high.</p> \n<p>“The emigrants have a relatively clear profile: most are young and educated,” says Dr. Michael Philippov, from Jerusalem’s Myers-JDC Brookdale Institute. He has done years of research on the 1990s wave of Russian aliyah.</p> \n<p>“This is a major national problem,” says Prof. Larissa Remennick, a Bar-Ilan University sociologist who is researching “Generation 1.5” – those who fall between the immigrant generation and the native-born one. “Israel is not making sufficient efforts to retain these talented and educated young adults who were brought here with such a major investment,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Israel has been making huge efforts in arranging aliyah – in looking for Jews, half- and quarter-Jews in every corner of a huge Russia,” she continues. “They bring them to programs such as Na’aleh and Sela and Birthright, and whatnot, just so they come. But when they do come, they allow them to fend for themselves as they try to keep their heads above water. That’s particularly true regarding the large [Russian] aliyah of the early 1990s.”</p> \n<p>CBS figures show that between 1990 and 1996, some 650,000 immigrants moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union. About 185,000 of them were less than 20 years old. But the data reveal that some 32,000 of them (17.3 percent) no longer live in Israel.</p> \n<p>For purposes of comparison, the emigration rate is between 11 and 13 percent among all immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Among native Israelis born between 1970 and 1995, the emigration rate is much lower – about 5 percent.</p> \n<p>However, Hebrew University’s Prof. Sergio DellaPergola – who studies Jewish migration – counseled caution over the numbers. “The expectation that everyone will come and not a single person will leave is baseless,” he says. “Jews are immigrants, like everyone else. Of course the added value of the ideological and religious direction is very important. But we are dealing with human beings who need to work and earn a living, to adjust and be happy.”</p> \n<p>DellaPergola and Remennick agree that the emigration of young, educated people is, among other things, a by-product of the good education they receive in Israel, along with the country’s relatively limited job market.</p> \n<p>Prof. Yossi Harpaz, from the sociology and anthropology department at Tel Aviv University, who also studies migration, says the emigration of young educated people is typical of relatively wealthy countries.</p> \n<p>“People with higher human capital are inclined to look for opportunities in larger, wealthier countries,” says Harpaz. “That’s in contrast to emigration from countries such as Turkey and Mexico, where it is actually the poorer and less well-connected people who seek to leave.”</p> \n<p>Harpaz may be referring to people like Ilana Dvorkin, a management engineer who moved from Be'er Sheva to Montreal nine years ago.&nbsp;&quot;I was in the last year at university and my husband had just started a career service,&quot; she recalls.&nbsp;&quot;We decided we had nothing to lose, and that if we wanted to make a change, we had to do it then.&quot; Their decision was also based on fear, she says, following a spate of terror attacks in Israel.</p> \n<p>Philippov, meanwhile, suggests looking at emigration data with a more critical eye. “Anyone who was satisfied that there were fewer emigrants this year than the year before should ask what will happen if one year all of those who want to leave do so. The year after that, we would report no emigration. Would we be happy with that?”</p> \n<p>DellaPergola suggests that among those who are not Jewish according to religious law (i.e., they were not born to a Jewish mother), the emigration rate is particularly high. He points a finger at the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, which is responsible for conversion of residents in the country. He called the Rabbinate’s conversion policy “selective and lazy, and not in keeping with the supply.”</p> \n<p>But the percentage of non-Jews among those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union in the early ’90s is a relatively low 11.2 percent, so it’s hard to believe the lack of recognition of Jewish identity is a major reason these immigrants leave as adults.</p> \n<p>However, it was a factor for Daniel Tkatch, who came to Israel from Kazakhstan in 1992, at age 13. He could have been a successful engineer, but emigrated to Germany immediately after receiving his degree in materials engineering from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.</p> \n<p>“I was integrated according to all the formal parameters, but I’m not a Jew and was always reminded of that,” he says. “It caused a type of schizophrenic split within me. It follows me to this day: this feeling that I’m not what I really am, and this unending search for what’s wrong with me. It’s something internal that interferes with your life, and with accepting your whole self.”</p> \n<p>Tkatch says he hadn’t clearly formulated his reasons for leaving when he departed. “I just ran,” he says. “I fled the lack of a future.” In retrospect, he understands one of the things that pushed him to leave was the Zionist ideology, plus his inability to reconcile the concepts of “Jewish” and “democratic.”</p> \n<p>Sophie (not her real name), 37, left Israel two years ago with her husband and two daughters, after being accepted to a postdoctoral program in New York. She doesn’t plan to return to Israel, to which she came from Ukraine, in 1990 with her parents. She lived a typical Israeli life – army service, followed by university, a job and then marriage. Before leaving for New York, she lived with her family in the Tel Aviv suburb of Givatayim. She does not intend to pursue an academic career after her postdoctoral work.</p> \n<p>“We wanted to try living in New York, and if we liked it we would stay,” she says. “The postdoctorate is necessary to continue in academia, but it’s also a good means of living legally in the United States for a time.”</p> \n<p>Sophie and her family didn’t have a bad life in Israel. Her husband, a high-tech programmer, earned a good living, while she had received a generous scholarship and studied life sciences. But the opportunities for future development were limited. The couple felt they had reached their maximum income potential, but still couldn’t afford to buy an apartment in the places where they wanted to live.</p> \n<p>Sophie adds that the security issue in Israel had started to stress her out. Referring to the 2014 war with Hamas in Gaza, Sophie notes: “When rockets fell on Tel Aviv [none actually hit Tel Aviv, because they were intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system], it was already too much – especially when there are little children sleeping and it’s not clear what to do.”</p> \n<p>Sophie says there are major disparities among schools for her children in the United States, but it was possible to choose between them. In Israel, she says, the choice was more limited and the level of education did not meet her standards. She also hesitantly admits that in Israel she was bothered that her daughters spoke to her in Hebrew (rather than Russian), but now she is less bothered by their speaking English.</p> \n<p>In addition to Israel, sizeable number of Jews leaving the former Soviet Union in the ’90s went to the United States, Canada and Germany. There are no official figures that would allow for comparing the rate of emigration from those countries. However, Remennick says that, based on expert assessments and personal meetings abroad, she believes the inclination of talented and educated former Soviet Jews to leave those countries is lower than their counterparts in Israel.</p> \n<p>“That’s not surprising,” she says, “because we have a small country with a small job market and very limited opportunities.”</p> \n<p>But Remennick believes emigration also enriches Israel. “In the fields of science and the arts, it doesn’t necessarily matter where a person lives. Anyone who lives here at least 10 years is infected by the Israeli ‘virus’ and isn’t able to cut his ties to the country completely.”</p> \n<p>A study conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute in 2009 (with Philippov’s participation) showed that half of young people who had originated in the former Soviet Union unequivocally linked their future to Israel, compared to 80 percent of young, native-born Israelis, and that less than 30 percent of the young Russian speakers wanted to raise their children in Israel. A study commissioned by the Russian-language Israeli website Newsru, published last week, showed more moderate numbers, with 66 percent saying they weren’t planning to leave Israel, and only 4 percent to 5 percent weighing a move abroad.</p> \n<p>Philippov says there are two types of factors pushing Russian-born young adults to emigrate; some are common to all young adults in Israel, while others are unique to them. “The Israeli middle class is suffering from the cost of living,” he notes. “The situation becomes a lot more complex when a young family isn’t supported at all by their parents, or in cases in which the parents need their children’s help. That’s the typical reality of immigrant families and is less typical of ‘sabra’ families.”</p> \n<p>The lack of separation between religion and state is also an issue troubling large parts of Israeli society, but the lack of civil marriage can be a serious problem for immigrants – who are more likely to face obstacles to marrying in Israel. Additionally, “A migrant may feel fewer sentiments toward a country in which he wasn’t born or raised,” says Philippov. “He has fewer family ties encouraging him to stay.”</p> \n<p>After leaving Israel, Tkatch has become a German citizen and renounced his Israeli citizenship. He says giving up his Israeli passport was a liberating move, but immediately after getting German citizenship, he moved to Brussels. “Again I was an immigrant,” he says.</p> \n<p>Sophie, meanwhile, says it wasn’t until she was living in New York that she recognized what bothered her about Israel. “When I got here, I saw that everything was much calmer and more polite. People know how to line up for the bus without pushing, they don’t talk on their cellphone on public transportation – and if they do, they lower their voices. Everyone is polite in the stores, and it’s customary to hold the door open for one another. That’s something I still have to learn; I’m not used to it.”</p> \n<p>Philippov notes it is in Israel’s interest to ascertain how many of its best and brightest young people have been lost in recent years. “Why did we lose them? This is an important question from a socioeconomic perspective,” he says.</p>",

President Obama could declare his&nbsp;willingness to veto this resolution in an instant but instead is pushing it. This is an abandonment of Israel&nbsp;which breaks decades of US policy of protecting Israel at the UN and undermines the prospects of working with the next administration of advancing peace.&quot;&nbsp;[Twitter]  Jay Solomon:&nbsp;&quot;Israel believed US &amp; Palestinians were &quot;coordinating&quot; in preparing new UN resolution on Mideast peace process, says an Israeli official.&quot;&nbsp;[Twitter]  David Horovitz:&nbsp;&quot;If — and as of this writing, we are still in “if” territory — the administration was, perhaps still is, ready to forgo its UN veto and let a Palestinian-designed resolution gain passage in the UN Security Council, condemning all settlements and potentially inviting new international diplomatic and financial pressure against Israel, it will instead have chosen a course of action that could sabotage its admirable two-term history of defending Israel’s against those international players that wish it ill. It will have essentially sided against Israel with those negative forces.&nbsp;It will have reversed and made a mockery of its own previous pledges and positions — notably when it vetoed a similar resolution five years ago with the explanation that the Security Council was not the right venue for tackling issues that need to be resolved by the parties themselves.&quot;&nbsp;[ToI]  Brent Sasley:&nbsp;&quot;At this point of Obama presidency likely only consequence would be to tar Obama's name among many Jewish-Israelis &amp; US Jews.&quot;&nbsp;[Twitter]  Mark Dubowitz:&nbsp;&quot;As Aleppo burns, 500,000 dead Syrians, global chaos, Obama spends last 27 days cementing legacy as most anti-Israel president ever.&quot;&nbsp;[Twitter]  BEHIND THE SCENES&nbsp;-- “In a day of tweets, Trump suggests major change on national security issues” by Karen DeYoung:&nbsp;“Once it became clear late Wednesday that the settlements vote was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, Trump officials said the transition gave the administration a “heads-up” that the president-elect was going to publicly call for a U.S. veto After initial hesitation on whether Trump should weigh in, the statement was written late Wednesday by&nbsp;Jared Kushner... and&nbsp;Stephen K. Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, according to two people briefed on the deliberation who were not authorized to speak publicly. They said that Kushner and Bannon consulted with several allies in Israel and the United States but declined to name them. The effort represented perhaps Kushner’s most significant foray to date into foreign policy and the Middle East, where Trump has said he would welcome his son-in-law’s involvement.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  Robert Costa:&nbsp;&quot;Kushner and Bannon worked together all night Wednesday on the&nbsp;UN&nbsp;Israel issue, per several people familiar with the discussions.&quot;&nbsp;[Twitter]  “Israelis called Trump to weigh in ahead of UN Security Council vote” by Elise Labott, Oren&nbsp;Liebermann&nbsp;and Nicole Gaouette:&nbsp;“The Israeli official told CNN that his country also approached the Trump campaign after it felt that it had failed to persuade the Obama administration to veto the planned vote. The official said that Israel &quot;implored the White House not to go ahead and told them that if they did, we would have no choice but to reach out to President-elect Trump. We did reach out to the President-elect and are deeply appreciative that he weighed in, which was not a simple thing to do,&quot; the official said.”&nbsp;[CNN;&nbsp;Haaretz]&nbsp;  “Trump discussed Mideast peace in&nbsp;call&nbsp;with Egypt's Sisi” by Emily Stephenson:&nbsp;“Trump discussed laying the groundwork for peace in the Middle East in a phone call on Thursday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Trump transition official said. The official did not know whether Trump and Sisi talked specifically about Egypt's decision to postpone a vote... on a resolution demanding that Israel end settlement building.”&nbsp;[Reuters]&nbsp;  -- “In a statement,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Sisi's office said the two leaders had agreed the new US administration should be given a chance to deal with the issue.&nbsp;However, four other members of the security council warned that if Egypt did not press ahead with its resolution before the end of Thursday, other member states would do so. New Zealand, Venezuela, Malaysia&nbsp;and Senegal said they reserved the right to move ahead with the vote.”&nbsp;[BBC]&nbsp;  ---&nbsp;&quot;Asked about Mr. Trump’s comments, a visibly upset Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour, said, “He is acting on behalf of Netanyahu.”&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]&nbsp;  Ambassador Dermer:&nbsp;“Israel deeply appreciates the clear and unequivocal call of President-elect Donald Trump to veto anti-Israel resolution at the UN.”&nbsp;[Twitter]&nbsp;  Jerusalem's view of the White House:&nbsp;&quot;Israeli officials believed the Obama administration had planned its abstention for some time, and was angered by Egypt's decision to suddenly change course. The goal of the White House, according to the Israeli government's assessment, was to let off a parting shot at a prime minister with whom it has fought for years and to bind the incoming administration with new international language.&quot;&nbsp;[JPost]  &quot;Pressure Mounting on Obama with UN Resolution’s Fate Unclear&quot; by JI's Aaron Magid:&nbsp;&quot;Remember you have all of these allies and adversaries out there trying to figure out what is Trump going to do when he actually becomes President,” explained&nbsp;Aaron David Miller... “I am not sure (Egyptian President) Sisi wants to put himself in a position as one of the opening acts of the administration to be on the wrong side of Mr. Trump on this issue.” FDD's&nbsp;Jonathan Schanzer&nbsp;credited “the deepening strategic ties between Egypt and Israel” in an interview with&nbsp;Jewish Insider... Since the Obama Administration’s likely intended for the&nbsp;settlement resolution&nbsp;to pass, Miller cited Obama’s personal ideological commitment to the Palestinian cause motivating him to abstain. &nbsp;“Frustration and real resentment that the Israelis weren’t listening combined with the fact that the administration was running out of time propelled them either to abstain or to vote in favor,” he explained.&quot;  -- WHAT IF Hillary had won? What would have happened yesterday?&nbsp;“A lot of Democrats would like for him to veto. The party is in bad shape, not only did they lose the presidential election but they also lost both houses of Congress,” CFR's&nbsp;Elliott Abrams&nbsp;told&nbsp;Jewish Insider. “They don’t need things that weaken the party further yet Obama is willing to see that happen. Had Clinton won, he would have had even less reason to be concerned about the condition of the Democratic Party,” Abrams added.&quot;  Jonathan Schanzer:&nbsp;&quot;I could imagine that Hillary would have said, 'Don’t do this to me right now.' She probably wouldn’t have done it publicly, she probably would have done it privately saying. 'You are going to tie my hands as the next president you are going to make my life more difficult because it will appear as if I gave my blessing to this Security Council resolution.' It would have complicated her relationship with Netanyahu and the Israeli government at a time when she had been promising a lot of her supporters that things were going to change and they were going to get demonstrably better after a very rocky 8 years with Obama.&quot;  Aaron David Miller:&nbsp;&quot;If she would have won, they would have consulted with her. She would have had to make a judgment that she was pretty hard over on settlements but not nearly as intensely as the President. In fact, if you look closely at her memoir, she didn’t want to box the Israelis in. They would have gone to her and said, 'We don’t want to box you in, are you ok with it?' I don’t know what she would have said. Part of her would have said I don’t want to be in a fight with the Israelis as my first foreign policy challenge. She might have basically cautioned. But we don’t know.&quot;&nbsp;[JewishInsider]&nbsp;  DRIVING THE CONVERSATION:&nbsp;“Trump, Obama on&nbsp;possible&nbsp;collision course over Israeli settlement vote” by Karen DeYoung:&nbsp;“The resolution, promoted by liberal Jewish groups in the United States, has been the subject of intense debate in recent days within the Obama administration. Secretary of State&nbsp;John F. Kerry&nbsp;has pushed for a clear statement of position before the administration leaves office. A Kerry speech outlining the U.S. stance that was tentatively scheduled for Thursday morning appeared to have been canceled within two hours of its planned delivery, according to U.S. officials, who said the matter remained unsettled within the administration.”&nbsp;[WashPost]&nbsp;  HEARD LAST NIGHT - Malcolm Hoenlein on David Greenfield’s weekly radio show:&nbsp;“I spoke to people in the administration, including Secretary Kerry's office, this morning, and they themselves did not know The administration played its cards very close to the vest, did not indicate at any time. I met with the US Ambassador (Samantha Power) and she said that at that point she did not know. It's a little strange that we had no indication from them, but there's broad speculation that there might not have been a veto...&nbsp;It would be a terrible way for them to go out of office, as well as I think with broader implications for the Democratic party &nbsp;[Trump’s statement] had an impact in the region and certainly with the Egyptians, who are aware of it. He has challenged the role of the United Nations and the bias against Israel there. I think for countries, including Egypt, looking forward the next four years, you have to take that very seriously. It was a message.”  “Trump's Ambassador Could (Accidentally) Benefit Israel” by Daniel Gordis:&nbsp;“Netanyahu and Abbas may both realize that time is actually not on their side. Could this be the moment for them to compromise and to try to negotiate a real deal? Friedman would not like it, but he would not be able to overrule an Israeli electorate in favor. Abbas could go down in history as something other than a failure. Netanyahu claims to want such a deal. If Israelis and Palestinians would broker the deal without American intervention, the American Jewish right could not stop the accord in Washington or in the Israeli government.”&nbsp;[Bloomberg]&nbsp;  Jewish Journal’s David Suissa: “Why J Street should welcome Trump and Friedman:&nbsp;“Donald Trump is that high energy electric shock to the heart; Friedman and others are there to follow his voltage. If Prime Minister Netanyahu is serious about his talks without preconditions, Trump will help him get there. You may have a nasty taste in your mouth for outspoken types like Trump, but you can’t deny two things. One, he is not ruling out a two-state solution, and two, he will bring a defibrillator to the operation.”&nbsp;[JewishJournal]&nbsp;  Ivanka Trump Accosted by Passenger on JetBlue Flight:&nbsp;“Ivanka was on a JetBlue flight leaving JFK Thursday morning with her family when a passenger started screaming, &quot;Your father is ruining the country.&quot; The guy went on, &quot;Why is she on our flight? She should be flying private.&quot; A passenger on the flight tells TMZ Ivanka ignored the guy and tried distracting her kids with crayons. JetBlue personnel escorted the unruly passenger off the flight. As he was removed he screamed, &quot;You're kicking me off for expressing my opinion?!!&quot; The husband of the unruly passenger tweeted an hour before the plane took off, &quot;Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial. My husband chasing them down to harass them.&quot;”&nbsp;[TMZ] &nbsp;“What actually occurred is unclear, and Lasner's entire Twitter account has since gone down.”&nbsp;[CNN]&nbsp;  Account by the&nbsp;man seated in front of Ivanka:&nbsp;&quot;When he got on and saw her, sitting behind me, he said &quot;oh my god. This is a nightmare&quot; and was visibly shaking. He said &quot;they ruin the country now they ruin our flight!&quot; He did not yell. He was also not what I would describe as calm. Agitated maybe...

Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, is particularly close with Cohn. One former Goldman executive told me that if Kushner can’t take a West Wing post for legal reasons, Cohn will be his proxy inside the administration But conservatives around Trump are skeptical of Cohn, who’s donated to both Republicans and Democrats. According to sources, Cohn has upset right-wing members of the White House economic team by attempting to block the appointment of CNBC commentator and avowed supply-sider Larry Kudlow to chair the Council of Economic Advisers.”&nbsp;[NYMag]&nbsp;  “Trump Rewards Kellyanne Conway With a Top White House Staff Slot” by Michael Shear and Maggie Haberman:&nbsp;“Mr. Trump is deeply fond of Ms. Conway, whose job as counselor will give her frequent access to the president She has reportedly clashed at times with Mr. Priebus and Mr. Kushner.

But world events now happen faster than they used to, and Americans expect a response from their president, vacationing or not.

And I rejected them completely.” Ellison, who has routinely voted for defense assistance to Israel, also for the first time regretted his exceptional vote against additional missile defense assistance for Israel during the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas “I cast a vote reflecting my commitment to restoring calm and quiet at a moment of violence,” he said... “My voice was not being heard and I felt in the moment that casting my vote was a vital way to amplify my message. It was the wrong way to speak out and it was the wrong way to vote.

The Russian subsidiary pleaded guilty. The parent company also agreed to pay $236 million in disgorgement and interest to the SEC... Erez Vigodman,&nbsp;Teva’s president and chief executive, said in a statement Thursday that the conduct leading to the investigation had ended years ago, calling the behavior “regrettable and unacceptable.”&quot;&nbsp;[WSJ]&nbsp;  KAFE KNESSET -- by Tal Shalev:&nbsp;Suspicion regarding Arab lawmaker Basel Ghattas, who allegedly smuggled cellphones and passed information to numerous Fatah prisoners sitting in Israeli security prisons, continued to captivate the Knesset this week. On Thursday, hours after having his immunity revoked, Ghattas was arrested by Israeli police. While Ghattas continues to dismiss the allegations as political persecution, the Knesset is confronting an unprecedented situation, raising various legal complexities and question marks. This is the first time in history a sitting MK has been arrested: Is he allowed to vote in the plenum? Will he still earn a salary? Can he even come to the Knesset?  According to the law, Ghattas could even demand to attend Knesset votes while he is under arrest, and can be suspended only after he is indicted. Next week, the parliament's ethics committee will convene to discuss various petitions–such as one calling for the annulment of Ghattas' right to participate in parliamentary activity. The coalition – and mainly members of the Likud party – are pushing to exercise the newly legislated impeachment bill, and since early this week Likud minister Zeev Elkin has been gathering signatures to initiate the process with a hearing. Elkin reached 60 signatures, but is missing the required 10 opposition MKs, who so far are adamantly refusing to join the initiative.  After Ghattas's arrest, Elkin is continuing his push, targeting Yair Lapid and his centrist party Yesh Atid as the main obstacle to his move, accusing him of protecting Ghattas. &quot;Yair Lapid should wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and tell himself that he is the reason Ghattas is still an MK,&quot; he said this week. Lapid, for his part, has also vowed that he &quot;will not rest until Ghattas is out of the Knesset,&quot; but has been objecting to the suggested Knesset intervention, claiming it could drag on for years and that the criminal procedure will be much more quick and effective. Earlier this week, even Netanyahu threw himself into the political firestorm surrounding Elkin's petition, accusing Lapid of being &quot;a leftist who stands at the head of a leftist party.&quot; Lapid, currently perceived as Netanyahu's biggest challenger in the next election, has been trying to brand himself as a center-right leader, so the tactic is aimed at pressuring him to join the call. However, the direct confrontation from Netanyahu actually encouraged Lapid, as it also positions him as the PM's main rival.&nbsp;  TALK OF THE TOWN -- “No, A Jewish Family Didn’t &quot;Flee&quot; Town After Being Blamed For Christmas Play Cancellation” by Jim Dalrymple II:&nbsp;“The story seemingly escalated further when local news website Lancaster Online reported that a Jewish family “fled the county in fear because it’s being blamed for the cancellation.” The newspaper’s story did not name the family, but claimed to have spoken to them and reported that the parents became fearful and left town after seeing reaction to the Breitbart and Fox stories However, the Anti-Defamation League tracked down the family and discovered that they did not, in fact, flee. According to a statement released Thursday evening, “ADL investigated, and found that in actuality, the family left on vacation for winter break.” The statement goes on to call reports that the family fled “untrue and damaging.””&nbsp;[BuzzFeed;&nbsp;JTA] &nbsp;  Weekend LongRead: &quot;Inside Ivanka and Tiffany Trump’s Complicated Sister Act&quot; by Sarah Ellison:&nbsp;&quot;Years later, when an interviewer asked Ivanka whether she understood the consternation in the Jewish community after her father’s campaign tweeted an accusatory picture of&nbsp;Hillary Clinton&nbsp;next to the Star of David, Ivanka shot back that she thought the outcry was “ridiculous” because her father clearly did not think that the symbol was a Star of David. (Ivanka has told friends that her father wore a yarmulke at her wedding, and that “if my father had an anti-Semitic bone in his body, I would know about it.”)&nbsp;  &quot;This past spring, as her father was preparing for the Republican convention, Ivanka asked Rabbi Lookstein, one of the most prominent rabbis in the country, if he would deliver an opening invocation. He agreed. But when the Ramaz alumni heard that their rabbi would be appearing on a stage with Trump... they circulated a blistering petition to protest his participation... Rabbi Lookstein backed down. One member of the Ramaz alumni group told me that the incident isolated Ivanka in the school community. “You are dropping off your daughter at Ramaz every day,” this person said, “where the alumni association says that your father is so despicable that the rabbi’s mere presence for three minutes is too much?” ... That member added that negative feelings about her father do not extend to Ivanka. Whatever the reality, the episode has left scars.&quot;&nbsp;[VanityFair]&nbsp;  Yitz Applbaum on the Wine of the Week -- Alexander the Great – Amarolo:&nbsp;On certain rare occasions an encounter with even the greatest of wines can be overshadowed by the larger experience itself. This week in Paris was just such an occasion.&nbsp;I was sitting in an overstuffed leather chair, smoking Cuban cigars with my eldest son and a new friend (a great leader of the Moroccan Jewish Community), in the private smoking room of the new Peninsula Hotel. Steak, foie gras and cold cuts were staring us in the face.&nbsp;  Out comes the Alexander the Great Amarolo 2011. This is a wine so robust and present that in most situations it would not be overshadowed. There is an early impression of fermentation still going on the front palate. By mid-palate the wine drinker comes to terms, and has even accepted, the repercussions of a 40-month barrel-aging process. By the finish, the deep purple liquid becomes a soft silk and the taste comes through the heavy oak. The wine is comprised of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Cabernet Franc, 4% Shiraz and 3% Grenache.

        "text":["<p>For over four decades, feminist lawyer and academic Catharine MacKinnon has been passionately working to end inequality, especially – but certainly not only – for women.</p> \n<p>She fights against sexual harassment, prostitution, pornography, snuff films, sex trafficking, child sexual abuse and genocidal rape. And yet, while in Israel to promote her newest book, “Butterfly Politics,” she brings a positive message: Even the smallest actions in a collective context can change whole systems.</p> \n<p>A pioneer in legal theory and practice, MacKinnon is a professor of law at the University of Michigan and a visiting professor at Harvard Law School, with a BA from Smith College and PhDs in political science and law from Yale.</p> \n<p>She spoke to Haaretz at the guest residence of Jerusalem’s Mishkenot Sha’ananim cultural center, which overlooks the Old City walls – and, MacKinnon is quick to note, the separation barrier in the near distance. She speaks carefully and rarely needs to search for a word or phrase as her long, slender fingers punctuate her thoughts.</p> \n<p>“Butterfly Politics” is a retrospective of her work. “I have done a lot of theory and a lot of practice what I have not done much of is theorize my practice,” MacKinnon says. “The idea of ‘Butterfly Politics’ is my attempt to reflect on 40 years of intervening for social equality through law.”</p> \n<p>The title refers to chaos theory’s butterfly effect, as posited by American theoretical meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz, who famously asked, “Does the flap of a butterfly’s wing in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?”</p> \n<p>Yes, MacKinnon answers, wryly adding, “And since societies have changed the weather more than law has changed male dominance, there is a certain symmetry in the metaphor. Chaos doesn’t mean lack of pattern – rather, it means that the patterns aren’t linear or immediately clear and that causality is complex, interactive and actually repetitive. To me, that sounds a lot like law and society.”</p> \n<p>The butterfly moment refers to a particular intervention or doing that sets off a pattern of change, and it is neither theoretical nor abstract. “All butterfly moments are deeply imprinted by the reality of those whose lives produced them. This is especially true for the legal claim for genocidal rape,” MacKinnon says.</p> \n<p>“My Bosnian Muslim and Croat clients from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who were raped in the Serb-led genocide knew it was genocidal, although the law didn’t. They were determined to fight what was done to them on the terms on which it was done and to create international accountability that named and responded to what happened to them in real life.”</p> \n<p>MacKinnon’s contribution in the prosecution of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who in 2016 was found guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in collaboration with the Milosevic regime in Serbia, led to the first judicial recognition of the role of rape in genocide under international law.</p> \n<p>“The power of political law for women comes less from the law and more from the women and the politics,” MacKinnon says. Indeed, she recalls, this is how she became aware of the need to create political change through law.</p> \n<p>Coercion and a lack of real choice</p> \n<p>A young student at Yale at the height of the feminist movement on college campuses, she participated in consciousness-raising groups. Listening to women’s stories, she became aware of how prevalent sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace really were – and how the law was completely disconnected from women’s lived experiences.</p> \n<p>“The law permits sexual predation by dominant groups on subordinate groups. These laws are justified by a political theory that justifies the rule of rulers over the ruled and calls that consent – which I don’t remember ever having given. Consent means acquiescence, compliance, being rolled by power under circumstances of coercion and lack of real choice,” MacKinnon says.</p> \n<p>“It is intrinsically unequal. You can’t consent to inequality. If you get paid half of what others are paid for the same work, and you accept your half pay, that doesn’t make it equal. In a context of coercion by inequality, vulnerability produces acquiescence but it has nothing to do with what a person actually wants.”</p> \n<p>Many of her ideas are now at the foundation of legal and political discourse. But her 40-year career has not been easy. She has often been attacked as too strident, too extreme, too feminist, too anti-male or too radical. When she argued against pornography, demanding that it be viewed as a violation of rights and abuse, even some feminists argued that her ideas limited free speech and were dangerously close to conservatism.</p> \n<p>In her review of her work, butterfly moments have led to positive change. And yet, despite the changes, Donald Trump was elected president. And women voted for him.</p> \n<p>MacKinnon sighs. “Women voting for Trump show, among other things, that misogyny is not confined to men. A majority of white women voted for their class and racial privileges. African-American women overwhelmingly did not vote for him – in the high-90 percentile,” she says.</p> \n<p>“I think the fact that his appeal was racist and that he is an admitted sexual predator helped him among some groups of white men who feel challenged by women’s equality and want to be ‘men’ again – that is, dominant and aggressive.”</p> \n<p>MacKinnon attributes Trump’s election to authoritarianism. “Trump pushes the simplest buttons to get the simplest reactions,” she says. “The mobilizing appeal that he uses comes out of familiar authoritarian playbooks – blame the other people, push on the economic- and security-panic side.”</p> \n<p>I ask her if the authoritarian right might be having its own butterfly moments.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think Trump was aware of the exact historical resonances of his authoritarianism, although they are precise. I believe Bannon is,” she says, referring to the White House chief strategist.&nbsp;“This has been building for a long time. Butterfly moments aren’t limited to my politics.”</p> \n<p>MacKinnon has visited Israel numerous times, often to lecture at universities and conduct workshops with students. “People in my audiences here ask brilliant questions. It is a particular relief to come from the United States and the United Kingdom,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Here, people can think collectively and structurally. In the U.S., all of the training, theory and validation by power rewards is on the level of thinking individually. Here, people understand structural issues, collective problems. They know how to go from a structural analysis to the individual or dyadic analysis – which is essential, for instance, in defining a crime like rape on an inequality ground.”</p> \n<p>Less hope in Israel than before</p> \n<p>But MacKinnon senses a change from previous visits. “There is pain and the tensions have always been on the surface – on both the Israeli and the Palestinian side,” she says. “There’s less denial here of the unacceptability of things than anywhere in the world. The determination, the same sense that this cannot go on, is the same, but there is less hope.”</p> \n<p>Many Israelis, MacKinnon says, know they must simultaneously fight the occupation, the subjugation of some men by other men, and the subjection of women by men, because they are connected. “The subordination of some men by other men is part of the masculinist project – male politics, meaning politics – and then when men subordinate women in their communities on both sides, the occupation makes redress almost impossible. That’s what the occupation does,” she says.</p> \n<p>“It’s the same conversation, approached from different angles – except that those who talk about the occupation without talking about male dominance aren’t paying attention to the way the male dominance perpetuates the occupation, providing a strong interest and incentive to continue it. Not to mention that they are ignoring those Israeli men of all communities who don’t think weaponized masculinity is the world’s greatest gift, who dissent from its violent forms and who want an equal world.”</p> \n<p>She knows that Israel’s Council for Higher Education recently voted to&nbsp;broaden the definition of who is eligible to apply for segregated studies at the country’s universities. She responds that the issue of sex segregation for students can be complex.</p> \n<p>“I’m not saying that the only way to become human is to be around the other sex, and I think there can be an empowering aspect to being with women; for example, women’s colleges in the U.S.,&quot; she says, and then adds &quot;but that men can’t learn from women, yet women can learn from men? That is an appalling limit on women’s employment opportunities and on men’s education. Women have a lot to say and men and women should hear them.”</p> \n<p>In her work for and with women, MacKinnon faces the most horrible crimes against women imaginable. How does she cope, how does she remain optimistic?</p> \n<p>“I don’t do optimism,” she answers quickly. “I do determination. People share their trauma and pain with me, thinking that it will matter somehow . I feel honored, and I feel chosen in a way. My part in the project is to be open and to actually feel what they are saying, even with tears streaming down my face. It is a project of being accountable to who they think I am, of learning and becoming through their telling.”</p> \n<p>Is this who she thought she would become four decades ago at Yale?</p> \n<p>“I don’t think that way. I grew up on a farm in the Midwest. My father was a lawyer; maybe we were privileged compared to others there was not a lot of money most of the time, but money was not what we valued. Nor was intelligence, actually,” she says.</p> \n<p>“My father valued competence and craft. He took me to see how our neighbor made sausages, praising the exact right way to do things. I take a much broader view in my work, with theory and analysis or the larger picture. But yes, competence and craft matter.”</p> \n<p>The idea of butterfly politics, she says, inspires interventions, even tiny ones. “In isolation, butterflies are delicate and fragile. On its life journey, a butterfly can be collected and categorized in a box. It can die for lack of nutrition. It can be smashed against a windshield. But still we rise everywhere.</p> \n<p>“So I say: Equality seekers, spread your wings. You’re stronger than you know. And butterflies – sometimes even one – cannot be stopped.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli cabinet approved a plan Sunday to reverse the worsening shortfall of high-tech personnel by spending 900 million shekels ($235.7 million) on education and training, and allowing up to 500 experts in the field to work in Israel.</p> \n<p>The ambitious six-year program aims to ultimately increase by 40% the number of students pursuing engineering and other studies related to high-tech at the country’s institutes of higher education.</p> \n<p>While the emphasis will be on training at the universities, the initiative will also work to upgrade skills and interest in tech among hundreds of teenagers through coding boot camps. The Israel Defense Forces, which is already the single-biggest training ground for the tech industry, will also pitch in by boosting the number of recruits serving in tech-related jobs.</p> \n<p>“The main problem we have in the industry is meeting demand, and for that we need a trained workforce at the highest level,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ministers at the cabinet meeting.</p> \n<p>Israel’s high-tech industry enjoyed its best year ever in 2016, with startup companies raising a combined $4.8 billion – an 11% increase over 2015 – even as the U.S. industry is showing signs of flagging growth. Israeli companies have carved out niches in some of the hottest areas of high-tech, including cybersecurity and self-driving cars.</p> \n<p>But Israel’s colleges and universities haven’t been churning out engineers and software professionals at the pace the industry needs, pushing salaries higher and making companies less competitive globally, and threatening the industry’s continued growth.</p> \n<p>A recent estimate by the Israel Innovation Authority estimated that the labor shortfall will reach more than 10,000 over the next decade.</p> \n<p>“The Israeli economy has undergone a dramatic change with the rapid growth of the tech sector,” said Avi Simhon, head of the National Economic Council and part of the team that prepared the plan. “From a debt-ridden, crisis-plagued country, a strong and stable economy has emerged that produces technology that is sought the world over. The decision the government took Sunday aims to add fuel to the high-tech locomotive and remove obstacles.”</p> \n<p>In addition to increasing the number of engineers and software professionals, the program will also target segments of the Israeli population underrepresented in the industry – including women, ultra-Orthodox Jews and Israeli Arabs – with specialized programs.</p> \n<p>Defense Ministry Director General Udi Adam will oversee military efforts to boost the number of tech jobs in the army, whose 8200 intelligence unit and Mamram computer unit have been major sources of technological talent over the last two decades.</p> \n<p>The government said the 500 tech experts being welcomed to help fight the skills shortfall are expected to be mostly Israelis currently living abroad. However, it added that non-Israelis would be recruited as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The governing coalition on Sunday postponed by three months consideration of a private member’s bill to facilitate the expulsion of terrorists’ families, fearing that it could weaken existing powers in this regard.</p> \n<p>The ostensible purpose of the delay is to allow Interior Minister Arye Dery to look into submitting a similar government bill. But sources in the coalition said they expected the legislative initiative would ultimately be abandoned.</p> \n<p>Current law enables the interior minister to strip noncitizen terrorists or their families of their Israeli residency rights. A parallel military order allows the army’s Civil Administration to expel terrorists or their families from Israeli-controlled to Palestinian-Authority-controlled areas of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>But coalition sources explained that this is possible largely because the law granting the minister this power was enacted prior to the 1992 Basic Law on Human Dignity and Liberty. Since the Basic Law contains a grandfather clause, protecting preexisting legislation from judicial review, the High Court of Justice can’t overturn the existing law on the grounds that it contradicts the Basic Law, as it could with any legislation passed after 1992.</p> \n<p>But a new law would almost certainly face High Court scrutiny and might well be overturned.</p> \n<p>The current bill has 16 sponsors, including Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz, coalition chairman David Bitan (Likud), Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid and two former heads of the Shin Bet security service, MKs Jacob Perry (Yesh Atid) and Avi Dichter (Likud). Bitan decided to push the bill because he was seeking new tools with which to deter terrorists, especially the perpetrators of lone-wolf attacks, which are more difficult for the security services to prevent.</p> \n<p>The bill would allow any person who committed an act of terror, or any relatives who “participated in committing the act by knowing about, abetting, encouraging or supporting the act before, during or after its commission,” to be deported to the PA. Such a person could be deported even without having been convicted, though he or she would have the right to argue against the expulsion at a hearing.</p> \n<p>In October, the coalition began to put forward a separate, government bill that would greatly expand the defense minister’s authority to detain Israeli citizens suspected of involvement in terror without trial or issue restraining orders against them. This bill, which was passed in its first reading in the Knesset and sent back to committee for changes prior to its second and third readings, would grant the minister far broader and more vaguely defined powers than he has today.</p> \n<p>Among other provisions, this bill would allow the minister to impose restrictions on a person’s occupation or place of employment, forbid him to enter or leave certain parts of the country, bar him from leaving the country, prevent him from making contact with certain individuals, or impose “any other order or restriction required for reasons of national security or the public safety.”</p> \n<p>Current law, in contrast, allows the minister to issue a much narrower range of restrictive orders.</p> \n<p>The Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee is slated to start discussing this bill next week.</p>",

But we survived.</p> \n<p>Inbar: Next time we go El Al.</p> \n<p>Raz: El Al is appalling, too, but at least there’s leg room. On the flight out there was a woman on drugs who was in a state of paranoia, completely wacko. I think she was on Ecsta. She kept bugging her son, then calmed down, then bugged him again, and made our seats shake.</p> \n<p>Inbar: And the flight attendants weren’t nice.</p> \n<p>Was Amsterdam nice, at least?</p> \n<p>Raz: It is a fabulous city. We spent five days there.</p> \n<p>Inbar: It was Christmas and everything was totally decorated.</p> \n<p>Raz: We complained about why there aren’t any decorations here on holidays, why no trees with lights.</p> \n<p>So they don’t catch fire from the Hanukkah menorahs, I guess. What did you do there?</p> \n<p>Raz: We did all the most touristy things there are.</p> \n<p>Inbar: Except for taking a picture with the “I amsterdam” monument.</p> \n<p>How long have you known each other?</p> \n<p>Raz: Just two years, even though we’re both from Ramat Aviv.</p> \n<p>What was the excuse for your trip?</p> \n<p>Raz: It’s because Inbar is entering the army. She wanted a grand finale beforehand, and I leaped at the idea.</p> \n<p>Where will you be serving?</p> \n<p>Inbar: I will be an education noncom. That wasn’t the original plan, but I’m okay with it. There’s a three-month course.</p> \n<p>Raz: I don’t know yet. My draft date is only in July, so I’m still in the classification phases, but my expectation is for combat service.</p> \n<p>Combat, wow.</p> \n<p>Raz: For us it’s clear; it’s an instinctive reaction.</p> \n<p>Being in a combat unit doesn’t scare you?</p> \n<p>Raz: It does a little because it’s something I don’t know, but it’ll be terrific.</p> \n<p>And just being drafted by itself doesn’t scare you?</p> \n<p>Inbar: I’m not doing frontline service, so there’s nothing for me to be scared of.</p> \n<p>Have you thought about what you’ll do after the army? Do you have plans for life?</p> \n<p>Raz (to Inbar): You must know.</p> \n<p>Inbar: She wants to study medicine.</p> \n<p>Raz (smiling): Yes, that’s true. I would have been really disappointed if she hadn’t known.</p> \n<p>Inbar, what about you?</p> \n<p>Inbar: I don’t run too far, because I don’t like developing expectations and then being disappointed. First you finish one thing and then you go on. That’s the smartest way.</p> \n<p>Raz: I’m the exact opposite of her. I love to dream and I have absolutely no patience, and for me everything has to happen here and now, even if it tramples other things. Now, now!</p> \n<p>Are either of you already thinking about a family, children?</p> \n<p>Raz: No, we’re not occupied with that stuff yet. We talk about makeup, about army, about clothes, about boys – everything having to do with women.</p> \n<p>Inbar: The first thing is to finish the army, do the psychometric test [for university admission], and then we’ll see where to flow from there. It’s important for me to go by the book.</p> \n<p>Raz: Oy, I just read a great book on the flight.</p> \n<p>What book?</p> \n<p>Raz: “Wild,” by Cheryl Strayed. An amazing book. I haven’t finished it yet, but I almost cried on the plane.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Didn’t it make you feel like wanting to drop everything and go backpacking?</p> \n<p>Raz: I will never leave Tel Aviv, not for anything. I don’t see myself living anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Inbar: The whole time we talked about how great it would be getting back to Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Raz: I won’t live in any other city in Israel, either.</p> \n<p>Inbar: At most, I’m willing to move to Herzliya. We call it “the quiet Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>Raz: It has a pretense of being Tel Aviv, but it’s not the same really.</p> \n<p>Inbar: Yallah, we have to go now. Mom’s here.</p> \n<p>Oshri Hertz, 41, left, from Kfar Haim, and Hila Ginzburg, 39, from Haifa; flying to London</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask where you’re going?</p> \n<p>Hila: The headline of our trip is, “Christmas lights.”</p> \n<p>Oshri: We’re going so we can see a real Christmas. We earned this trip honestly, because we bust our butts: career, home, family, children, laundry, cooking, driving the kids to after-school groups.</p> \n<p>Hila: Okay, maybe I’d leave out the cooking. Otherwise, my husband will read this and say it’s not credible. Anyway, it all started last Saturday. We went to Oshri and Nir’s place to pick satsumas.</p> \n<p>Oshri: A type of tangerine.</p> \n<p>Hila: They have a small orchard. When we finished picking, Oshri cooked, and suddenly we realized that our next trip to Rome was scheduled for March.</p> \n<p>Oshri: A long time!</p> \n<p>Hila: Right away we said, “How did we do this to ourselves?” The next thing you know, we bought tickets and began to panic ahead of the flight.</p> \n<p>Oshri: We’ll take a sip from the Rescue bottle [Rescue Remedy homeopathic stress reliever] right away and calm down.</p> \n<p>What will you do in London?</p> \n<p>Oshri: We have missions.</p> \n<p>Hila: I will taste whiskey for the first time. The truth is, I don’t know what to say. We’re regular folks, I don’t play pool, we didn’t even do drugs.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Oshri: Well, I have a Rescue bottle in my bag, for worries.</p> \n<p>Hila: Oof, we come off as boring.</p> \n<p>Give me a little of the Rescue. Not to worry. Where do you know each other from?</p> \n<p>Hila: We met in our first job, in the last millennium.

She just said it in a very small voice.</p> \n<p>Hila: That word makes the world move, and I didn’t say that, Freud did.

He had gone to use a bathroom at a nearby supermarket as the shelter lacked such facilities. The police waited there and arrested him again.</p> \n<p>The suspect spent the night in Hadarim Prison and was released on Saturday.</p> \n<p>During questioning the man confessed to the break-ins and said: “I live from one shelter to the next, every two days I look for a different shelter to sleep in. I have no home. Unfortunately, most of the time I eat from garbage cans, garbage rooms and in parking lots. I entered the kindergarten against my will.</p> \n<p>&quot;I entered through the door, took four muffins from the refrigerator, which you found on me today, a quarter of a loaf of bread and half a container of hummus, that’s what I ate today, and then I left the place.”</p> \n<p>Petah Tikva Magistrate’s Court Judge Oded Moreno ordered his release, writing in his decision:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“True, breaking into a building is serious At the same time, I believe that this is a case of ‘Les Miserables’ - a book that became an indictment against society’s attitude towards the weak.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Since the court believes that this is really an exceptional case, I found no reason to extend the suspect’s detention since I don’t believe that the suspect can interfere with investigative activities.”</p> \n<p>Attorney Amit Ferrante of the Public Defender’s Office said his client was “being persecuted, it’s bizarre to detain a young homeless man although they knew from the start that he stole only cookies and did no damage.</p> \n<p>&quot;Why ‘conspiracy to commit a crime’? This is a person who should be helped, not arrested.”</p> \n<p>Another public defender, Attorney Mohammed Raad added:&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“After meeting with the client I discovered the sad picture - they forgot that the shelter has no bathroom, and he forgot to tell the judge that that’s why he went to the nearby supermarket.

        "text":["<p>This year has been a difficult one for pharmaceutical stocks. Once drug pricing became a hot subject in the U.S. presidential campaign, very little good followed in an industry that was enjoying record-high share prices just over a year ago.</p> \n<p>The politicians directed most of their wrath at specific companies, but repeated statements on the hustings from Democratic Party candidates about reining in drug price inflation after the election had its effect on many other drug manufacturers as well.</p> \n<p>Against such a dismal backdrop, the performance of Foamix Pharmaceuticals – which develops foam-based drugs to treat skin diseases – is a notable standout. Foamix shares have outperformed the Nasdaq’s biotechnology index by 55% since the beginning of 2016, and risen by 66% since the company’s initial public offering in September 2014.</p> \n<p>The Rehovot-based firm, which has a market capitalization of $390 million, raised a combined $172 million in three public offerings – including $57 million in September.</p> \n<p>One possible explanation for the company’s performance and its ability to raise so much capital even though it has just 60 employees, is its combination of proven technology, a pipeline of products in relatively advanced stages of development, and cooperative ties with large companies. This is expected to generate a stable revenue stream for Foamix, beginning in 2019.</p> \n<p>“Both of us have been intensively involved for many years in the dermatology sector, which is a field with relatively little innovation,” says Dov Tamarkin, Foamix’s CEO, who founded the company with Meir Eini in 2003. “We looked for an idea that would allow us to establish a big business, and then we happened upon creating a preparation using foam,” he added.</p> \n<p>Not the first, but fast</p> \n<p>Eini and Tamarkin weren’t the first to hit on the idea. Connetics, which preceded them, took two steroid ointments – one for the treatment of allergic skin reactions and another for inflamed scalp, which had been selling for $10 a tube – and turned them into a foam that initially sold for $200 per package. In 2006, three years after Foamix was founded, Connetics was sold to Stiefel Laboratories for $640 million.</p> \n<p>But even if they weren’t the first, Eini and Tamarkin acted quickly, entering the field early and creating a measure of protection from future competition. “We weren’t the first in the field, but we created something unique,” explained Tamarkin.</p> \n<p>The advantage of foam over ointments, creams and gels or oral medications for treating skin conditions is that it’s absorbed more rapidly and can cover a large area of the body. And it doesn’t penetrate beyond the layer at which most skin diseases are present and then enter the bloodstream. Side effects are, therefore, relatively minimal and the foam can reach areas that are difficult to access with other medications, including intimate areas of a woman’s body.</p> \n<p>Foamix’s technology includes nine sub-technologies with foams based, for example, on creams, ointments and oils, and the range enables the company to develop products for various parts of the body and broaden its market potential.</p> \n<p>The company’s business strategy involves not giving the world’s major pharmaceutical firms any incentive to develop their own expertise in foam. Rather than wait for them to emerge as competitors, Foamix has instead signed cooperation agreements with many of the industry’s giants, including Bayer, Mylan and Allergan pertaining to product-life cycle management – meaning extending the period during which a product is protected by patent from generics.</p> \n<p>Foamix’s most advanced relationship – involving a product that has been approved and is being offered for sale – is with Bayer: Foamix developed a foam form of Finacea, a drug for the treatment of inflammation due to rosacea, a skin disease that generally appears around the age of 30 and most often with women.</p> \n<p>The product was developed jointly by the companies using Foamix technology, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and is protected by patent until 2029. The collaboration extended Bayer’s exclusivity on its biggest dermatology drug by an entire decade, and it is making every effort to get patients to switch to the foam.</p> \n<p>Despite the success of the strategy of developing technology and then making it available to other drug companies for a fee and royalties, Foamix is now pursuing a second course.</p> \n<p>“The model worked nicely and we even made money, but we understood that our strategy needed to be more daring,” said Tamarkin. “We came to the conclusion that we could develop a drug and take it all the way to market.”</p> \n<p>The trigger for the turnabout was a technological breakthrough: a foam version of Solodyn, which is the leading product for the treatment of acne, with annual sales of $567 million. The reason it’s such an interesting business opportunity, said Tamarkin, is that Solodyn has to be taken orally for 12 to 16 weeks for the treatment of moderate to severe acne. But the drug is an antibiotic, and the general rule is not to take antibiotics for an extended period – to avoid side effects and resistance by bacteria.</p> \n<p>Phase II clinical trials of Foamix’s generic foam version of Solodyn (FMX-101) achieved a 66% to 72% reduction in the number of acne sores after 12 weeks of treatment, compared with 50% in a group that received a placebo. There were also two degrees or more of improvement based on an accepted medical scale among 20% to 34% of patients, compared with 14% who received a placebo. Phase III clinical trials are expected to conclude at the end of 2017. If successful, they would enable the company to enter the market of 10 million Americans suffering from moderate to severe acne.</p> \n<p>The second product Foamix has been aiming to bring to market by itself is FMX-103, a foam whose active ingredient is minocycline. That’s the same ingredient as in Solodyn, but at a different concentration. It’s designed for patients with moderate to severe rosacea, which causes redness to the face. Phase II trials of the product ended in September, with good results.</p> \n<p>Rosacea affects 16 million Americans alone, and the market for medication to treat it is considered particularly concentrated: It’s 80% controlled by Galderma, with annual sales of $650 million from four products; Bayer has the remaining 20%.</p> \n<p>Foamix as takeover target</p> \n<p>Consolidation in the global drug industry has been particularly severe in the market for skin diseases, which has led to firings and experienced managers looking for work. That in turn has made it easier for Foamix to attract personnel to set up its own sales and marketing operation, in support of its business strategy to go it alone.</p> \n<p>“Part of the uniqueness of Foamix as a startup is the combination of development facilities in Israel and a group in the United States, and their members have the ability to take a product that has been proven to work and be effective, and take it all the way to the FDA and to market in an organized manner,” said Tamarkin.</p> \n<p>“The cost of a salesperson is $200,000 to $250,000 a year. These are not very expensive staff and they live on commissions, so we think we can meet the goal we have set for ourselves to be a specialty pharma company specializing in one area of treatment with a focus on the United States,” he added.</p> \n<p>Companies like Foamix are frequently targeted for takeover: does that fate await the firm in 2019 or 2020?</p> \n<p>Pharmaceutical analyst Louise Chen, from Guggenheim Securities, expects that the product Foamix has in its most advanced stage in the pipeline, FMX-101 (for the treatment of acne), could generate revenues of $170 million in 2021 and $500 million annually at its peak. When it comes to FMX-103, for rosacea, she says it could generate revenues of $30 million in 2021.</p> \n<p>Chen set a $20 target price for Foamix shares for the next 12 months, reflecting a market cap that, at $730 million, is double its current market valuation. The shares closed at $10.91 on Friday.</p> \n<p>Analyst Ken Cacciatore at Cowen &amp; Co., meanwhile, thinks FMX-101 could ultimately achieve sales of $500 million, pointing to two comparable drugs, Allergan’s Aczone and Galderma’s Epiduo, which have $400 million in annual sales. He says FMX-101 will be found to be better than the two others. Also, it will provide an alternative to oral antibiotics that affect the entire body, with the attendant potential to develop resistance rather than solving the particular skin problem, Cacciatore added.</p> \n<p>If Foamix’s two leading products do meet expectations, Foamix will become a takeover target and be trading at closer to $1 billion in market capitalization, even if Tamarkin continues to talk about growing the company.</p> \n<p>Four months ago, Foamix shares jumped 10% on the day it released favorable clinical trial results for its rosacea drug. Three months before that, GSK sold its foam medication portfolio for the relatively small sum of $50 million to the Mayne Pharma Group of Australia. It included the foams that had initially been developed by Connetics, but which had lost a substantial part of their value when Perrigo developed generic versions.</p> \n<p>Perrigo was able to attack the patents on the original drugs, and GSK and Perrigo then reached a settlement that allowed Perrigo to market its version in 2013.</p> \n<p>And the fact that Foamix’s innovation is a new delivery system for an existing molecule may lead other companies to believe that Foamix’s patent protection is not an insurmountable obstacle, attempting to do what Perrigo did to Connetics.</p> \n<p>Tamarkin rejects the comparison with Connetics, saying that, among other differences, Connetics had developed foam versions of ointments, while minocycline – the active ingredient in two Foamix products – is currently administered orally.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Finally, a smoking gun has been found. Clearly, Breaking the Silence – which collects testimony from Israeli soldiers about their service in the territories – isn’t just a multifaceted organization of traitors, but an organization that boldly lies to millions of Israelis and billions of antagonistic outsiders.</p> \n<p>The “gun” is a group of reserve soldiers who took a stance and courageously said that the organization’s spokesman and their former comrade in arms, Dean Issacharoff, made up a story about abusing a Palestinian prisoner.</p> \n<p>“You’re lying,” they charge, using much the same tone and gestures as that “You’re fired!” man who fooled America all the way from a reality TV show to the most important role in the world.</p> \n<p>If Issacharoff is unabashedly lying, just imagine the lies in anonymous testimonies, warns the video by the Reservists on Duty group.</p> \n<p>The group’s message is clear: Members of Breaking the Silence aren’t just enemies of Israel; they’re also accomplished liars.</p> \n<p>This has caused an internet meltdown. The proof of the “deceit” has been watched hundreds of thousands of times and shared tens of thousands of times by people simultaneously shocked and delighted. One can almost imagine ill-wishers convening on a summer’s eve atop the ruins of a Palestinian village and deciding to invent tall tales about Israeli soldiers.</p> \n<p>Many on the right feel this is the biggest, most important battle over patriotism: Not only is this a battle against the spreading of testimony overseas; it is denial of the content itself. Because if any of it is true, one might dare suggest it should be heard. But if it’s all lies, it should be eradicated. “Investigate,” as the video commands.</p> \n<p>This battle is typical of the denial the Israeli public so badly wants – and is the very justification for the existence of Breaking the Silence.</p> \n<p>Here is a spoiler, in case you never set foot in the occupied territories: Even if somebody inflated his story, and their colleague was an innocent soldier who took things out of context, Breaking the Silence is telling the truth. That group’s video does not prove it is lying about anything. And for every story brought to Breaking the Silence, there are innumerable ones that don’t reach it.</p> \n<p>Few who served in the territories saw or heard nothing. For many, incidents of this nature were part of the daily routine, not a thing they should think or talk about. It’s just there. It’s part of the experience. Not something anybody would even bother mentioning over dinner.</p> \n<p>I never gave a testimony to Breaking the Silence; I even rejected the request to verify testimonies by my friends. But I saw dozens of instances that were as bad, or not, as the case described by Issacharoff. From harassing the elderly, to holding people up at checkpoints for hours for no particular reason, to slaps here and looting there, to shooting unjustifiably, to terrifying children in the middle of the night. And to Yair Lapid, who told a web user named Ido that “In a case like that, it is very important to report it to your commanders so they can take action,” I can state that in the few cases I did make a report, nothing was done.</p> \n<p>It isn’t the politicians exploiting this video to score “I love Israel” points who scare me. What’s scary is the thousands of Israelis who can look in the mirror and deny everything without blinking; who declare their certainty without even checking the facts. These are people who tell you one day about a Palestinian being beaten up, and the next day claim Breaking the Silence is lying.</p> \n<p>I never testified before Breaking the Silence. But for all my discomfort at the path the group is taking, for all my reservations, next time I think I will, without hesitating. Because in the face of a shameless lie, and the attempt to blind the eyes of the willfully sightless even more, what matters is not only knowing the truth, but stating it.</p> \n<p>The more the testimony deniers grow, and declaimers of the “most moral army in the world” multiply, the clearer the importance of Breaking the Silence’s primary goal: to tell Israelis what is being done in their name.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Knesset passed on Wednesday a preliminary reading of the independent nation-state bill submitted by MK Avi Dichter. The bill will be put on hold for two months during which the government will sponsor a replacement bill.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;controversial bill&nbsp;enshrines Israel's status as “the national home of the Jewish people,” and that “the right to realize self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” It also revokes Arabic's &quot;official language&quot; status in Israel.</p> \n<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked said on Wednesday that the bill is meant to make judges consider Israel’s Jewish character in an equal manner to its democratic character in rulings where the two values clash.</p> \n<p>“We have a wonderful but very activist court,” Shaked said. “In the 20 years since we enacted the law on human dignity and freedom we've seen a court system that gives more weight to democratic values over Jewish values. The nation-state bill that came up this week will make the presence of Jewish values felt as a tool for judges.”</p> \n<p>Shaked’s comments seem to contradict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks on the bill this week. Netanyahu said the government’s bill would enshrine “the fact that Israel is the nation-state for the Jewish people in their historical homeland.” He added, “It also enshrines into Israeli law our flag, our anthem and Jerusalem being our eternal capital.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu did not address controversial clauses in versions of the bill submitted by the right in past years, chief among them the demand to legally subordinate democracy to the state’s Jewish character. Officials from the prime minister's Likud Party said this week that Netanyahu’s ignoring these fundamentals indicates that he will not include them in the government’s bill to be presented in two months.</p> \n<p>The nation-state law refers to two different bills the right has pushed in recent years. First, Netanyahu called on enacting a law in Israel that would demand the Palestinians recognize Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, MKs from Habayit Hayehudi and the hawkish wing of the Likud have advanced a formula invoking preference for Israel’s Jewish character over its democratic character. Dichter’s private-members' bill includes a host of clauses to enshrine the status of Judaism in the state and to lower the status of other religions. However, the clause about subordinating democracy to Judaism was struck from it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli students underperformed yet again on international exams, according to the results of the 2015 PISA assessment test, released Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Israeli students scored below the OECD average in math, science and reading, and even underscored some developing nations as well.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the gaps between Israeli students themselves were the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which includes 34 socioeconomically advanced countries, and among the highest in the entire world. Some 20% of Israeli students failed all three tests – in math, science and reading. The figure was 45% for Arab students, versus 12% for Jewish students.</p> \n<p>Some 540,000 15-year-olds in 72 different countries took the test, which was conducted by the OECD. They are considered a representative sample of the 29 million 15-year-olds in these countries.</p> \n<p>In Israel, some 6,598 students from 173 schools took the test. This is considered a representative sample of Israel’s students, with the exception of ultra-Orthodox boys.</p> \n<p>Israel’s worst performing students – those in the 5th percentile or below – scored the worst out of all OECD nations, and were among the lowest scores in the world. Even the highest scoring students in Israel did not do well compared to their international counterparts.</p> \n<p>The results from last year’s test, during Shay Piron’s term as education minister, are not much different than the results from the previous test in 2012. This indicates the trend of slowly improving test scores that began in 2006 may have halted.</p> \n<p>Goal set decade ago not achieved</p> \n<p>Israel had set a goal of significantly improving students’ performance over the past 10 years.</p> \n<p>The PISA tests are held every three years and are considered the most thorough and important measure of student performance internationally. While the TIMSS test, whose results were published last week, test knowledge of math and science, the PISA tests students’ abilities and skills, and not necessarily book knowledge. The tests seek to show whether the students have the intellectual potential to join a modern workforce.</p> \n<p>Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug recently stated that the poor performance of Israel’s students, and the high gaps among them, is likely to damage the country’s economic growth. “We’re not giving students tools and skills to enable them to succeed in the workforce, and that will impact future growth and inequality. Israel’s education system is not creating equal opportunity,” she said at the Sderot conference last week.</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett stated that the test results “emphasize the need for reducing gaps in Israel’s education and indicate that significant improvement is needed.” He noted that the test scores predate his term, and noted his plan to increase the number of high schoolers taking five points of math in the matriculation test – the highest level of high-school math – and to improve teaching.</p> \n<p>“The results of the Meitzav [standardized test] published last month indicate that for the first time, gaps are decreasing, but the road before us is still long,” he said.</p> \n<p>Despite the extra 15 billion shekels (about $4 billion) budgeted to education in the three years between the 2012 test and the 2015 test – an increase of 35% in nominal terms – students’ performance has not improved.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the annual education budget has more than doubled in the past 10 years, even though scores have not changed measurably over that period. In 2006 the annual education budget was 25 billion shekels, while it now stands at 53 billion shekels, and is expected to reach 60 billion shekels.</p> \n<p>Little improvement in math, science</p> \n<p>From 2006 through 2015, Israeli scores in science increased by only 13 points, from 454 to 467 out of a total possible 600 points. The average Israeli math score increased by 28 points, from 442 to 470 points. The score in reading increased more significantly, by 40 points, from 439 to 479 points.</p> \n<p>In all subjects, the average Israeli score was lower than the average from developed countries and also from some developing countries.</p> \n<p>Israel started participating in international tests at the end of the 1990s, and the low scores shocked the country. Since then, aside from a committee appointed under then-education minister Limor Livnat, whose recommendations were never fully implemented, no education minister has taken fundamental measures to improve the education system.</p> \n<p>Formerly, Israel had one of the lowest investments per student in the OECD, but the increased budget brings it closer to the average. However, the state will need to invest more – and use the money correctly – to improve students’ performance.</p> \n<p>Education Ministry data show a direct correlation between investment per student and international test scores, but money in and of itself is not enough. The three highest performing countries, for instance, are Singapore, Japan and Estonia, and each invests less per student than the OECD average. Japan actually invests less than Israel.</p> \n<p>Some 20% of Israeli students failed in all three tests – math, science and reading, compared to the OECD average of 13%. The OECD states that a student who fails one or more test is likely to have difficulty participating in a modern workforce.</p> \n<p>Of the OECD nations, only Slovakia, Greece, Chile, Turkey and Mexico had a higher percentage of students failing all three tests.</p> \n<p>Some 3% of Israeli students received excellent test scores, compared to an OECD average of 4%.</p> \n<p>Israel had one of the highest math failure rates in the OECD – 32% versus the OECD average of 23%. Some 31% of Israeli students failed the science test, versus the 21% average, and 27% failed the reading test, versus 20% in the OECD as a whole.</p> \n<p>Some good news for Jews, none for Arabs</p> \n<p>The Education Ministry noted that in 2006, some 26% of Israeli students had failed all three tests. The decrease in the number of students who failed all tests was mostly due to improvements among Jewish students; there was no improvement in the performance of Arab students.</p> \n<p>Of the Arab students, 64% failed the math test and 56% failed the reading and science tests. Arab students receive on average considerably less money per student than Jewish students.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, Israel’s earnings gaps are among the highest in the developed world, and based on the test scores, this may even be worsening. While some 47% of students from a low socioeconomic background failed all three tests and 1% showed excellent results, only 18% of those from a high socioeconomic background failed all three exams, while 12% had outstanding achievements.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The order to report for reserves during Operation Protective Edge in 2014 caught Ohad Elhelo at a very inconvenient time.</p> \n<p>Just six months before, he had received a dream scholarship: a million shekels (about $280,000) to study for a bachelor’s degree in economics at Brandeis University in Boston. The scholarship is awarded once a year by the Abraham Fund to two students, a Jew and an Arab, with leadership potential and the ability to possibly influence the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. However, Elhelo’s plan to promote coexistence was forced to wait for the fighting to end.</p> \n<p>“I returned from Operation Protective Edge in despair,” Elhelo says, speaking by phone from his home in Boston. A Palestinian child doesn’t care whose missile hit his house, just that he has no house any more, he pointed out. But mainly he realized that salvation wasn’t going to come from politicians, because there is no leadership on either side.</p> \n<p>So he thought to create a meeting of minds that didn’t involve politicians.</p> \n<p>Elhelo began to lecture about the conflict and his insights from the battlefield, stressing the need for immediate change. Some of his lectures went viral, and in 2015 he took his idea to the next stage, setting up OGS: Our Generation Speaks, a startups incubator for Israelis and Palestinians.</p> \n<p>While some organizations try to bring different communities together, his concept was to build something together that would serve the communities afterwards, Elhelo explains.</p> \n<p>In no time Elhelo had built a team and pulled in investors, including Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots football team, and Aron Ain, CEO of Kronos. To date he’s raised $4 million for the project, which is also supported by Brandeis University and the international accelerator MassChallenge.</p> \n<p>Imad Telhami, CEO of Babcom Centers, which runs call centers, is on the OGS board. He explains why he joined. “When people get up in the morning and have a common project, they focus on each other’s strong points and on things they can get done together. The obstacles fall away. In my vision, peace will come from joint economic actions.”</p> \n<p>The incubator’s first “class” began a year ago. Out of 300 applications submitted by Israeli and Palestinian applicants, 70 passed the initial screening and were invited to interviews in Tel Aviv, Ramallah, Haifa, Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Finally 22 were selected. “The only candidates we did not meet face-to-face were the interviewees from Gaza. We had to make Skype calls,” says Elhelo.</p> \n<p>They have roughly equal numbers of Israelis and Palestinians, men and women; recently they decided that the team, board of directors, mentors and investors will be composed equally of Palestinians and Israelis.</p> \n<p>Each entrepreneur is given a mentor, usually the founder or CEO of a big company. OGS has a wrinkle rarely found among other accelerators and incubators: It will accept ideas still in the briefcase, as they say here, while most incubators will only let in existing companies.</p> \n<p>Elhelo, originally from Ashdod, runs the program jointly with Sinan Abu Shanab, originally from Bethlehem. They met in Boston in 2013, after Abu Shanab stayed in the city after was taking part in a student exchange program between Al Quds University and Brandeis.</p> \n<p>“I bring a Palestinian perspective to the venture,” he says.</p> \n<p>Going after Bedouin genetic disease</p> \n<p>The first round of OGS resulted in three projects. The first is a non-profit organization called Genesis, a social-technological enterprise to solve the problem of genetic diseases in the Bedouin population in Israel’s south. The project, established by seven of the 22 participants in the round, had three people on board, a Bedouin and two Jewish women (one observant, one secular).</p> \n<p>It is reasonable to assume that, like the meeting between Elhelo and Abu Shanab, the initiators of the project – Yasmeen Abu-Fraiha, Maria Deichel and Naomi Avraham, wouldn’t have met otherwise.</p> \n<p>The rate of hereditary disease in Israel’s Bedouin is 10 times greater than that of the general population. Abu-Fraiha, a doctor at Soroka hospital in Be’er Sheva, was the project’s initiator. Hereditary disease because of inbreeding is also common in Gaza and the West Bank, she says.</p> \n<p>The Israeli Health Ministry provides some genetic tests for married couples, but they’re not mandatory and the Bedouins tend not to do them, whether because of floating mistrust or inaccessibility, though over 100 genetic diseases are known among the Negev population. “95% of Bedouin women who do these tests do so only after a sick child is born,” says Abu-Fraiha. “We want to prevent them from having that first sick child.”</p> \n<p>How? By having them go to schools, mosques and community centers, offering the tests there, and building a genetic database for the Bedouin.</p> \n<p>Another incubator startup, operating out of Ramallah, is Qual.IT, which supplies software quality testing for Israeli companies. This has seven partners: two Israelis, two Israeli Arabs and three Palestinians, one from Gaza. The venture has exactly one customer so far. The hope is to use the Israeli marketplace as a springboard to the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>What’s it like to work with Israelis? “It’s a life-changer,” says the Gazan, Mahmoud, who declines to disclose his surname. “It was tough for me at first, because the only thing I knew about you is army uniforms. I didn’t know a thing about life and culture in Israel and am sure you don’t know about ours. Gradually we got to know one another and we realized that this program is a key to change. Maybe we can’t resolve the conflict now, but if more and more Israelis and Palestinians get to know one another, we’ll make it.”</p> \n<p>A third incubator venture is Mvpeer, with six parents – three Israelis and three Palestinians. The company has four employees, of whom two are founders. The development team is in Ramallah and the company is run from Jerusalem. The company supplies MVP (minimum viable product) to young startups – which in English means it helps them develop their first products.</p> \n<p>The West Bank has plenty of computer science grads and programmers, but unemployment is over 40%, says Daniel Shoshani, a partner in Mvpeer. He too attests that when it comes to business, the conflict vanishes: “When an Israeli entrepreneur talks with a Palestinian development manager, a new way for the two peoples to meet is created. We believe Ramallah could become a little Tel Aviv. Connecting the Palestinians to Startup Nation could be a terrific growth driver.”</p>",

Highlights --&nbsp;“Did you guys hear how Barbra Streisand is blaming her weight gain on Trump? Stop laughing! I am too. It’s like I am pregnant with this baby, Rosemary’s baby. I do not know what to do about this. I cannot stop eating and drinking since this man got elected I should also tell you I am Ashkenazi Jewish — and Sephardic. And I am also the descendant of slaves, and Hispanic. So basically, Donald Trump has offended all of me, every single part of me. &quot;&nbsp;  The one good thing about Trump:&nbsp;“I think he has been supportive of Israel’s right to exist. I am not sure he can find Israel on the map. I am not sure he doesn’t think it’s a deli in the Bronx... Other than liking matzah — in the same way he likes taco bowls — Donald Trump does understand that Israel has the right to exist, and that is – in my eyes – one of his few saving graces.”  On Jared’s Middle East portfolio:&nbsp;“I am not sure how much Jared understands [about the Middle East], but, you know, he’s got a lot on his plate. Keeping Ivanka happy can’t be easy. Getting his family out of financial straits can’t be easy either.”&nbsp;  On Steve Bannon:&nbsp;“They keep saying that Jared and Ivanka are Jewish, so, you know, Trump is good because his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. Well, go to them. I mean, surely you’ve got friends who know these people. Um. Hell, even I have friends who know these people. That’s why I am not deported yet – yet.” [JewishInsider]&nbsp;  FBI Director James Comey discussed the Holocaust in a speech at&nbsp;the ADL conference -- by Aaron Magid:&nbsp;“Although the slaughter of the Holocaust was led by sick and evil people, those sick and evil leaders were joined by and followed by people who loved their families, took soup to sick neighbors, who went to Church, who gave to charity. Good people helped murder millions I believe the Holocaust is the most significant event in human history. How could such a thing happen? How is that consistent in any way with the concept of a loving God? The answer for me is, I don’t know.” [JewishInsider]&nbsp;  Abe Foxman tells us... “Comey understands what most people fail to comprehend about the Shoa - that six million Jews perished because 'the good people' implemented Hitler's Final Solution. Germans and their accomplices, who loved their families and dogs, and religiously went to Church on Sunday, systematically murdered Jews because of anti-Semitic hatred preached and practiced for hundreds of years Comey says he doesn't know why. We do know why! Hate has consequences; it infects and eventually kills. That is the price of prejudice and the Shoa was the price of anti-Semitic prejudice which is still alive today.”  Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Simon Wiesenthal Center: &quot;I understand what Director Comey wanted to say. But to be clear, any German who participated in or abetted in any way Hitler’s Final Solution could no longer be considered “good people.” By their words and deeds abetting genocide, they voided anything “good” they had previously done.&quot;&nbsp;  TOP TALKER: “Washington Loves General McMaster, But Trump Doesn't” by Eli Lake:&nbsp;“In recent weeks, Trump has privately expressed regret for choosing McMaster.

Steve and I and a few others at the company had an idea for the future of the music business and spent a year of our lives doing the banking work and analysis for the purchase of Warner Music [from Time Warner] by private equity firms. A dozen private equity firms told us our numbers were fantasy, but a group agreed with us and bought Warner Music for $2.6 billion. Then when Edgar Bronfman was brought in late as executive chairman, we decided not to go ahead because we didn’t believe in his vision, but our analysis of how to finance and purchase the company was highly accurate and it allowed the buyers to make hundreds of millions of dollars, and in the process Steve and I made millions of dollars for putting together the deal.&quot; [HollywoodReporter]&nbsp;  &quot;Kushner emerged as conduit for Canada on NAFTA talks&quot;&nbsp;by Julie Pace and Catherine Lucey:&nbsp;&quot;According to a White House official, aides to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called [Jared] Kushner urgently on April 26 after seeing news reports that Trump was considering signing an executive order withdrawing from NAFTA...

Mast, who personally volunteered in the Israeli military after losing both of his legs while serving in Afghanistan, emphasized the bipartisan nature of this legislation. “This bipartisan legislation would expedite the development of the Arrow 3 long-range missile defense system, which is absolutely critical to Israel’s defense and stability in the Middle East,” he noted. The measure calls for an increase of $105 million to Israel for fiscal year 2018 to fund the program. [JewishInsider]&nbsp;  “Progressives Need a New Foreign Policy Vision. This Democratic Senator Says He Has One” by Eric Levitz:&nbsp;“One foreign policy issue that Democratic voters have strong — and often, diametrically opposed — views on is the Israel-Palestine conflict. Polls show that younger progressives are much more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than their elders. And many such voters, along with pro-Israel, anti-occupation groups like J Street, believe that the United States should do more to discourage Israeli settlement expansion, and bring an end to the occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza. Do you agree?  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT): “I think that conflict is very hard to resolve given the existing leadership on both sides of the divide. The United States has always had a tricky position. We have to stand by Israel as a sacred friend in that region, but we also know historically that no deals get done unless the United States isn’t willing to tell some hard truths to Tel Aviv. The settlement construction under Netanyahu did make peace less likely because it ultimately carved out sections of a future Palestinian state in a way that wasn’t constructive. I think, I’m a believer in supporting Israel, but also in not being afraid to call them out, when they’re doing something that isn’t ultimately good for peace. I think you can walk that line. I don’t support those that the only way you are a friend to Israel is to support whatever the existing government asks you to support.”” [NYMag]&nbsp;  --Worth noting: Sen Murphy says &quot;to tell some hard truths to Tel Aviv&quot; and not Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>** Good Tuesday Morning!

What changed? “I think when technology happened, that Google, Facebook, these companies have as much of a mission as other organisations,” she says Rumours were fuelled when Mark Zuckerberg&nbsp;embarked on a US tour to meet community groups, churches and businesses that appeared remarkably similar to an election campaign trail.

Kennedy Profile in Courage award to former President Barack Obama When asked about his plans for the future on Today—particularly in regards to one day seeking public office—he was non-committal But he also left the door wide open and swinging on its hinges: “I’m inspired by my family’s legacy of public service.

She hasn’t lost yet&quot; by&nbsp;William Finnegan:&nbsp;&quot;Ahmad had a multifaceted upbringing. She grew up in suburban Nassau County, Long Island, with her father and stepmother and two younger brothers, and she also lived part time with her mother, in Manhattan. Her parents had divorced, amicably, when she was an infant, and, as Zainab grew, according to her father, Naeem, “she would play Mom off against Dad, but always for one thing—to buy more books.” “We felt comfortable here,” Naeem told me, when I visited him and his wife, Nasrin, at their home, in East Meadow. “I felt comfortable with my neighbors, and never told my children to avoid kids because they’re Christian, Jewish—none of that.” (Most of Zainab’s friends as a child were Jewish.)

Ms. Heller, who uses profanity when ranting and raving, kept her promise to Mr. Bronfman that she would sanitize her speech. She drew chuckles from the two dozen guests when she referred with irony to the president’s “excellent” policies, and when she threatened to steal a Chagall mounted on the wall. “We made a lot of money,” she said afterward, declining to say how much. But all the attention has helped triple the IRAP budget this year, to $6.5 million, she said. During a summer in Israel, Ms. Heller quit an internship and traveled to Jordan, where she met Iraqi refugees stuck in a state of limbo that appalled her. After finagling meetings with the United Nations refugee agency and the United States Embassy so she could better understand the resettlement process, she returned to Yale and, with another student, founded IRAP — the “I” then standing for Iraqi.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  TALK OF OUR NATION: “It took a century to create the weekend—and only a decade to undo it” by Katrina Onstad:&nbsp;&quot;The state of the weekend is an ongoing battle in Israel, where the official weekend is the day and a half that constitutes the Sabbath, from Friday evening through Saturday. But Israel’s weekend is changing, too—tensely. Some Orthodox Jews, appalled at Sabbath-breakers, have reportedly thrown stones at Israelis taking the bus on Saturdays. With Arabs and Christians to please, there have been calls for a full, two-day Friday-Saturday weekend to accommodate holy days for all groups.&quot; [Quartz]&nbsp;  “Why was this Passover different from all other Passovers?” by Susan Abeles:&nbsp;“I was punished, and effectively forced out of my job of over 26 years, because I observed Passover. So I'm going to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear my case As I made in my case, each year during my 26 years at the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), I submitted a list of all Jewish holidays on which I would take leave that year, a procedure that was always accepted by my different supervisors In 2013, I followed the same protocol as I had for decades... Then the MWAA placed me on AWOL for the last two days of Passover for violating leave policy and suspended me in May for an additional five days without pay with an added-on insubordination charge for using my own vacation time to worship God.” [TheHill]&nbsp;  TRANSITION: Jonathan Schulman has been hired as AIPAC's National Synagogue Initiative Director.

        "text":["<p>Prof. Richard Horton is a dignified man who holds one of the top jobs in the world of science:&nbsp;editor-in-chief of renowned British medical journal The Lancet. But when he shows a picture of a poster he received in 2014 – with his face alongside those of Nazi war criminals and terrorists – his elegance and serenity are replaced by genuine emotional distress.</p> \n<p>“It was pretty painful,” recounts Horton, 56. “We lived in London, where my daughter goes to a school where there’s a strong Jewish community. We had parents coming into our house – I wasn’t there – and shouting at my wife, accusing her of being anti-Semitic because of me. My daughter would come home from school saying to me, ‘Dad, why do you hate Jews?’ She was 14 then. It was getting crazy. The irony is that my wife’s father is Jewish, and his mother escaped from Russia during the pogroms to Ellis Island. It was totally ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>The furor Horton is describing came after his journal published “An Open Letter for the People of Gaza” during the war between Israel and Hamas in the summer of 2014. In the letter, 24 physicians from Italy, Britain and Norway came out against what they labeled Israel’s war crimes, calling upon the world “to take a stand” and warning that if not, “We are also complicit in the destruction of the lives and homes of 1.8 million people in Gaza.”</p> \n<p>The letter noted that the “massacre in Gaza spares no one, and includes the disabled and sick in hospitals, children playing on the beach or on the roof top, with a large majority of non-combatants.”</p> \n<p>The Lancet not only published the letter but also offered readers the possibility of adding their signatures to it – which tens of thousands did.</p> \n<p>The extraordinary publication of the letter quickly became an ugly brawl between Israel’s supporters and its opponents, and to a certain extent backfired on the journal, which faced boycott threats and calls to fire Horton.</p> \n<p>But the story took a Hollywood movie-esque turn when Prof. Karl Skorecki, a doctor from Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, invited Horton to Israel, in an effort to let him form his own impressions about the Israeli health system, and to witness the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict up close.</p> \n<p>Earlier this month, nearly three years on, Horton was in Israel to present Israeli President Reuven Rivlin with a copy of a special edition of The Lancet, which is dedicated entirely to the Israeli health care system. He even delivered an impassioned speech about the Israeli health system during the presentation. The change in Horton’s stance could not have been more dramatic.</p> \n<p>How did all this happen? When Horton begins recounting his tale, it is evident the wounds are still open. He asks to begin “Right at the beginning” – that is, years before Operation Protective Edge in Gaza – when he first became acquainted with the Middle East.</p> \n<p>“I first came through Ben-Gurion airport in 2007 to go to Bethlehem. I was being encouraged by some people in the U.K. to write about Palestine and Israel,” he relates. “And I was very nervous about getting involved, because I didn’t know anything about it, and it seemed like political suicide. So I resisted and we didn’t do anything in The Lancet. But then I thought I should come, if we wanted to do something about it.”</p> \n<p>With time, Horton began to feel at home in the occupied territories, and the relationships he developed there grew stronger.</p> \n<p>He was taken on “a weeklong tour of villages around the West Bank and Gaza, met people in the health care system, and started to understand a little bit about their challenges. We decided to do a series about life in the territories. That took two years, and it was published in 2009. We decided to hold an annual meeting with young Palestinian researchers from the West Bank, Gaza and the Palestinian diaspora to present their research. This March, we held the eighth meeting, in Bir Zeit. There are such travel restrictions that not everybody could come. Sometimes we do it in Beirut, or Amman. We founded the Lancet Palestine Health Alliance. That was a wonderful collaboration – and then came Operation Protective Edge.”</p> \n<p>During the 2014 war, relates Horton, the reports coming in from the field caused him great distress. “The conflict started and I was seeing the number of deaths going up every day. I’ve been to Gaza, and I know how difficult it is there. The first thing that hits you when you go through the checkpoint is that it’s basically a land of children: all you see is children playing in the street. They have to have three shifts to go to school. I found myself getting really upset. I know that thousands of rockets were being sent from Gaza. But I got very emotional about Gaza. And then we got this letter sent from these people. We published it in July 2014.”</p> \n<p>What happened after you published the letter?</p> \n<p>“We got thousands of people signing up on our website to support the letter. But we also got people saying, ‘What are you doing? This is anti-Israel, anti-Semitic – you clearly hate Jews.’ I didn’t expect it, I didn’t see it coming. It wasn’t just from Israel, it was from everywhere, especially America. When we published some of the Palestinians’ abstracts in the past, we’d been criticized about balance, but nothing like this.”</p> \n<p>How harsh was it?</p> \n<p>“There were calls from the medical community in America, particularly the cardiology and diabetes communities, to boycott The Lancet. There were petitions going around to boycott us. A lot of American physicians signed the petition: They were not going to send research papers, review for us, write for us; they wouldn’t have anything to do with us. Not only that, they would not have anything to do with our publishers, Elsevier. They started writing letters to our publisher and me, calling for my dismissal.”</p> \n<p>Health is a political issue</p> \n<p>The moving spirits behind the letter were Dr. Paola Manduca and Dr. Swee Ang, who were subsequently revealed to have previously disseminated a neo-Nazi video and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. They denied the accusations. Against the 24 original signatories of their letter, 500 doctors – mostly Americans, some of them Nobel Prize laureates – countered and signed a letter stating their support for Israel and demanding that The Lancet retract.</p> \n<p>Did you really never think this might happen?</p> \n<p>“No. To me it was a humanitarian issue. There was an imbalance of firepower. Knowing Gazans, I knew they had no chance. I read reports about families that lost two or three members at a time. The letter was a cry of anguish from our readers about it. The result was massive polarization. The most serious charge is that we’re anti-Semites – there’s nothing worse than that.”</p> \n<p>Three weeks after publishing the letter, a battered and bruised Horton received an email from Prof. Skorecki, the director of medical and research development at Rambam and professor of medicine at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.</p> \n<p>“I thought, this is another letter accusing me. But it says: ‘I wish to invite you as a guest.’ I thought, doesn’t everybody in Israel hate me? What on earth is he doing inviting me to Rambam? He asked me to come and talk about my decision to publish the letter and learn about Rambam as an academic institution.”</p> \n<p>Did you think it might be a trap?</p> \n<p>Horton looks surprised by the question. “I didn’t even think about it. There was so much sincerity that I wanted to go. I do love the region. It was a fantastic opportunity. I wrote to Karl and said yes. I came in October 2014, and they asked me to give a talk about the politics in medical journals.</p> \n<p>“I defended the idea of getting involved, because health is political: The great reforms in the 19th century in Britain, fighting against social depravity, Dickens, Obamacare – it’s all about politics. However, I did say I regretted the polarization that publishing this letter created.”</p> \n<p>How were you received in Israel?</p> \n<p>“People wanted me to retract the letter. I don’t think people believed me. They thought I was just saying that. To prove that I meant it, I said, ‘Let’s work together to produce a series about the health system in Israel and the health of Israelis, which we will publish in The Lancet, just as we did for Palestinians.’ They said yes.”</p> \n<p>And did they believe you?</p> \n<p>“Many people were very skeptical. They thought I was saying it to get out of a bad corner.”</p> \n<p>In the end, though, Horton succeeded in convincing the Israelis that his interest was genuine. And in a subsequent editorial of The Lancet he declared: “This schism helped no one and I certainly regret that result. I have seen for myself that what was written in the letter does not describe the full reality.”</p> \n<p>What reaction are you getting from the other side now? In a way, you’ve won the Israelis’ trust but turned your back on the writers of the letter and their supporters.</p> \n<p>“This is complicated. We’re just doctors, not politicians. We can’t change the world. My Palestinian friends were very nervous – they believe in the boycott [BDS], and I don’t. I’ve said to them the whole time that I don’t believe in the academic and cultural boycott of Israel – it’s self-defeating. At The Lancet we don’t boycott anybody. Boycotts divide people, stop them listening and learning, end discussions, and perpetuate prejudice and hate. It’s a terrible self-inflicted wound by the Palestinians and those who support it.</p> \n<p>“Where do you begin and end a boycott? Every country does things we don’t like. It is far better to sit down and listen and argue and discuss. If we can build trust and confidence in colleagues in Israel and Palestine, we can build a bridge based upon trust and peace. If you could do that in health, why not in education and the economy?”</p> \n<p>A unique health model</p> \n<p>You’ve just published your special issue, “Health in Israel: Progress and Challenges in a Region of Conflict,” which you worked on for two years. From what you learned, what’s the most important thing other countries could adopt from our health system?</p> \n<p>“There’s loads of things. This is one of the reasons I was keen on the series, because there are a lot of lessons other countries can learn. One is the kupat holim [health maintenance organizations]. In most European countries, we don’t have anything like that. Not in the U.K. or France, nor in America.</p> \n<p>“We [in Britain] have a monopoly provider. The problem with monopoly providers is there’s no competition, so it’s very inefficient and there is a lot of waste. Here, you have the commitment to universal care coverage through the 1994 National Health Insurance Law – you’ve got the basic protection, and the [HMOs] allow you to have managed competition. But they don’t compete aggressively like the private sector. They’re like public sector institutions: it’s a very unusual system – they’re competing but they’re not competing. They work together pretty harmoniously and they have the same goal. You get solidarity in the health system and competition to drive up quality and efficiency. It’s a very interesting model, and I haven’t seen anything quite like it in other countries.”</p> \n<p>Is there anything else?</p> \n<p>“Another aspect that’s amazing is the way you link your research with patient care – it’s unusual. Organizations like the Technion, linking engineering, discovery and patient care. In my country, it’s not normal for academic medicine to work with private sector companies. It’s becoming more common, but it’s not popular because the private sector is seen as somewhat bad. You have researchers working side by side with the industries. And they set up companies, their own companies, that explore and exploit the technologies they’re developing. We don’t have any culture like that in Britain.</p> \n<p>“The third element, which is now very politically sensitive in my country, is the issue of immigration. After Brexit, we’re going through a phase where many are anti-immigrant and xenophobic. Here in Israel, you have a history of waves of immigration not weakening the country but strengthening it. You’ve been able to absorb and transform it for the betterment of the country. In Europe, we need to learn the benefits of immigration. Your health system absorbed the immigrants – patients coming in hundreds of thousands, and also health professionals from abroad.”</p> \n<p>Horton adds that he has witnessed something people outside of Israel don’t understand: “I see an exquisite concern for the inequality between Arabs and Jews. Though Israel is characterized as a Jewish state, it’s diverse and pluralistic. In Europe, the fear of immigration creates rising levels of anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim attitudes. People who are ‘other’ with a capital O are seen as a threat.”</p> \n<p>A few weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a health care bill that would eliminate extensive parts of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and could cause 24 million Americans to lose their health insurance. Does The Lancet have a position on this?</p> \n<p>“We’ve just published a series about health care in the United States. We have been looking not specifically at the new bill, but at the health system. The main predicament of the American health system is the growing inequality. This is the theme that drove the election campaign and Trump to power. One of the reasons why the Affordable Care Act was struggling was the rise in premiums and deductibles. This has led to poorer people, who officially have coverage, not being able to afford health care. This issue of inequality is one that, unfortunately, the American health care system can’t deal with. There’s no universal coverage.”</p> \n<p>Did Obama fail to reduce the inequality?</p> \n<p>“The good thing about the Affordable Care Act is that it tries to set a minimum standard. It reduces the risk of inequality. If this goes away, the current bill before the Senate doesn’t protect the minimum standard. If you don’t have coverage for preexisting conditions, you’re going to exacerbate inequality. This is an out-of-pocket expenditure, with catastrophic financial implications. They get plunged into poverty because of medical expenses. If you look at the causes of poverty in America, one of the most common is paying medical bills.”</p> \n<p>What will happen now the act is in danger of being repealed?</p> \n<p>“There’s a real potential crisis in America if the Affordable Care Act is withdrawn, and the new bill cancels the preexisting conditions. They’re not giving enough money to cover the difference. It will increase inequality even more. It’s a terrible spiral. It’s going to divide America even more. It could drive civil disruptions. Health care is like a social glue ... [it] builds solidarity, community.</p> \n<p>“Health care also changes the way people think about a country. We have a paper about Israel treating casualties from the civil war in Syria. This is not what people think of Israel or the Israel Defense Forces. People think about young Palestinians lying on the ground, and an IDF soldier shooting them in the head. Telling this story is really important, to explain how people in the IDF Medical Corps put their lives at risk to help Syrians.”</p> \n<p>A money-making operation</p> \n<p>The Lancet was founded in Britain nearly 200 years ago. Alongside The New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA – The Journal of the American Medical Association, it is one of the most respected medical journals in the world. Since 2015, Horton – a medical doctor by training – has been editor-in-chief, after serving as editor in North America since 1993. Horton also writes medical articles for The Observer, The Times Literary Supplement and The New York Review of Books.</p> \n<p>After many years in key roles in the field, how much influence do you think pharmaceutical companies have on medical journals?</p> \n<p>“We are worried about the influence of industry on the papers we publish. Most of the research is sponsored by the drug industry. They are involved in every stage: design, conduct, analysis and probably publication – they have read the paper and given comments. The opportunity for exaggeration and spin is huge.”</p> \n<p>And how are you combating this?</p> \n<p>“That’s where we come in, take out the exaggeration and stop the spin. The companies try to add it back in. We fight through the proxy of the paper – what we get in the end depends on the journal. At The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine, we can be quite powerful because people want to publish with us. We say to authors, ‘If you don’t change this, we won’t publish.’ This is usually enough. I would say that we win more times than they do. But sometimes they win.”</p> \n<p>Can you give us an example of a distortion that could occur?</p> \n<p>“When you have a new drug, the first study is often small and with a small number of patients. The danger of that is you have a bigger chance of a positive result that turns out to be wrong. From our point of view, it’s a first study, it’s exciting, it’s a new drug, it might be positive. So what do we do? Do we reject the paper because we’re not 100 percent sure? Do we peer review it the best we can and take a risk? We publish the paper because it’s exciting and new, but we honestly don’t know what’s going to happen next.”</p> \n<p>What protects patients from the use of an unready technology that might not really be effective, but which has been positively written about in a leading journal like The Lancet?</p> \n<p>“Twenty-five years ago, you [a doctor] could read a paper in The Lancet and you could go and ask for the drug in your hospital the following day and prescribe it. Thankfully, that can’t happen today, not in Britain. Most doctors know you shouldn’t change your practice on the basis of one paper. A hospital can’t just go and get a supply of the drugs. In America, it’s more dangerous – it’s still more like the Wild West. Private practitioners can see the papers and order the drug. The protections for patients are weaker in a system like in the United States.”</p> \n<p>Horton believes Britain’s National Health Service, by contrast, is sometimes too slow to react. “The danger in our system is that it takes too long to get innovations into practice. I don’t want to say we have the best system – there’s a balance. In Israel, your dialogue about health is very focused on innovation. Because of the [HMOs] and the managed competition, you can’t just do something tomorrow. There’s a bureaucracy that protects you.”</p> \n<p>Last year, you wrote about the crisis in scientific publishing: that despite technological advances, “the state of scientific publishing today has never been more precarious.” You mentioned the mega-journals, “where they can publish hundreds, maybe even thousands of articles,” and a disconnect between the publications and the community they aim to serve. Can you tell us how you are tackling these problems?</p> \n<p>“What is science for? If we go back and look at Diderot’s great encyclopedia in the 17th century, in the introduction it talks about publishing knowledge for the advantages of society. You don’t publish for your CV, for your next grant or for your tenure. The reason why knowledge was being brought together was for specific social purposes. We’ve lost that in science. Unfortunately, we created an academic system that is more about the academy and the career of the scientist than it is about the public and the translation of the research for the benefit of society.”</p> \n<p>That’s a very harsh observation.</p> \n<p>“Right, to my great regret. In the last 400 years, science has lost its soul, its purpose and its meaning. Academic publishing is part of it. We, too, have lost our purpose and our meaning. We have to add moral purpose into science. Why should the public support scientific research unless it’s getting a return back? Scientists want freedom to study – and I understand that – but the pendulum has swung too far toward the scientists and we have to bring it back toward the public.”</p> \n<p>Do you have an example?</p> \n<p>“When there’s a disease like SARS or a new flu, it’s really important to sequence the genome, to introduce a vaccine. If you’re in Thailand or Vietnam, there’s enormous pressure to allow samples to go to labs in the United States and make them available to vaccine manufacturers, who are set to make a huge profit.</p> \n<p>“The countries don’t get any benefit – they will have to pay for the vaccine. The system steals intellectual property from these countries. In the life sciences, there are basic discoveries that get commercialized and the profit goes to the industry. If you want to have innovative medicine, companies have to invest. I don’t want to be naive, but there has to be a balance between what the public invests and what they are allowed to take as profit.”</p> \n<p>As an example, Horton offers one particular area in which the pharmaceutical companies have no interest in investing in research and development: resistance to antibiotics.</p> \n<p>“Drug companies pulled out from investing in development of antibiotics.

        "text":["<p>On Tuesday, the Israel Democracy Institute will hold a symposium called “Commemorating 30 years since the capture of Ron Arad,” which will deal with the problem of freeing captured Israeli soldiers. Naturally, the discussion will focus on the tactical aspects, as did Amos Harel’s article “The Ron Arad file: Israel’s three major missed opportunities to recover MIA aviator.”</p> \n<p>The article, dealing with the fate of the Israel Air Force navigator captured by Shi’ite militiamen when his plane crashed in southern Lebanon 30 years ago, tries to explain why Israel was unable to find out where Arad was being held, get him back and even find out whether he was dead or alive.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Harel dealt with these three failures on the tactical level, pointing to immediate events that supposedly thwarted Israeli efforts: Arad’s falling into the hands of Mustafa Dirani, who belonged to an extreme wing of the Shi’ite Amal movement, demands made by Amal for his release and our unwillingness to declare Arad dead until 2005, despite evidence to the contrary from the late 1980s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, Arad’s disappearance and death in captivity did not result from tactical mishaps, but from a broader failure on the strategic level. The strategic failure was in our flawed understanding of the politics of southern Lebanon; specifically, our underestimating the importance of the Shi’ites of the south and their main movement, Amal. This failure did not occur after Arad’s plane crashed, but during the three years between our invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and our withdrawal, in 1985, to the pre-war security zone that ran along Israel’s northern border. This failure left us with no significant contacts outside the security zone who might have been able to aid in Arad's return in the critical first few weeks of his captivity.</p> \n<p>When planning the first Lebanon war, Israel's Military Intelligence and the Mossad focused solely on our Christian allies in Lebanon, overlooking the Shi’ites, who constituted 80 percent of the population between our border and Sidon, and Amal, which had been fighting the PLO in southern Lebanon on its own. Even after the Shi’ites welcomed our invasion with flowers (in the hope that we would remove the PLO from the south) and Amal helped in locating the whereabouts of PLO leaders and weapons caches, and kept the peace with the IDF for two entire years, Israel dismissed the possibility of an alliance with them, however informal, continuing to consider only the Christians.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In keeping with this approach, the IDF was given very few directives on how to strengthen our contacts with the Shi’ites and Amal, leading to a neglect of their sensibilities, needs and interests. Our actions (for instance, Israeli military vehicles interrupting the sacred Shi'ite Ashura procession in Nabatiyeh) signaled to the Shi'ites they weren't high on our agenda. Thus, by the time we withdrew to the security zone in 1985, Israel’s contacts were completely gone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the day following the withdrawal, the senior Shin Bet security service representative in southern Lebanon called to alert me (even though I was no longer serving) of a possible phone call I might receive from Amal. He related that on the previous day he had parted from the leaders of Amal in Tyre and raised the possibility of future contact, offering them various numbers to call. They declined to record them, saying, “If we need anything, we’ll call Dr. Bailey.” The call never came.</p> \n<p>Thus, when Arad fell captive 16 months later, there was no one to contact. This was particularly regrettable, as when his plane crashed he was held for two weeks by a regional Amal leader closely related to a main Israeli contact, the Amal commander of southern Lebanon, Mohammed Ghaddar. The friendly relations with Ghaddar had ended only in 1984, after an overly high-profile visit by then Defense Minister Moshe Arens which attracted the attention and reprobation of Amal leader Nabih Berri.</p> \n<p>Our strategic underestimation of Amal’s role in the south led not only to the specific tragedy of Ron Arad, but also to the rise of Hezbollah and the hundreds of lives Israel lost fighting it in Lebanon. Our policy didn’t change even when Amal fought a bitter war with Hezbollah in 1987 and 1988 for predominance among the Shi’ites, and Israel refused to furnish it with supplies. The result was Hezbollah’s emergence as the leading faction in Lebanese politics and a lasting threat to Israel.</p> \n<p>Dr. Clinton Bailey served as a liaison to the Amal movement and Advisor on Shi'ite Affairs in Israel's Ministry of Defense.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Haaretz has lost its way in the past several weeks, or perhaps it’s not something that happened recently: Identification with the narrative of the enemy and the instinctive antagonism, to the point of hatred, of anything that hints of nationalism have driven its writers mad. This time I was the pretext for the outburst of memories from the terrible days of World War II (“The Israel lawmaker heralding genocide against Palestinians,” Daniel Blatman, May 23; “Smotrich as a sign of things to come,” Zeev Sternhell, May 26, Hebrew edition).</p> \n<p>It began with the groundless accusation that I had called for the systematic killing of women and children (“Why religious Zionism is growing darker,” Tomer Persico, May 17). It never happened. It was based on a distorted, tendentious leak by a participant in a closed meeting in which I explained my political philosophy. She made the accusation in a Facebook post; people who consider themselves serious, including some professors, fell for this nonsense and built entire theories and interpretations upon it. I hope Prof. Sternhell’s academic research is founded on more-solid facts and figures.</p> \n<p>What did I say? I said that in the Land of Israel, two contradictory national aspirations dwell together, and that the entire foundation for defining the Palestinian national movement relies on the negation of the Zionist movement. The Palestinian national movement was established as a countermovement to Zionism movement, and so the right of the Palestinian “nation” to exist is based in the denial of Israel’s existence as a Jewish state. That is why the chances of reaching a peace agreement with the Palestinians, based on the continued existence of these two conflicting national aspirations by means of an artificial geographical division and on Palestinian recognition of the Jewish state, is virtually nil.</p> \n<p>On the practical level, that is the fundamental difference between me and the left. The left buries its head in the sand, believing these contradictory aspirations can be reconciled, while I do not. The reality of recent decades supports my viewpoint. We have always extended our hand in peace; they have always rejected it at the moment of truth: the 1947 United Nations partition plan, the Oslo Accords, Camp David and then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s negotiations. That is no coincidence: If they recognize us they will pull out the rug from under their right to exist as a national entity.</p> \n<p>Given the fact that these are two contradictory national aspirations, we have two options: to continue the bloody conflict for another 100 years, or to decide it. Hence my plan, which is first and foremost one of political consciousness. I want to etch into the consciousness of the other side the understanding that there is no chance an Arab state will be established in the Land of Israel, through the “settlement solution.” When we impose sovereignty over Judea and Samaria, create additional settlements there and bring in hundreds of thousands more settlers, the Arabs will realize that it’s irreversible, that their dream is over.</p> \n<p>There are two possible human responses to this unambiguous situation: The realists will understand and accept it, while the “Don Quixotes” will try to fight it. The realists will also fall into two groups: those who accept the reality will also be divided into two groups: those who choose to remain and to enjoy a personal life far superior to that of Arabs in neighboring states, and those who will not relinquish their national aspirations and will choose to fulfill them in one of the Arab states or in any other country.</p> \n<p>Those who refuse to accept the new reality and choose to fight it through violence will encounter the “military solution,” in the form of a determined Israeli army with a mandate from the political leaders to achieve victory and to eliminate terror. There is nothing more just and moral than Israel’s right to defend itself against those who would destroy it. Would such a war require indiscriminate total slaughter? Of course not. You’d have to be a total fool to think that. Those who remain won’t be forced to sing the national anthem. All they need do is not to take up arms.</p> \n<p>My program is the key to peace. The alternatives, from the left and from the self-styled right, that are based on leaving in place an Arab collective with national aspirations that contradict our national aspirations, guarantee the perpetuation of the conflict and its high costs for another century. I want peace and coexistence; therefore, I want to decide the conflict. Had the Arabs not waged war for a century for the purpose of destroying Israel, not a single Jew would want to harm or to expel even a single Arab.</p> \n<p>Nor do we want to destroy the Arab national hope for a state between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River simply because we enjoy destroying the hopes of others. We are forced to do so, because their national aspiration conflicts with our own, and on the practical level it is attempting to destroy us. We are forced to do so because it’s either them or us, and given that choice, I unhesitatingly choose us.</p> \n<p>It is sad that for some of the writers at Haaretz, and perhaps a handful of its readers as well, words such as victory and defeating the enemy are offensive terms that are reminiscent of the Holocaust. You can agree or disagree with my plan, you can think it realistic or hopeless, but to claim that it bears any resemblance to the Nazi worldview is an insult to the intelligence. We would expect “the newspaper for people who think,” according to an old Haaretz advertising slogan, not to disparage the intelligence of its readers.</p> \n<p>Bezalel Smotrich is a Knesset member for Habayit Hayehudi.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jewish organizations responded with outrage to Sunday's Israeli cabinet decision to cede to ultra-Orthodox pressure and suspend a plan&nbsp;to create an egalitarian prayer space at the Western Wall, where Reform and Conservative Jews could hold mixed prayer services.</p> \n<p>Only two members of the cabinet, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, voted against the move, which was forced on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, who do not consider the Reform and Conservative Jewish religious practice legitimate. The plan to create a permanent egalitarian prayer space at the southern expanse of the Western Wall, approved by the cabinet in January 2016, had been hailed as historic in most of the Jewish world.</p> \n<p>In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said efforts would be made to reach a new compromise at the Western Wall. Spearheading these efforts would be Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, of Netanyahu's Likud party, and Cabinet Secretary Tzachi Braverman.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the statement said, infrastructure work would begin on the southern expanse of the Western Wall in preparation for a new plan that would enable egalitarian prayer services in that area and be acceptable to both the non-Orthodox movements and the ultra-Orthodox parties.</p> \n<p>Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky, the key architect of the Western Wall plan, expressed deep disappointment with the government decision. “Five years ago, the prime minister asked me to lead a joint effort to bring about a workable formula that would transform the Western Wall into, in his own words, ‘one wall for one people,’” Sharansky said in a statement.</p> \n<p>“After four years of intense negotiations, we reached a solution that was accepted by all major denominations and was then adopted by the government and embraced by the world’s Jewish communities. Today’s decision signifies a retreat from that agreement and will make our work to bring Israel and the Jewish world closer together increasingly more difficult. The Jewish Agency nevertheless remains staunchly committed to that work and to the principle of one wall for one people,” he said. Sharansky was not given advance notice by Netanyahu of his intent to push through the decision on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The Jewish Agency executive committee is due to hold a special meeting early&nbsp;Monday to decide what, if any, measures should be taken in response to the cabinet decision. That will be followed by an emergency session of the Jewish Agency board of governors, which will be asked to approve any proposals drafted. Sources at the Jewish Agency said it was unlikely that any “retaliatory” measures would be adopted against the Israeli government, adding that the board would probably suffice with a strongly worded statement expressing its disappointment. Some board members had broached the idea of boycotting a dinner scheduled for&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;evening with Prime Minister Netanyahu but their proposal was immediately rejected.</p> \n<p>Yizhar Hess, the executive director of the Conservative movement in Israel, called the government decision a “capitulation to the ultra-Orthodox parties,” noting that “nothing like this has ever happened before.” He thanked the two ministers who voted against the decision, but said he was “absolutely astonished by the other ministers, and the prime minister above all.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the congregational arm of Reform Jewry in North America, called the government’s decision an “unconscionable insult” and threatened to take action. &quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to say 'no' to his previous 'yes' is an unconscionable insult to the majority of world Jewry,” said Jacobs in a statement. &quot;We are assessing all next steps. The Israeli Supreme Court will rule, but even in waiting for the court, we will not be still or silent. The stranglehold that the Chief Rabbinate and the ultra-Orthodox parties have on Israel and the enfranchisement of the majority of Jews in Israel and the world must—and will—be ended.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Reform Jewish movement in Israel, called the decision a “disgrace” and warned that it would deal a harsh blow to the “basic interests of the State of Israel and the Jewish people.” He said that the prime minister and his cabinet colleagues had given their support to an “anti-Zionist move” that would hurt Israel’s relations with Diaspora Jewry and weaken the connection of millions of Jews to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The cabinet decision came the same day that the state had been due to submit its response to a petition filed by the non-Orthodox movements and Women of the Wall, the multi-denominational feminist prayer group, demanding that the agreement be implemented. In the alternative, the petitioners seek to have the existing gender-segregated areas of the Western Wall re-divided to make room for them.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox partners had pressured him to scrap the plan entirely but the prime minister preferred to call for a “freeze,” aware that a vote to cancel the plan in its entirety would spark an even harsher backlash in the Jewish world.</p> \n<p>The Israeli Chief Rabbinate, which had been pressuring Netanyahu behind the scenes to retreat from the plan, welcomed the cabinet decision. “The government decision to divide the Western Wall, which is the heart of the Jewish people -- was a mistake to begin with, and it is good that it was stopped,” said Rabbi David Lau, the chief Ashkenazi rabbi. “The Western Wall is not dividable.”</p> \n<p>As of Sunday afternoon, the state had yet to meet its deadline for a response to the court petition. Kariv told Haaretz that the petitioners had no intention of withdrawing their petition following the government's announcement. “Our first priority has always been to have part of the traditional Kotel area allotted to us, and that is what we will fight for now in court,” he said.</p> \n<p>Anat Hoffman, the chairwoman of Women of the Wall, described the decision to suspend implementation of the existing plan “shameful” and said it was particularly disturbing that women who sit in the cabinet raised their hands in favor of it.</p> \n<p>“The fact that the prime minister, who himself initiated and led the agreement, is bending and retreating from that historic decision is shameful to the government and its women ministers who were exposed [as voting] against women,” she said. “It’s a terrible day for women in Israel when the prime minister sacrifices their rights while kowtowing to a handful of religious extremists who want to enforce their religious customs while intentionally violating the rights of the majority of the Jewish world, 51 percent being women.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s decision almost five years ago to seek a compromise over prayer at the Western Wall was prompted by violent clashes that broke out each month when Women of the Wall activists held their monthly prayer service at the holy site, many of them wearing prayer shawls and phylacteries (tefillin) – in defiance of ultra-Orthodox practice that reserves their use by men.</p> \n<p>Ne’emanei Torah Va’Avodah, a liberal Orthodox group, also expressed outrage at the decision. “It’s a shame that the government decided once again to break ties with Diaspora Jewry and spit in its face,” the organization said in a statement. “A new plan that allows Jews around the world to feel connected to the Kotel must be formulated as soon as possible.”</p> \n<p>Rabbi Julie Schonfeld, executive vice president of the Conservative movement’s Rabbinical Assembly, said the government’s decision did not come as a total surprise to her since no steps were ever taken to implement the agreement. “At the same time,” she said, “I’m stunned that the government of Israel would so betray the interests of its own people.”</p> \n<p>Nachman Shai, co-chair of the Knesset caucus for U.S.-Israel relations and a member of the opposition Zionist Union, said that American Jews have good reason to feel betrayed today. “The backward flip that the government did this morning shows that it's great in acrobatics but poor in trustworthiness,” he said.</p> \n<p>The leader of the Zionist Union, Isaac Herzog, called the decision &quot;another capitulation by Netanyahu over his promises, turning his back on the Jewish communities of the Diaspora and harming the delicate fabric that unites the entire mosaic of the Jewish people.&quot; The Western Wall, Herzog said, &quot;is holy to the entire Jewish people and everyone has an equal right to it.&quot; He vowed to replace the Netanyahu government with a centrist electoral bloc that would &quot;respect everyone in their faith at the Wall.&quot;</p> \n<p>The American Jewish Committee expressed deep disappointment with the government’s decision.&nbsp;“The Kotel belongs to all Jews worldwide, not to a self-appointed segment,” said AJC CEO David Harris. “This decision is a setback for Jewish unity and the essential ties that bind Israel and American Jews, the two largest centers of Jewish life in the world.”</p> \n<p>The Jewish Federations of North America, the umbrella organization for Jewish federations in the United States and Canada, also denounced the government decision. &quot;We are disappointed and frustrated by the government's decision,” said JFNA president and CEO Jerry Silverman. &quot;The hope and expectation of Jews throughout North America is that the government will see fit to honor their commitment to ensuring one Wall for one people.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based think tank, denounced the government decision, saying it was&nbsp;“another case of backtracking from its responsibility for maintaining freedom of religion at the Western Wall.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“The decision prevents the implementation of a fitting solution that was already passed by the [cabinet] and that could have resolved a practical and symbolic dispute with the Reform and Conservative streams of Judaism,&quot; said IDI Vice President Yedidia Stern in a&nbsp;statement. In effect, it places the decision-making on the issue in the hands of the Supreme Court, he said. The IDI called the cabinet decision &quot;yet another example of this government mocking Diaspora Jewry and freedom of religion, and not taking responsibility for issues that are within its authority.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Reut Institute, an independent policy institute based in Tel Aviv, warned that that government’s decision will&nbsp;“deepen the alienation felt among many Jews in the world today in relation to the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>“When Israel denies the largest Jewish denominations in North America the right to pray at the Kotel according to their custom, it weakens not only their connection to the State of Israel, but also challenges their ability to maintain a Jewish identity in the Diaspora,” the institute said in a statement. “Israeli actions that delegitimize non-Orthodox Judaism limit the ability of educators and communal leaders to nurture a positive Jewish identity and relationship with Israel.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A few days ago, I encountered a daring idea in these pages. Nave Dromi (Haaretz, June 20) proposed an interpretive and autonomous reading of the “text” written by Prof. Asa Kasher, in isolation from everything we know about the historical, ideological, political and social conditions under which the wretched creature known as the academic code of ethics was created — a kind of “text” sailing quietly on the pure waters of logic, rosy and open to every possible reading. A genuine female, Israeli version of Roland Barthes has arisen among us, and — to help the code go down more easily — she announces the death of the author.</p> \n<p>As to the identity of the author whose death (symbolic, of course, calm down) Dromi announces — Kasher or the person who commissioned the “text,” Education Minister Naftali Bennett — the op-ed does not say. But it doesn’t spare us what has recently become all too common in the right’s semi-intellectual battle, piling on terms like “postmodernism” and “progressive truth” to the point of suffocation.</p> \n<p>In other words, Dromi, who apparently leafed quickly through a lexicon of cultural theory, tells her imaginary average liberal reader, who believes that academic freedom must be preserved, that in fact, this code is a good thing even according to his own view, because he, that is, the reader, believes that there is no one single truth. Therefore, he must allow competing truths — oops! I almost said “alternative” — to exist in peace in a world of multiple truths.</p> \n<p>Much has already been written about the Kasher-Bennett proposal, which would castrate thought and teaching, and the sweeping rebellion that has arisen against it constitutes one of the most beautiful moments in our exhausted civil society. Therefore, I wouldn’t have bothered writing about Dromi’s piece had it not been a salient example of the new tactic of argumentation adopted by the right’s cadets — “I will use your own worldview, in a distorted form, for the sole purpose of tying it around your necks and hanging you by it” — which is also used lavishly by Haaretz contributors Irit Linur and Gadi Taub.</p> \n<p>This method recalls Bennett’s impersonation of a Tel Aviv hipster in his campaign ads. Dromi bolsters her defense of the code of ethics with the help of American universities, where “there’s a concept called a ‘safe space,’ which allows for voicing opinions without feeling threatened. Today it’s identified mainly with the left. ... In its initial format, however, the concept is positive.”</p> \n<p>This is interpretation according to Barthes: You people on the left are pathetic and hard to credit, but if you’ve gone that far with your postmodernist bullshit, why shouldn’t I use it to tell you that the code of ethics essentially functions as the equivalent of safe spaces on American campuses? It merely preserves freedom of thought and expression.</p> \n<p>But go right ahead and rely on those Americans; they really do stand up for freedom of expression. Consequently, the American Association of University Professors vehemently denounced the code of ethics, saying it violated academic freedom and undermined Israeli democracy, without giving any advance warning to Kasher, Bennett and Dromi, who all depended on them.</p> \n<p>And therefore, Dromi, here is what I have to say: The code is not a literary text, and it should not be read interpretively. Its goal is not to create safe spaces for students and teachers. It is an intimidating directive about how to teach, what to teach and how to think. </p> \n<p>I have no problem with arguments from people who disagree with my view. But I do have a problem with deception. You want to back an antidemocratic measure? Fine. Use the cognitive infrastructure of your own world of values. Take Carl Schmitt and leave Barthes to us.</p>",

The sale has been delayed for about two years, but in the past few weeks it was brought to the Indian cabinet for approval. If the deal is finalized, 2017 will be a record year in terms of Israeli weapons sales to India, a major client of Israeli defense industries. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last year, the Indian government signed two large deals with the Israel Aerospace Industries, a government-owned company that develops and sells defense and weapons systems.

It is a joint need, both for them and for us,” said the officer.</p> \n<p>Over the past few years, India has shown interest in buying additional weapon systems from Israel, including the Phalcon early warning, command and control and intelligence planes or drones. The $1 billion-Phalcon deal, also considered to be a huge contract, has yet to be implemented even though it was approved by the Indian cabinet.</p> \n<p>Israeli companies are also discussing the sale of drones with the Indian government, including the IAI’s Heron TP, known in Israel as the Eitan, which was shown at a defense show in India this year. Despite the optimism concerning the weapons deals, Israel is not at all certain that Modi’s visit will bring about significant progress in these agreements.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's highly guarded convoy made its way from the Budapest airport to his hotel on Monday, he could easily have noticed five large blue billboards showing Jewish tycoon George Soros that are still displayed along the highway.</p> \n<p>The Hungarian government had said it would remove the signs, which carry a whiff of anti-Semitism (and some of which had swastikas spray-painted on them), ahead of Netanyahu’s visit, but it did not do so, at least not completely.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s visit to Hungary, the first by an Israeli prime minister in over 30 years, was supposed to have been a festive occasion devoid of drama. But because of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s campaign against Soros, Netanyahu’s visit has come to be regarded as a test of the right-wing Israeli government’s attitude toward the nationalist right-wing governments in Europe. These governments do not often criticize the occupation or the settlements, but they try to rewrite the history of their countries during the Holocaust and implement nationalist and racist policies that can stir anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>When Netanyahu attended a ceremony in Paris together with French President Emmanuel Macron commemorating the 75th anniversary of the deportation of Parisian Jews, it only highlighted this point. Macron, whose speech was broadcast live, spoke directly to the French public against any attempt to minimize its role and that of the Vichy government in what befell French Jews during the Holocaust. In contrast, Orban recently gave a speech filled with praise for Hitler ally Miklos Horthy, who was responsible for sending a half-million Hungarian Jews to the concentration camps.</p> \n<p>In a briefing to reporters following his meeting with Macron, Netanyahu spoke at length about the French president’s speech and its important messages concerning the Holocaust and anti-Semitism. He has been less eager to discuss Orban’s speech. “I instructed the Israeli ambassador to make our position on this matter known,” said Netanyahu. “This was done and they made a revision. I intend to discuss this with Orban during our meeting.”</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Wednesday evening, Netanyahu will meet with members of the Jewish community at Budapest’s Great Synagogue. Such an event, usually a routine part of a prime minister’s visit to a foreign country, has taken on much more significance in light of the recent events in Hungary. Last week, Andras Heisler, head of the Hungarian Jewish community, met with officials from the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Heisler is said to have conveyed a message of concern over the growing anti-Semitic atmosphere in Hungary and over what is seen as the Israeli government’s overly forgiving attitude. In a meeting Heisler held at the Foreign Ministry he voiced harsher criticism and expressed disappointment at the conduct of the Israeli government in the affair. &quot;We thought Israel would be at our side in times of need but we discovered that this was not the case and that diplomatic interests overcame the need to fight anti-Semitism,&quot; he said, according to Israeli officials.</p> \n<p>While in Jerusalem, Heisler met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Jonathan Schachter. Sources in the Jewish community and senior Israeli officials said Heisler spoke of the great disappointment with the Israeli government, especially with how it has responded to the posters against Soros. Netanyahu must realize that there is genuine fear that this campaign by Orban is fueling anti-Semitic sentiments, the head of the Jewish community told Schachter. Heisler added that some in the community believe that Netanyahu should have called off the visit in Budapest in protest of Orban's conduct, however others think this campaign stresses the need for such a visit.</p> \n<p>The head of the Jewish community told Schachter that Netanyahu must understand that the Jews of Hungary do not support Soros, but are genuinely anxious about the situation in the country, including Orban's current political campaign. He has also asked that during his visit the prime minister make clear Israel's position on the struggle against anti-Semitism.At a press briefing in Paris on Sunday, Netanyahu began to provide the necessary clarification. “We stand against displays of anti-Semitism towards Israel and towards all groups of Jews, whether in France or in Hungary,&quot; Netanyahu said. &quot;This is our position – make no mistake about it.&quot;</p> \n<p>It remains to be seen what he will tell Orban when they meet on Tuesday.</p>",

How Israel Went From 'Contaminated' by Colonialism to India's Strategic Ally</p> \n<p>As Narendra Modi arrives this week for the first state visit ever by an Indian prime minister to Israel, both he and his host Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be marking a significant warming up of ties between the two countries. But it will also express the fulfillment of a long-unrequited desire, dating back to the early days of the Jewish state, for close ties with, and recognition from, India. (Khinvraj Jangid / Opinion)</p> \n<p>9:00 A.M.&nbsp;Wake up, Israel! Modi's visit will make history</p> \n<p>The public’s excitement in Israel when U.S. President Donald Trump visited in May was immense. His visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem was covered live on television and radio, even though Trump, as expected, had nothing significant to say there. Just months into his administration, Trump’s problematic performance in office has already undermined his credibility and power, but in Israel every minute of his one-day visit was followed as if it were an event of the greatest importance.</p> \n<p>The childish awe that accompanied the president stands in unfortunate contrast to the indifference greeting the next state visit to Israel. Unlike the Trump visit, this one will mark an historic occasion: the first-ever by the prime minister of this country. This individual presides over an economy that is growing at a dizzying pace and could one day emerge as the world’s largest. Yet days before the arrival of the world's most important prime minister – India's Narendra Modi – Israel is asleep at the watch. (Meirav Arlosoroff / Analysis)</p> \n<p>8:55 A.M. Does Trump's instability mean Israel should pivot toward India?</p> \n<p>Judging by the multiple ‘promo’ articles in the Indian and Israel press pre-announcing the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Israel in July 2017, India could be Israel’s greatest ally. Uncertain of President Trump’s stand on several key issues, will 'redemption' come to Jerusalem via New Delhi?</p> \n<p>Indeed, the stakes are high. Israel has already signed on its largest deal in history: a $2 billion defense agreement (reportedly, $1.6 billion for Israel Aerospace Industries and $0.4 billion for Rafael, a a state-owned defense company) by which India will purchase anti-missile systems &nbsp;and components made in Israel. (Shalva Weil / Opinion)</p> \n<p>8:50 A.M.&nbsp;Why Modi can afford to ignore the Palestinians</p> \n<p>With Narendra Modi’s visit to Israel starting on Tuesday – the first ever by a sitting Indian prime minister – &nbsp;it will be like the two countries arriving hand in hand to opening night of the opera season, lit by a barrage of flashing cameras.</p> \n<p>Perhaps even more strikingly, Modi’s visit will not include a stopover in Ramallah as most world leaders visiting Israel do, Indian President Pranab Mukherjee and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj last year. India hasn’t abandoned the Palestinian cause, as Modi’s apparent snub would suggest. But it does signal a new strategy of “de-hyphenating” the Israeli-Palestinian issue. That can only leave the Palestinians worse off. (David Rosenberg / Opinion)</p> \n<p>8:45 A.M. A rundown of India's hefty arms deals with Israel</p> \n<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to sign an agreement to purchase more weapons systems during his visit to Israel on Tuesday, Indian media outlets have reported.</p> \n<p>One of the likely deals includes the purchase of 8,000 Spike anti-tank missiles, worth about $500 million, from Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The sale has been delayed for about two years, but in the past few weeks it was brought to the Indian cabinet for approval. If the deal is finalized, 2017 will be a record year in terms of Israeli weapons sales to India, a major client of Israeli defense industries. (Gili Cohen)</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was to be expected that the near unanimous outrage among non-Orthodox American Jews over the Israeli government’s backtracking on its Western Wall promises would be resented by the ultra-Orthodox and those who support the Kotel status quo.</p> \n<p>But the strong pushback from the liberal denominations and the broader American Jewish community has also gotten negative feedback from those who might be thought of natural allies in any battle with Israel’s Orthodox power-brokers. The Jewish left as well as the Palestinians view the anger and the threats of cutting back funding for Israeli causes with a combination of resentment and disbelief.</p> \n<p>Why, people like Simone Zimmerman (&quot;It's Only About Them: U.S. Jews' Outrage on the Wall, Silence on the Occupation Is Obscene&quot;) and Nasreen Hadad Haj-Yahya Opinion (&quot;American Jews, Can You Spare Some Outrage for Israel's Arab Citizens?&quot;) ask, are liberal Jews ready to head to the barricades over plans for easier access and expanded space for an egalitarian prayer area at the Wall, when the same groups tread so softly when it comes to disagreements about settlements and the peace process? It makes no sense to them.</p> \n<p>But that betrays a misunderstanding of both the relative importance of faith issues to Diaspora Jews and the nuanced attitudes of American liberals toward Israel’s government. While these activists may think efforts to end the occupation should be an American Jewish priority, even those U.S. Jews who are relatively critical of the Netanyahu government actually have a very different take on the issue.</p> \n<p>The disconnect here is understandable. Some Americans, like Rena Singer (&quot;To Simone Zimmerman: Reform Jews Must Choose the Wall or the Palestinians? That's Wrong and Insulting&quot;) share Zimmerman’s fervor when it comes to protesting settlements and supporting Palestinian demands but insist the Reform movement can fight for those causes as well as being vocal about pluralism.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Haj-Yahya isn’t wrong when she notes the fact that the backlash over liberal Jews’ prayer at the Wall seems to be an exception to Cynthia Ozicks’s observation that &quot;universalism is the parochialism&quot; of the Jews. Liberals are usually more comfortable speaking up for others, rather than their own interest - but not here.</p> \n<p>The left thinks that polls that tend to show most American Jews having little sympathy for the positions of the Israeli right ought to translate into more support for activism like that of Zimmerman’s IfNotNow group, as well as even more extreme organizations like Jewish Voices for Peace that support BDS or even take anti-Zionist stands.</p> \n<p>So when U.S. Jews act as if the campaigns of what are, in reality, a relatively small number of Israelis for respect for pluralism, are more important than those of the Palestinians, they see hypocrisy if not something far worse.</p> \n<p>But it’s not that simple. What Zimmerman, Haj-Yahya and even many on the Israeli right don’t get is that there is a big difference between not loving Netanyahu and even worrying about the impact of settlements and sharing the perspectives of the left about the peace process.</p> \n<p>Part of the problem is the difference between being an Israeli and a Diaspora Jew. Secular Israelis think of religion as only one aspect of Jewish identity that many see as optional or of no importance at all. But to be a Jew in the Diaspora is inextricably tied with religion, even if your faith is, as some of Reform Judaism’s critics quip, the Democratic Party platform with holidays thrown in. That means Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist Jews are always going to react to government support for Haredi attacks on their denominations with more urgency than their stance on the settlements.</p> \n<p>Moreover, mainstream American liberals tend to see the conflict with the Palestinians in a more nuanced way than that of the Israeli left. The distinction here is crucial. A lot of the people who give to Israeli causes and support AIPAC would probably vote against Netanyahu, if they were in Israel. But most don’t think the continuation of the conflict is all Israel’s fault, and they don’t necessarily want to force his hand in the peace talks, as the left demands. Nor do they see Israel as an oppressor, because they are just as concerned about Palestinian intransigence and support for terror.</p> \n<p>For the American liberal mainstream, settlements are not as much of a hot button issue as the Kotel. Those on the left who want American Jews to view Israel from a perspective divorced from faith, or not rooted in their perception of the realities of the conflict with the Palestinians, are always going to be disappointed.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

        "text":["<p>For two years now a document that makes for difficult reading has been lying in the archives of the association to commemorate the heritage of Lehi – the Fighters for the Freedom of Israel pre-state underground militia. It was written by a member of the underground about 70 years ago. Reading it could reopen a bleeding wound from the days of the War of Independence that to this day stirs a great deal of emotion in Israeli society.</p> \n<p>“Last Friday together with Etzel” – the acronym for the National Military Organization, also known as the Irgun, another pre-state underground militia, led by Menachem Begin – “our movement carried out a tremendous operation to occupy the Arab village on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road – Deir Yassin. I participated in this operation in the most active way,” wrote Yehuda Feder, whose nom de guerre in Lehi (also known as the Stern Gang) was “Giora.”</p> \n<p>Further along in the letter, he describes in detail his part in the massacre that took place there. “This was the first time in my life that at my hands and before my eyes Arabs fell. In the village I killed an armed Arab man and two Arab girls of 16 or 17 who were helping the Arab who was shooting. I stood them against a wall and blasted them with two rounds from the Tommy gun,” he wrote, describing how he carried out the execution of the girls with a submachine gun.</p> \n<p>Along with that, he tells about looting in the village with his buddies after it was occupied. “We confiscated a lot of money and silver and gold jewelry fell into our hands,” he wrote. He concludes the letter with the words: “This was a really tremendous operation and it is with reason that the left is vilifying us again.”</p> \n<p>This letter is one of the historical documents revealed in a new documentary film entitled “Born in Deir Yassin” by director Neta Shoshani, who devoted the past several years to comprehensive historical research on the Deir Yassin massacre, one of the constitutive incidents of the War of Independence, which has remained a blot on Israel to this day.</p> \n<p>In advance of the premiere screening of the film at the Jerusalem Film Festival, Shoshani showed Haaretz the testimonies she has gathered about the incident, the result of extensive digging in archives along with in-depth interviews with the last living participants in the action. Some of them broke a silence of decades when they spoke to her, often for the first time in front of a camera.</p> \n<p>The assault on the village of Deir Yassin began on the morning of April 9, 1948, as part of Operation Nachshon to break through the blockaded road to Jerusalem, with the participation of about 130 Lehi and Irgun fighters who received aid from the Haganah – the pre-independence army. The fighters encountered stiff resistance and sniper fire and advanced slowly through the village lanes while throwing grenades and blowing up houses.</p> \n<p>Four of the fighters were killed and dozens were wounded. The number of Arab inhabitants who were killed there and the circumstances of their deaths has been disputed for many years, but most researchers state that 110 inhabitants of the village, among them women, children and elderly people, were killed there.</p> \n<p>“They ran like cats,” related the commander of the operation, Yehoshua Zettler, the Jerusalem commander of Lehi, as he described the Arabs fleeing from their homes. Shoshani interviewed him in 2009, a few weeks before his death. Zettler denied that his people carried out a massacre in the village but he spared no words to describe the way its inhabitants were killed. “I won’t tell you that we were there with kid gloves on. House after house ... we’re putting in explosives and they are running away. An explosion and move on, an explosion and move on and within a few hours, half the village isn’t there any more,” he said.</p> \n<p>Zettler also provided a harsh account of the burning of the bodies of those who were killed, after the village was occupied. “Our guys made a number of mistakes there that made me angry. Why did they do that?” he said. “They took dead people, piled them up and burned them. There began to be a stink. This is not so simple.”</p> \n<p>Another harsh account was provided by Prof. Mordechai Gichon, a lieutenant colonel in the Israel Defense Forces reserves, who was a Haganah intelligence officer sent to Deir Yassin when the battle ended. “To me it looked a bit like a pogrom,” said Gichon, who died about a year ago. “If you’re occupying an army position – it’s not a pogrom, even if a hundred people are killed. But if you are coming into a civilian locale and dead people are scattered around in it – then it looks like a pogrom. When the Cossacks burst into Jewish neighborhoods, then that should have looked something like this.”</p> \n<p>According to Gichon, “There was a feeling of considerable slaughter and it was hard for me to explain it to myself as having been done in self-defense. My impression was more of a massacre than anything else. If it is a matter of killing innocent civilians, then it can be called a massacre.”</p> \n<p>Yair Tsaban, a former Meretz MK and government minister, related in his interview with Shoshani that after the massacre, in which he did not participate, he was sent with fellow members of the Youth Brigades to bury the corpses of the dead. “The rationale was that the Red Cross was liable to show up at any moment and it was necessary to blur the traces [of the killings] because publication of pictures and testimonies about what had happened in the village would be very damaging to the image of our War of Independence,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I saw a fair number of corpses,” he added. “I don’t remember encountering the corpse of a fighting man. Not at all. I remember mostly women and old men.” Tsaban testified that he saw inhabitants shot in the back and dismissed the claims of some of participants in the action that the locals had been hit in exchanges of fire. “An old man and a woman, sitting in the corner of a room with their faces to the wall, and they are shot in the back,” he recalled. “That cannot have been in the heat of battle. No way.”</p> \n<p>The massacre at Deir Yassin had many repercussions. The Jewish Agency, the chief rabbis and the heads of the Haganah condemned it. The left used it to denounce the right. Abroad, it was compared to the crimes of the Nazis. Additionally, as historian Benny Morris notes in his book “Righteous Victims,” “Deir Yassin had a profound demographic and political effect: It was followed by mass flight of Arabs from their locales.”</p> \n<p>Shoshani first became interested in the Deir Yassin story about a decade ago, while working on her final project at the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem, which focused on visual documentation of the Kfar Shaul state psychiatric hospital, which in turn was built on the lands of Deir Yassin after the war. Following her documentation of the place as it is today, with its buildings that had served the village’s inhabitants in the past and today are part of the hospital, she also wanted to find historical pictures of the massacre that took place there 70 years ago.</p> \n<p>To her surprise, she found that the task was not at all simple. “On the internet are pictures of corpses that are captioned as having been photographed at Deir Yassin, but they are from Sabra and Chatila,” she says, referring to the 1982 massacre by Christian militiamen of hundreds of residents of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. “In the IDF Archive they released to me for publication pictures of the fighters from Deir Yassin themselves,” she continued and displayed a series of photos showing armed Irgun and Lehi members, but no trace of the Arabs who were killed.</p> \n<p>At the Haganah Archive, where Shoshani continued her search – “like an naive child,” as she said – another surprise awaited her. “An older man came up to me, very hush-hush, took me to a side room and told me that he had taken pictures immediately after the massacre,” she said.</p> \n<p>The man was Shraga Peled, 91, who at the time of the massacre was in the Haganah Information Service. He told Shoshani that after the battle he was sent to the village with a camera to document what he saw there. “When I got to Deir Yassin, the first thing I saw was a big tree to which a young Arab fellow was tied. And this tree was burnt in a fire. They had tied him to it and burned him. I photographed that,” he related. He also claims he photographed from afar what looked like a few dozen other corpses collected in a quarry adjacent to the village. He handed the film over to his superiors, he says, and since then he has not seen the photos.</p> \n<p>Possibly this is because the photos are part of the visual material that is hidden to this day in the Archive of the IDF and the Defense Ministry, of which the state is prohibiting publication even 70 years after the fact. Shoshani petitioned the High Court of Justice about this a decade ago as part of her final project at Bezalel. Haaretz joined her in the petition.</p> \n<p>The state explained that publication of the pictures was liable to damage the state’s foreign relations and the “respect for the dead.” In 2010, after viewing the pictures, the Supreme Court justices rejected the petition, leaving the material far from the public eye. In the meantime Shoshani managed to get hold of some other photos connected to the massacre, among them a series of pictures documenting orphaned children whose parents had been killed at Deir Yassin.</p> \n<p>The Deir Yassin massacre continues to upset everyone who deals with it, even at a distance of 70 years. Not everyone agrees with the characterization “massacre.” Historian Dr. Uri Milstein, who studies Israel’s wars, does a lot to propagate the thesis that there wasn’t any massacre in the village. In many articles he has written, he claims that this is “a mendacious myth” and “a blood libel” and that the Arab dead were killed in “a battle in a built-up area.”</p> \n<p>“I don’t think that anyone there had the intention of coming there and killing children,” says Shoshani in summing up the materials she has gathered about the incident. However, she says, “This was not a battle against fighters but rather the sudden occupation of a village, in confrontation with inhabitants who defended their homes with meager means. There were also cases, apparently isolated, of mowing down inhabitants, ‘executions,’ after the fighting was over, for the purpose of deterrence and out of fear.”</p> \n<p>The Deir Yassin massacre was the first of a number of incidents in which Jewish fighters were involved in killing civilians in the War of Independence and after it was over. Another infamous incident was the one at Kafr Qasem in 1956, on the day the fighting in the Sinai Campaign began. Forty-eight Israeli Arab citizens were killed by Border Police gunfire. As in the case of Deir Yassin, the state is still censoring the archival materials from Kafr Qasem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This article was originally published July 14, 2017 amid a controversy surrounding Netanyahu's visit to Hungary and has been updated after Netanyahu's son, Yair, posted an anti-Semitic meme to Facebook criticizing George Soros.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n surely believed the run-up to their July 18 meeting in Budapest would be smooth sailing when they first announced it.</p> \n<p>After all, they have a lot in common and much to bond over. Both leaders position themselves in the center right, but over the years have had to lurch rightward to consolidate their hold on power, in the face of challenges from more extreme political parties.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Soros and Reptilians Controlling the World: Yair Netanyahu Posts Meme Rife With anti-Semitic Themes&nbsp;&lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>Their get-together, planned last December, was expected to be a refreshing change from lectures by Western counterparts over their policies – in Israel’s case, over the Palestinians and settlements; in Hungary’s, its harsh immigration policy and its troubling xenophobic tone, and harsh crackdown on political dissent.</p> \n<p>Now, like an unwelcome guest, George Soros has ruined their party planning.</p> \n<p>Instead of a harmonious lead-up to the first visit of a sitting Israeli prime minister to Hungary since the end of communism in 1989, Netanyahu’s upcoming trip has been marred by controversy. The fuss centers on Orb&aacute;n’s new and intense political campaign vilifying the Jewish billionaire – one that Hungarian Jews say has stirred up anti-Semitism in Hungary to such an extent that they implored Israeli leaders to speak out against it.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu may see himself as the leader of the Jewish people, but there are some Jews he is decidedly unenthusiastic about representing. And Soros probably tops that list.</p> \n<p>Soros was the 19th richest person in the world last year according to Forbes, reportedly worth more than $25 billion. He was born Gy&ouml;rgy Schwartz, to an upper-middle class Jewish family in Budapest in 1930. In 1944, when the Nazis occupied Hungary, the Soroses – who changed their name to avoid detection as Jews – escaped the mass deportation and murder of over half a million of their brethren by obtaining false papers that allowed them to pose as Christians. After the war ended, Soros left Hungary for England and the United States, where he became one of the world’s most successful strategic investors.</p> \n<p>He is also a deep-pocketed philanthropist, aiming his donations – and substantial political campaign contributions – in a progressive political direction. His Open Society Foundations has the mandate of advancing “justice, education, public health, business development and independent media,” and he has given away billions to pro-democracy organizations, dissident groups in repressive regimes, supported education through scholarships and support for university, anti-poverty causes and decriminalization of marijuana in the United States.</p> \n<p>Soros has been lionized by the left and vilified by the right worldwide; one side of the political map viewing his work as progress toward a more free and just world, the other – particularly on its extreme fringes – viewing him as running a devious, even satanic, effort to create a new world order.</p> \n<p>He is a favorite bogeyman of the political right, not only in Europe but also the United States. He featured in the closing ad of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, his face appearing amid accusations that “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.” According to the ad, which was criticized for striking an anti-Semitic tone, Trump was the only thing standing between this greedy cabal and innocent American citizens.</p> \n<p>But Trump’s political messaging was a single shot compared to the barrage Orb&aacute;n has launched against Soros in recent weeks. One can’t walk down a street in the Hungarian capital without encountering his face. Billboard after billboard features a picture of Soros laughing, captioned, “Let’s not let Soros have the last laugh,” underneath a headline reading&nbsp;“99 percent reject illegal immigration.”</p> \n<p>Concerned by reports from Hungarian Jews that the posters were sparking an uptick in anti-Semitism, Israel’s ambassador to Hungary, Yossi Amrani, issued an extraordinarily sharp statement last weekend. In it, he called on Orb&aacute;n and his Fidesz party to remove posters hung throughout the country that criticized Soros, saying it was fueling anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“The campaign not only evokes sad memories but also sows hatred and fear,” the statement said. “It’s our moral responsibility to raise a voice and call on the relevant authorities to exert their power and put an end to this cycle.”</p> \n<p>The statement was too much for Netanyahu. On his orders, the statement was “clarified,” to emphasize that while the condemnation of anti-Semitism remained, “in no way was the statement meant to delegitimize criticism of George Soros, who continuously undermines Israel’s democratically elected governments by funding organizations that defame the Jewish state and seek to deny it the right to defend itself.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Orb&aacute;n’s desire for a successful Netanyahu visit resulted in the announcement Wednesday that he would end the poster campaign. By the time the Israeli prime minister arrives, he promised, Soros’ face would be off the streets of Hungary.</p> \n<p>Rhetoric becomes action</p> \n<p>Orb&aacute;n has found Soros a useful foil in a political effort to keep his supporters from drifting further right to the overtly anti-Semitic Jobbik party, portraying the Jewish billionaire as an evil and dangerous security threat who, if unchecked, would flood Hungary and the rest of Europe with non-Europeans and non-Christians.</p> \n<p>In recent months, Orb&aacute;n has turned his rhetoric into action, aggressively attacking the nonprofit and civil society institutions that Soros supports. In April, his government passed a law aimed at undermining Central European University, which was founded by Soros in Budapest, in 1991, and where some 1,400 students from around the world study. But Orb&aacute;n views it as a hotbed of dissent, and his law could force the institution to close or move. The law drew condemnation from the United States and the European Union.</p> \n<p>Then, last month, Orb&aacute;n’s government passed another law restricting nongovernmental organizations that receive foreign funding. The law requires groups receiving more than $26,000 in overseas funding to register as “foreign-supported” and disclose their foreign donors.</p> \n<p>This legislation resembles a 2012 law passed in Russia that requires NGOs receiving foreign funding to register as “foreign agents,” and is also aimed at Soros. (Two Soros groups – the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation – were already declared “undesirable” and banned from Russia by President Vladimir Putin’s government in 2015 for being a state security “threat.”)</p> \n<p>One of the reasons it goes against Netanyahu’s grain to criticize Orb&aacute;n for attacking Soros is that he can certainly understand the Hungarian’s desire to strike out at Soros-backed NGOs that undermine him politically.</p> \n<p>In 2013, a right-wing watchdog group, NGO Monitor, issued a monograph called “Bad Investment,” which aimed at detailing “how Soros-funded groups increase tensions in a troubled region.” It listed what it called “problematic” Israeli groups, including Gisha, Breaking the Silence and legal rights group Adala.</p> \n<p>In August 2016, a leak of hacked documents from the Open Society Foundations included emails discussing a strategy of &nbsp;“challenging Israel’s racist and antidemocratic policies” in international forums.</p> \n<p>Soros has been a supporter of J Street since the “pro-Israel, pro-peace” organization was founded as an effort to counteract AIPAC’s influence, lobbying the White House and Capitol Hill to push for an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement.</p> \n<p>He also supports Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International – groups that regularly chastise and criticize Israeli policies.</p> \n<p>Most of the groups supported by Soros have been the targets of Netanyahu’s NGO law, passed a year ago, which mandates special reporting requirements for organizations that get most of their funding from foreign governments.</p> \n<p>Israel and Hungary’s NGO laws may both target groups that Soros supports, but they differ in a key regard. The Israeli law specifically cracks down on donations from foreign governments – not individual foreigners or their foundations.</p> \n<p>But in the midst of the controversy over Hungary, one member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, Miki Zohar, said he plans to introduce an Israeli “Soros law,” in which “any person donating to organizations acting against Israel will not be allowed to donate to any organization or nonprofit association in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Such a law would close a loophole for the Israeli right. It could try to stop donors like Soros without harming the millions that flow into right-wing NGOs and charities in Israel from individual foreign supporters – billionaire casino mogul and mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, for example.</p> \n<p>In addition to Netanyahu’s desire to placate Orb&aacute;n on the eve of their meeting, and his loathing for the Israeli groups that Open Society supports, Adelson is a key reason why the Israeli premier is positioning himself as part of the Soros-hating club.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s patron styles himself as a counterweight to Soros – particularly when it comes to the American political arena, where his tens of millions of dollars flow to Republicans who battle it out with Soros-supported candidates, most bitterly and dramatically in 2016.</p> \n<p>At a time when Adelson is rumored to be drifting away from his previously rock-solid support for Netanyahu and casting his eye rightward to Naftali Bennett, Israel’s prime minister has a strong interest in showing that he is Adelson’s ally – and, therefore, Soros’ enemy.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For more than a decade now, right wing NGOs such as Im Tirtzu and My Israel have been leading vehement campaigns against progressive philanthropies. They are enthusiastically assisted by politicians in the Likud and HaBayit HaYehudi parties.</p> \n<p>For the right, such attacks kill two birds with one stone.</p> \n<p>First, in the absence of a functioning center-left parliamentary opposition in Israel, attacks seek to delegitimize the most vocal opposition against government policies &nbsp;- those that tend to originate in civil society.</p> \n<p>Secondly, by shifting the focus to &quot;the enemies within&quot;, Israel’s right-wing leadership – de facto in power for four consecutive decades – manages to evade wide public criticism against its stagnant governance and policies. Attacking the New Israel Fund or European governments who support human rights work in Israel served as an Archimedean inflection point to discredit many dozens of their grantees, rendering all as traitors in a wholesale manner.</p> \n<p>The success of the right’s strategy has been so overwhelming that in public debates in Israel and the Diaspora today, right wingers have largely abandoned the practice of providing arguments and simply respond to challenges by arguing that their interlocutor is funded by the aforementioned ‘evil’ anti-Israeli forces and therefore not worthy of stating any claim.</p> \n<p>You’d expect that, bearing in mind this ever-expanding attack on progressive foreign aid, George Soros’ global philanthropic Open Society Foundations, which embodies the kind of support the right demonizes, would become an obvious major target.</p> \n<p>Yet, until last week, little to no attention was paid by the usual Israeli right-wing attackers to Soros or to OSF. In all probability, the reason for “sparing” Soros’ philanthropy thus far lay in the nature of their giving. Spending many millions on humanitarian causes and democracy-building around the wider Middle East, OSF’s activity in Israel specifically and in relation to it has always been limited.</p> \n<p>If Soros and the OSF were never prominent enough to merit a direct negative campaign for Israel’s diligent right wing, why now? The answer is not to be found in any of Soros’ recent actions, but rather in the shifting interests of Israel’s hard right.</p> \n<p>Underlying the official assault on Soros and his alleged support of BDS against Israel is the growing alliance of Israeli right-wingers with Europe’s radical right.</p> \n<p>It began with the disturbing welcome given by members of the Likud governing party to Austrian radical right politicians. Later on, similar ties were forged between more members of Israel’s right wing, mostly its national religious faction, and new partners in Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, the American alt-right and of course, Hungary.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>United around a shared hate of Arabs and Muslims, radical European right-wingers provided for certain Israeli politicians and activists a way out of their isolation in the international arena. In return, Israeli counterparts provided kosher certificates attesting that the foreign hardliners are not the anti-Semites they seem to be.</p> \n<p>The naked truth regarding this unholy covenant was exposed when only two days after condemning&nbsp;the Hungarian prime minister’s vicious and openly anti-Semitic campaign against Soros, the Israeli government partly retracted and joined the choir against the Jewish billionaire and his progressive operations. It took no more than a handful of angry tweets from right-wing pundits to remind PM Netanyahu that his electoral base is not against the new anti-Semites, but rather consider them their next-of-kin. The fight against anti-Semitism could be discarded in order to make room for a shared negative portrait of Soros.</p> \n<p>This move ought to be highly disturbing for anyone who believes in Israel and the Jewish project of national self-determination. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, one of Israel’s fundamental commitments was, and still is, the fight against anti-Semitism in all its guises and forms.</p> \n<p>This is not only a way of protecting Israel and its international status from quasi-diplomatic forms of hidden anti-Semitism. It is also a core element of Israeli solidarity with Diaspora Jews. Abandoning this most basic tenet of Israel’s foundational core values and mission marks a dangerous slippery slope, that adds to the escalating rift between most U.S. Jews and the Israeli governing elites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An even more concerning aspect of these new and critically near-sighted alliances between the Israeli right and ultra-nationalist powers in Europe and the U.S. touches on the Holocaust itself. European ultra-nationalists don’t only rely on the Israeli support in rewriting their countries’ role in implementing the Final Solution; they also contribute directly to the recent upsurge in anti-Semitic incidents against Jews in the Diaspora.</p> \n<p>Can it be that in order to secure support for the settlement project, Israel is turning its back to the Jewish people and their safety? Can it be that unwittingly, Israeli leaders are promoting a new and sophisticated form of Holocaust denial? These are the important questions to be asked, and not the irresponsible diversions of the nuances of George Soros’ position on Zionism.</p> \n<p>Hillel Ben-Sasson is a visiting assistant professor of Israel Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary, New York.

He had gone to an initial meeting with Iran, which was a big historic moment when the Americans entered the room with Iran, and Bill became deputy secretary of state, and early on, I said to him, ‘Do you want to keep the Iran file? You know, it’s a big deal.’ He said, ‘It’s all yours!”&nbsp;  Sherman on the Iranians:&nbsp;“Let me be really clear here: basically, in Iran there are hardliners and there are hard hardliners. We all talk about Rouhani as a moderate. He’s a very conservative cleric. So no one should have, you know, some belief that he’s going to all of a sudden open up Iran and it’s going to become a full-fledged democracy. It’s not going to happen. I have a lot of faith in the young people in Iran But if there’s change, it’s going to be a long time in coming.”  On not shaking hands with the Iranians:&nbsp;“I had a discussion with them about how I grew up in a Jewish community that had a lot of Orthodox Jews and I couldn’t shake their hands either. It was really an odd and interesting discussion.”&nbsp;  On why the U.S. didn’t focus on Iran’s behavior:&nbsp;“No deal can carry the weight of everything. This is a Rubik’s Cube that was complicated enough. So to try to pile on all of Iran’s bad behavior would have, I think, been virtually impossible as a negotiation. But beyond that, and I had said this publicly, all of the Gulf states said to me at the beginning of this, do not discuss any regional issues in side rooms. Stay only focused on the nuclear deal because you cannot discuss our future if we are not in the room, which is sensible. And then, as the deal started to look like it might get done, they all said to me, how can you do this deal without solving all the other problems. I understand both. I really do.&quot;&nbsp;  On coordinating with Israel:&nbsp;“Before and after every round, I met with, spoke with, or had a secure video conference with Israel, which provided enormous technical assistance to us.” &nbsp;  Harman:&nbsp;Wendy and I were in Israel at a security conference (INSS) right after the deal and she explained the enormous pain, personally, pain for someone who happens to be Jewish dealing with their own community, and I just think maybe you want to talk about that a little bit... &nbsp;  Sherman:&nbsp;“It was very tough and I wanted to go to Israel to this conference to speak. It was very difficult to have a community that I love and feel a part of be so against what I was doing. I knew that the technical professionals in Israel thought we did a good job and that we had improved Israel’s security. And I understood and appreciated that the Prime Minister at a political level had a different view. I never questioned the PM’s right to make that decision General [Yaakov] Amidror, who was National Security Advisor during a lot of this time, was at this conference and we hugged and kissed and we have moved forward.”&nbsp;  On Saudi Arabia, Gulf states’ warming relations with Israel as a result of the Iran deal:&nbsp;“I would urge you all to read an Op-Ed written by Phil Gordon&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Washington Post, which argues that if everybody think that suddenly there’s a kumbaya moment between the Gulf States and Israel, think again I don’t think the Gulf states have any interest in being very public about their relationship with Israel.”  Jane Harman on Middle East peace:&nbsp;“There is some reason to think that because our president views this deal between [the Palestinians] and Israel as a deal of deals that attention will be paid -- the neighborhood is now more aligned -- I am not saying totally aligned -- with Israel than it was, and there is an opportunity -- not that it will happen -- of what’s called an outside-inside solution.”  Sherman:&nbsp;“I'm not surprised that Jared Kushner had a difficult trip to the Middle East.

David Price (D-NC) about the administration’s decision to veto the appointment of former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to the role of UN head of political mission to Libya in February. “I will tell you that Mr. Fayyad is as you say, he’s very well qualified and is a good, decent person... However, “it was not about Mr. Fayyad,” Haley explained. “It’s about the fact that the U.S. does not recognize Palestine And because that is how he was presented, we did oppose that position.” Haley then confirmed that the U.S. would not support the appointment of any Palestinian individual until they are formally recognized by the U.S. as a state.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]&nbsp;  Haley testified on Tuesday that Iran has not violated the 2015 nuclear deal.&nbsp;&quot;In reference to the JCPOA, we're not seeing any violations of that,&quot; she said when speaking before the House Appropriations State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee. The former South Carolina Governor also warned Iran and Russia regarding the usage of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. &quot;That if this happens again, we are putting you on notice. My hope is that the President's warning will certainly get Iran and Russia to take a second look, and I hope that it will caution Assad,&quot; Haley explained.  Senator Feinstein ‘Regrets’ Netanyahu’s Western Wall Decision -- by Aaron Magid:&nbsp;Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) told&nbsp;Jewish Insider&nbsp;on Tuesday that she “regretted” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent move to scrap the Western Wall&nbsp;plan. “I think in this modern day of age: To say, when you have a dramatic historic artifact that has an overwhelming religious interpretation” where both men and women can’t pray together is a “mistake,” the Jewish California lawmaker noted.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]  STATE VISIT --&nbsp;AIPAC leaders to arrive in Israel for special meeting on Kotel crisis:&nbsp;The AIPAC delegation is being led by the organization’s President Lillian Pinkus and CEO Howard Kohr. Israeli officials who were in touch with AIPAC said the lobby organization is concerned that the Israeli cabinet decision on Sunday to cancel an earlier decision to build an egalitarian prayer plaza at the Western Wall could undermine support for Israel in Congress.&nbsp;“Part of the support for Israel on Capitol Hill is based on the idea that Israel is a democracy and safeguards peoples’ freedom and rights,” one official said. “The cabinet decision sends a different message.”&nbsp;[JPost]  &quot;Bibi hits a wall&quot; by David Suissa:&nbsp;“I’m a Jew first and an Israeli second,” I remember [Netanyahu] saying once at a Manhattan synagogue. Will he be able to say that next year at AIPAC, or at an American synagogue? Will anyone believe him? What American Jews are hearing today is that Bibi is an Israeli politician first and a Jew second. That is the price he is paying for appeasing intolerance. What I find especially sad about this affair is that Bibi knows how to build bridges — with non-Jews... But while he built those bridges, he allowed another bridge to fray—the bridge between his government and the Jews of the world.&quot;&nbsp;[JewishJournal]  FRIEDMAN SPEAKS: “Weighing in on Western Wall crisis, new US envoy calls for Jewish unity” by Raphael Ahren:&nbsp;&quot;Yesterday, I heard something that I thought I’d never hear before I heard a major Jewish organization say that they needed to rethink their support for the State of Israel,” Friedman said at a B’nai B’rith journalism awards ceremony in Jerusalem. “That’s something unthinkable in my lifetime, up until yesterday. We have to do better. We must do better.” Friedman admitted that in the past he has been “as guilty as anyone else of having entered the partisan divide that has unfortunately to some extent fractured the Jewish community But it has to end We have to turn the page.”  “Although organizers billed his speech as his “first policy speech since arriving in Israel,”&nbsp;Friedman did not address the Israeli-Palestinian peace process “We’re working very hard on a peace process,” he said. “There’s an expression in English: Those who talk don’t know, and those who know don’t talk. So here I actually know so I won’t talk. I don’t see any real purpose in jumping the gun on some sensitive discussions.”&nbsp;[ToI]&nbsp;  WATCH -- Friedman:&nbsp;“I will confess to you, I also read Arutz Sheva - I hope it’s okay - and I also read Israel Hayom, but I also read Haaretz. So I try to get a balanced view of what’s going on here. This is a very complicated country for such a small country.”&nbsp;[YouTube]&nbsp;  “Abbas looks to new Saudi crown prince for Mideast initiative’ by Shlomi Eldar:&nbsp;“The&nbsp;Palestinian representatives' biggest disappointment was Greenblatt, who had previously seemed to them devoid of prejudice and also efficient and determined. They had gotten the impression at the beginning of his mission that he was not easily swayed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the source said. He added, however, the combination of Greenblatt and Kushner does not bode well for the Palestinians.&nbsp;According to the source, things occasionally became so heated... that it seemed on the verge of a blowup.&nbsp;Kushner surprised the Palestinians when he hinted that there was no guarantee that Trump would insist on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations if he concluded that a diplomatic breakthrough was not a possibility Now the Palestinians have another target — Mohammed bin Salman, the man appointed Saudi crown prince June 21. The plan is to get the prince on board with their cause so he can help them right the unfair slant they see on the American team.”&nbsp;[Al-Monitor]  HEARD YESTERDAY - State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert on reports that Trump is considering to withdraw from the peace process:&nbsp;“This is something that I was involved with and on the phone with over the weekend, hearing from some of the folks who had been traveling with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt as well. And that’s just false. The President has made Israeli-Palestinian peace one of his top priorities We understand and recognize that this is not going to be a one-shot deal. It’s not going to be handled in one meeting or one trip. It is no surprise also that some meetings and conversations may be a little bit more difficult than others. Some will be more challenging. The President has said himself that it is not going to be an easy process, that both sides – the Israelis and the Palestinians – will have to give a bit in order to be able to get to a peaceful arrangement, which we hope to see. But we are not pulling out in any way, shape, or form of this as being one of our priorities.”  KAFE KNESSET --&nbsp;Interview with Tzipi Livni -- by Tal Shalev and JPost's Lahav Harkov:&nbsp;As the White House is brushing off reports which indicate that President Trump might be considering backing off from the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, former Israeli negotiator Tzipi Livni told&nbsp;Kafe Knesset&nbsp;today she believes that the President should present his own list of core principles on the table and use it to kick off negotiations.&nbsp;  &quot;This is something that Obama did not do – and it is an opportunity for President Trump. Obama hesitated. But all you need to do is present a paper with just a few sentences. Talking about where are we going. Separation from the Palestinians. Two states for two peoples. A demilitarized Palestinian state. They already agreed on it, so why not write it? Pre-1967 border lines plus swaps has already been agreed as a base for negotiations. By putting these simple principles on the table -- both leaders -- Netanyahu and Abu Mazen, would be forced to make decisions. I respect the fact that the President doesn’t want to force both sides to accept content, but he should force them to make decisions. And in the past Netanyahu and Abbas agreed to negotiate on the basis of these principles.&quot;&nbsp;Read the full interview and today's entire Kafe Knesset here&nbsp;[JewishInsider]  DRIVING THE CONVERSATION:&nbsp;“Who’s afraid of Trump?

It begins with furtive promises by Israeli authorities of asylum and work opportunities in Rwanda and Uganda. Once the Sudanese and Eritrean asylum-seekers reach Kigali or Entebbe, where Uganda’s international airport is located, they describe a remarkably similar ordeal: They meet someone who presents himself as a government agent at the airport, bypass immigration, move to a house or hotel that quickly feels like a prison, and are eventually pressured to leave the country.&quot;&nbsp;[FP]&nbsp;  &quot;What America Can Learn From Israel's Peripheral Communities&quot; by Eliana Rudee:&nbsp;&quot;According to Tamar Gil, director of resource development for&nbsp;Tor Hamidbar, an organization working to develop the Negev, the number of students who stay in the Negev after university has doubled in the past ten years. For young Israelis, moving to the periphery may be their only realistic ticket to even dream of buying a home... In the United States, young people are already beginning to move to peripheral communities in search of affordable living, but it must be followed by growth of businesses and charitable investments in order to keep them there... The development of Israel’s Negev is the perfect example of creating opportunity out of the periphery.&quot;&nbsp;[Forbes]&nbsp;  “I’m Glad the Dyke March Banned Jewish Stars” by Bari Weiss:&nbsp;“It may be wrong to read too much into an ugly incident at a single march, but Jews should take what happened in Chicago as a lesson that they might not be as welcome among progressives as they might imagine. That’s a warning for which to be grateful, even as it is a reminder that anti-Semitism remains as much a problem on the far-left as it is on the alt-right.”&nbsp;[NYTimes]&nbsp;  &quot;How Donald Trump and Roy Cohn’s Ruthless Symbiosis Changed America&quot; by Marie Brenner:&nbsp;“There was a party in the mid-1980s... [when] in walked Trump,” recounted [Cohn’s cousin David L. ] Marcus. “Roy dropped everyone else and fussed over him . . . Roy had that ability to focus on you. I felt that Roy was attracted to Trump, more than in a big-brotherly way. “Donald fit the pattern of the hangers-on and the disciples around Roy. He was tall and blond and . . . frankly, &uuml;ber-Gentile. Something about Roy’s self-hating-Jewish persona drew him to fair-haired boys. And at these parties there was a bevy of blond guys, almost midwestern, and Donald was paying homage to Roy . . . I wondered then if Roy was attracted to him.”&nbsp;[VanityFair]  RISING STAR: &quot;Alex Friedman Takes Love of Politics to City Hall&quot; by Justin Silberman:&nbsp;&quot;[Alex]&nbsp;Friedman, who was sworn in as the first Orthodox commissioner on the Baltimore City Youth Commission June 12, said he strongly believes that turning things around for the city starts with youth. In his newly appointed position representing Democratic Councilman Isaac “Yitzy” Schleifer’s 5th District, Friedman believes he is in prime position to help bring about that change. “The great thing about the Youth Commission is that our influence is as much as we want it to be,” said Friedman, who noted he loves to wear his yarmulke around City Hall...&nbsp;“I’ve always felt a responsibility to be involved with my community in any way possible,” said Friedman, who also interns for House Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) on Capitol Hill. “I have to give a lot of credit to my parents for instilling that in me.”  &quot;Friedman’s mother, Chaya, a Baltimore City Circuit Court judge, cites her husband, Howard,&nbsp;as one of their son’s biggest influences.&nbsp;Howard Friedman was president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) from 2006 to 2009, making him the first Orthodox president of the pro-Israel lobby group...&nbsp;Chaya recalls that Friedman was first bitten by the political bug when, at the age of 5, he memorized the name of every president and rattled off facts on each one. After each new election, he would get a book containing the names and background information of all 535 members Congress members.&quot;&nbsp;[JewishTimes]  &quot;Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, Who Made Jewish Prayer Books Clear to All, Dies at 73&quot; by Joseph Berger:&nbsp;&quot;Rabbi Meir Zlotowitz, who took a small wedding-invitation print shop and turned it into ArtScroll Mesorah, the leading publisher of prayer books and volumes of Torah and Talmud in the expanding Orthodox Jewish world, books notable for their easily readable typography, instructions and translations, died on Saturday in Brooklyn. He was 73... “ArtScroll made it possible for anyone to study Talmud on his or her own,” said Samuel C. Heilman, who specializes in Jewish studies as a distinguished professor of sociology at the City University of New York. The elegant ArtScroll siddur, or prayer book, used for daily Sabbath and holiday prayers is so sought after that more than a million copies have been printed. It is used even by some synagogues in the more liberal Conservative Jewish movement...&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  SCENE LAST NIGHT IN NYC --&nbsp;Mayor Bill de Blasio hosted the annual Jewish Heritage celebration at Gracie Mansion.&nbsp;De Blasio said that during a recent lunch with Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat in New York, “I reminded him of the fact that my Jewish community is larger than his Jewish community in Jerusalem. And my community is growing, and I am proud of that fact. 1.2 million Jewish New Yorkers. This is the center of the Jewish universe in so many ways.” At the event, the mayor proclaimed June 27th as the “Joe Potasnik Day” in honor of&nbsp;Rabbi Joe Potasnik, Executive Vice President of the New York Board of Rabbis.&nbsp;Israeli Consul General in New York&nbsp;Dani Dayan&nbsp;also addressed the crowd. “It’s very easy to be Jewish, it’s very easy to be pro-Israel in New York,” said Dayan.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]&nbsp;  SPOTTED:&nbsp;Assemblymembers David Weprin and Jeff Dinowitz; Councilmembers David Greenfield, Andrew Cohen and Chaim Deutsch; Michael Miller, Phil Goldfeder, David Pollock, Sol Werdiger, Malcolm Hoenlein, Galit Peleg, Avi Fink, Pinny Ringel, Captain Richard Taylor, Charles Temel, Rabbi Gideon Shloush, Stephanie Garry, Ariel Tirosh, Melissa Jane (MJ) Kronfeld, Fred Kreizman, Duvi Honig, Ezra Friedlander, Meir Laufer, Rabbi Bob Kaplan, Kalman Yeger, Yidel Perlstein, Eric post, Alicia Post, George Artz, Jason Koppel, Tali Alter, Jeff Leb, Yeruchim Silber, Josh Mehlman, Herbert Block, Inna Vernikov, Joel Lefkowitz, and Joel Eisdorfer.

        "text":["<p>We are currently witnessing a welcome boom in vegan restaurants; new ones are cropping up all over the country, especially in the center. Which proves once again that veganism is not a passing trend. It’s no secret that vegan food has a not-very-enticing reputation, but we can say with confidence that the various restaurants are working very hard to prove otherwise. They serve absolutely no animal products and still manage to surprise, offer variety and satisfy an impressive range of tastes, both for vegans and non-vegans. Sometimes the limitations give rise to the most outstanding solutions.</p> \n<p>Happy and healthy: Meshek Barzilay</p> \n<p>A 12-year-old restaurant that moved from Moshav Yarkona in the Sharon area to an impressive building in Tel Aviv’s Neve Tzedek neighborhood, this is a good place for anyone who is having trouble deciding about veganism. The restaurant serves vegan, organic, healthy and happy food, as they describe it. Either inside or out on the pleasant balcony, you can find original dishes and surprising taste combinations throughout the day – no small achievement for a place considered a pioneer of the vegan genre.</p> \n<p>Almost everything on the menu is produced on site – cheeses made from nuts, various spreads and sauces based on vegetables and legumes, crackers, outstanding desserts (don’t miss the divine pear pie) and more. There are meticulously prepared dishes such as zucchini flowers in tempura with a bean cream filling, a terrine of eggplant and peppers with vegan cheeses, gnocchi with olives, chili, vegan yogurt and nut feta, Indian and Asian dishes, vegan lasagna, veggie burgers and more.</p> \n<p>Meshek Barzilay, 6 Ahad Ha’am St., Neve Tzedek, Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Mediterranean touch: Umm Kulthum</p> \n<p>Chef Asi Delek moved with his wife, Gaya, and their three children to Haifa, and a few months ago opened the Umm Kulthum restaurant – a vegan Mediterranean chef’s restaurant with an emphasis on health. Asi, whose birth name is Hassan, uses flavors from the home-cooked Arab cuisine on which he grew up in Jaffa. On the menu you can find coexistence, with dishes such as hummus, matbukha (a spicy cooked tomato salad), shawarma made from Portobello mushrooms, vegan sinia, lentil patties, vegan lahmajoun (a flat bread topped with meat and vegetables), fresh seasonal salads, as well as pizza, couscous, stuffed vegetables, an Israeli salad and a selection of vegan desserts. Every day they serve specials concocted in the kitchen, based on Asi’s imagination and fresh foods from the market.</p> \n<p>Umm Kulthum, 60 Moriah St., Haifa</p> \n<p>Varied and up-to-date: Ludens</p> \n<p>A popular vegan restaurant that has been open for five years, Ludens is offering new dishes for the summer, along with a wide variety of classic dishes that already have a regular group of fans. The new menu includes dishes such as a burrito with seitan (a meat substitute made with wheat gluten) and guacamole sauce; a Portobello burrito, a vegan hamburger called a Buddha Burger and a “schnitzel” roll made from pieces of seitan and stir-fried with tofu and silan.</p> \n<p>The restaurant is located in the Ra’anana industrial zone and attracts hungry vegan workers from all over the area; it also offers a delivery service. The menu includes fresh salads and pastas with a variety of sauces.</p> \n<p>Ludens, 1 Hamasger St., Ra’anana</p> \n<p>A Georgian celebration: Nanutchka</p> \n<p>Any discussion of vegan restaurants must include Nanutchka – the first Georgian vegan restaurant in Tel Aviv and apparently the first of its kind in the world. It started out in the 1990s as Nana Schreier’s Nana Bar, where the happy Georgian, together with her then-partner, had patrons dancing on the tables. It later became Nanutchka and about four years ago Nana decided to change direction and adopt vegan cuisine. This was a risk because Georgian cuisine is based on meat, fish, eggs and other animal products. The gamble paid off and celebrants continue to arrive en masse, to be happy, drink, dance and eat well, too. The historic building is divided into four seating areas (a garden, a well-stocked bar, a gallery floor and an indoor seating area), where delicacies from traditional Georgian cuisine are served in vegan interpretations.</p> \n<p>You’ll find dolma – grape leaves filled with rice and herbs, roasted in the oven with raw tahini and cherry tomatoes; khinkali, dumplings made from a delicate dough with a large choice of fillings, including truffles, chestnuts, pumpkin or spinach and nuts; khachapuri; vegan pilaf and more.</p> \n<p>Nanutchka, 30 Lilienblum St., Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Neighborhood surprise: EcO Bar</p> \n<p>Nobody leaves Igor’s EcO Bar in Florentin hungry. Maybe that’s what remains from his previous career as a butcher. Yes, that’s right: once a professional butcher, Igor made a life change and decided to open a restaurant that serves aesthetic, healthful and 100 percent vegan dishes. There is a vegan Jerusalem mixed grill with soy protein, Portobello mushrooms, cauliflower, tofu, spinach, onion and garlic, with or without a tortilla (made from sprouted green spelt); various hot dishes, well-made sandwiches, salads, soups, spreads, natural juices, excellent desserts and even filling and interesting hot cereals, all in a pleasant neighborly atmosphere.</p> \n<p>EcO Bar, 21 Vital St., Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>Three branches: Tevaleh</p> \n<p>Tevaleh has branches in Kfar Sava, Tel Aviv and Rishon Letzion, all offering a healthy vegan menu that meets the strict standards of the vegan-friendly organization. At Tevaleh they serve a superb breakfast with whole wheat bread (gluten-free is also available) and a rich selection of excellent spreads, including a marvelous almond labneh and a roasted onion cream, beet tahini, green tahini, pesto and avocado. There is a rich vegetable salad; fruit salad; a delicious acai fruit bowl with fresh fruits, acai cream, home-made granola, nuts and a tasty variety of additions such as raw tahini, cocoa or berries; satisfying shakes containing a large number of superfoods such as chia, spirulina, goji berries, ginger, nuts and kale; and sandwiches including vegan sabich, seitan shawarma, burger patties, toast with vegan cheeses, salads, muesli and a large number of other healthful and fresh vegan dishes.</p> \n<p>Tevaleh: </p> \n<p>54 Weizmann St., Kfar Sava</p> \n<p>81 Rothschild St., Rishon Letzion</p> \n<p>106 Bograshov St., Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>The caf&eacute; version: Anastasia</p> \n<p>A Tel Aviv caf&eacute; full of positive vibes and strictly vegan food. They serve a rich breakfast with bread, dips, spreads, salad, a hummus flour omelet and drinks; sandwiches with fillings such as avocado, seared tofu, spreads and vegetables; vegan shakshuka, salads, soups, stir-fried foods, pastas, interesting desserts like vegan Kit-Kat, morning baked goods, pralines and so on. It’s worth studying the huge drinks menu – ranging from organic coffee to green shakes and healthy drinks such as lemon spirulina and carob ice.</p> \n<p>Anastasia, 54 Frishman St., Tel Aviv</p> \n<p>A few more worthwhile options</p> \n<p>Bana – A colorful new restaurant at 36 Nahmani Street in Tel Aviv, offering an interesting vegan menu that maintains the quality of the raw ingredients and pays a lot of respect to fresh and unusual vegetables.</p> \n<p>Goodness – a vegan diner that opened a few months ago at 41 King George Street in Tel Aviv. You will find light dishes with an American touch, such as hamburgers, tortillas, sloppy joes, sweet crepes and more.</p> \n<p>Abraham Hostel culinary tour – If you have vegan guests from abroad or want to become familiar with the vegan options in Tel Aviv, the Abraham Hostel at 21 Levontin Street offers a tour of vegan restaurants in the city.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Something new has been added to the litany of wreckage and ruin of the Netanyahu era, in the form of Israel’s relations with American Jewry. It, too, did not escape the teeth of the bulldozer relentlessly thrusting ahead, like the light-rail tunnel-digging machine that’s penetrating deep into the soil of Tel Aviv, ripping up anything worthwhile that still remains – whether it’s the delicate fabric of relations between Jews and Arabs, a free and independent media, human rights organizations, or pluralism and freedom of worship.</p> \n<p>Time and again, we rediscover that to ensure his personal and political survival, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is ready to pay a high price. Not at his own expense, heaven forbid, nor from his own pocket. This week, he took the Jewish community in the United States, which is his greatest supporter and whose representatives, leaders and lobbyists he wields like a seasoned puppeteer, and simply threw it to the dogs, without batting an eyelash.</p> \n<p>At the end of the weekly cabinet meeting which, ironically, was supposed to focus on “ties with the Diaspora,” he asked for a vote – under pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties – on the cancellation of the compromise plan for pluralistic and egalitarian worship at the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>On the same day, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation approved the “conversion bill,” aimed at strengthening the monopoly of the state-run courts for conversion to Judaism, and precluding recognition of private Orthodox conversions in the country. The new legislation will in effect rule out conversion performed by representatives of Judaism’s Conservative and Reform streams, and targets tens of thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union who live in Israel, serve in the army, pay taxes and raise children – but cannot be officially registered as Jews.</p> \n<p>Of the 10 or so ministers who remained at the tail end of the cabinet meeting, only one, Yuval Steinitz (Likud), spoke out against cancellation of the Western Wall plan and also voted against scrapping it. Steinitz spoke with passion: “This is a wretched decision,” he said. “It will cause a serious rift with the Jewish people. We agreed on a compromise, we passed it in the government – why are we backtracking? What kind of talk is this?”</p> \n<p>Another Likud minister, Yariv Levin, was sanguine. “We don’t owe them [American Jews] a thing,” he said. “They don’t live here, so they shouldn’t complain.”</p> \n<p>To which Steinitz responded: “I thought we called ourselves the Jewish state, not the state of the Israelis alone.” He expected support from others but got none.</p> \n<p>In addition to delivering a resounding slap in the face to American Jewry, the Israeli government also spat in its face. Both backpedaling on an agreed-upon compromise at the Wall that was approved a year and a half ago and got stuck, and a draconian conversion bill. This creates a break of historic proportions. A true tsunami. “We didn’t lose the Reform Jews,” one minister noted, “we lost the next F-35. And we didn’t just lose money, we lost our strategic arm in the United States. It’s important to understand: This is not just a crisis with American Jewry, it’s a crisis with the United States of America.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister could not summon up the courage to go before the cameras and explain the decision. Now that’s leadership, that’s taking responsibility – in quintessential Bibi style. Instead, his bureau sent the media a video statement from by cabinet secretary Tzachi Braverman. He looked as frozen and inauthentic as a POW with a rifle aimed at his head.</p> \n<p>“It is important for Prime Minister Netanyahu that every Jew be able to pray at the Western Wall,” Braverman declaimed from a pathetic text that gives cynicism a bad name.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu could have had himself filmed saying the same thing. It turns out that there are occasions when even he, to whom falsehood, fabrication and deception are no strangers, feels uncomfortable.</p> \n<p>Power hungry</p> \n<p>Israel’s cabinet ministers and prime minister have never looked so pathetic and cowed – like abject slaves of two Haredi parties that, in terms of their number of MKs, represent about 10 percent of the public. It’s not the Haredi politicians who should be blamed, though; it’s those who capitulate to their demands and abandon the general Jewish public in order to stay in power for yet another year and to entrench the strategic alliance with the ultra-Orthodox in advance of the next election.</p> \n<p>The leaders of Shas and United Torah Judaism, Aryeh Dery and Yaakov Litzman respectively, and their ilk, are intoxicated with power. They are resorting to extortion because they know that, thank God, there are people to extort. Ariel Sharon, the last true leader Israel had, would never have let a disgrace like this come to pass. He would have kicked that bunch out of the window and reshuffled his cabinet. But Netanyahu has given the Haredi members of the coalition everything they could have dreamed of: cancellation of the new military draft law, restoration of National Insurance allowances plus retroactive compensation, along with awarding of key ministerial portfolios and other powerful governmental posts. Give them an inch and they’ll take a mile.</p> \n<p>As mentioned, the chief victims of the religious conversion legislation will be immigrants from the former Soviet Union, most of whom vote for the Yisrael Beiteinu party. As everyone knows, that party is headed by a powerful leader. His word is his bond. Paragraph No. 36 of the coalition agreement between that man, Avigdor Lieberman, and Likud states, “Laws relating to religion and state will not be moved forward, will not be approved and will not be enacted unless they are affirmed unanimously by representatives of all the member parties of the coalition.”</p> \n<p>That’s a clause that gives him the right to cast a veto. All that Lieberman needed to do in order to torpedo the bill in the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Black Sunday was to send a representative in with a photocopy of the agreement. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked (Habayit Hayehudi), who chairs the committee, would not have put the bill to a vote, and part of the catastrophe would have been averted.</p> \n<p>But Lieberman chose not to do that, and was not present when the subject came up for discussion in the cabinet. He left a note with a “nay” vote. The next day, he convened his party’s MKs and warned that Israel was becoming a state of halakha (Jewish religious law). Theodore Roosevelt once enjoined politicians to speak softly and carry a big stick. Lieberman spoke tough, imbuing his listeners with fear and trembling, but he carried a plastic hammer. Leaving the Defense Ministry is not an option for him. He’ll prefer to stay there even if the government passes a law next week forcing all cabinet ministers to wear a shtreimel and all immigrants from the FSU to eat glatt kosher. Before Netanyahu brought up the issue of the Western Wall prayer area for discussion, along with the new conversion legislation, he first checked everything out with Lieberman.</p> \n<p>Naftali Bennett, the leader of Habayit Hayehudi, whom we saw this week at Ariel University flirting openly with Netanyahu’s former patron, American casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson, was happy to join the festivities. Bennett – whose colleague Shaked put the conversion bill to a vote and whose party shares in the sweeping capitulation to the Haredim – spotted an opportunity to differentiate himself from Likud and set in motion a sound-and-light show replete with bombs bursting in air whose tacit message was: Bibi’s a wrecker, I’m a fixer. Thereafter, he launched a marathon round of meetings with leaders of American Jewry. First with the heads of the Jewish Federations, who chanced to be in Israel when the decisions about the Western Wall and conversion were made, and then with the leaders of the AIPAC lobby, who flew to Israel urgently amid the crisis.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, too, met with select representatives of these organizations. In one meeting, he’s reported to have said that any other prime minister would have yielded to the Haredi parties and cancelled irrevocably the compromise plan for the Western Wall. “I didn’t cancel it,” the prime minister of Israel said, “I only froze it.”</p> \n<p>One visiting participant in that meeting told an interlocutor that he and his colleagues lowered their eyes in embarrassment. It was a scathing insult to them that this was the level of the argument they were hearing from a national leader. But it was classic Netanyahu: He’ll never admit genuinely that he was wrong or that he gave in, that he folded. He’ll fabricate, twist and turn, fudge and, above all, he’ll always try to persuade you that his predecessors in office would have done worse. So we need to thank him and if possible also give him a bonus. Because it’s coming to him. It’s always coming to him.</p> \n<p>Five horsemen of the apocalypse</p> \n<p>It’s no easy task for a journalist to try to make the Labor Party primary, set for next Tuesday, come alive for readers. Labor appears to be in its death throes, a brand whose time has passed. Even at such a terrible time for Netanyahu and his Likud, the main opposition party would be unable – according to public opinion surveys – to win back even one of the 12 to 14 seats it has lost to Yair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party. Why should the Labor leadership race interest anyone who’s not in the heart of that darkness?</p> \n<p>The contestants – five principal ones and three others – seem to be fighting for control of the wheel of a sinking ship. On top of which, the July 4 event is only the first round; the contest will only be decided in the second round, a week later. So the drama is of limited scope. Unless everyone is surprised and MK Amir Peretz garners the 40 percent of the votes needed for a first-round win. He claims he can do it. Others are dubious.</p> \n<p>The intriguing candidates are the current leader, MK Isaac Herzog, and the new player on the field, Avi Gabbay, who bolted from Kulanu, which he helped found. Herzog is fighting tooth and nail for his position and his honor. He’s the only one of the bunch who’s telling the party the truth: Labor alone isn’t worth more than what the polls predict for it, and if it doesn’t hook up with a bloc of parties whose members will together choose a candidate for prime minister, it won’t be relevant. A vote for Gabbay or Peretz, says Herzog in conversations with activists, will ruin the partnership with Tzipi Livni’s Hatnuah, Labor’s partner in Zionist Union. Livni has already said that in such a scenario, she would leave and dismantle the partnership, which would shake up Labor considerably. In particular, she would have a hard time being No. 2 under Peretz, who in the past was a sort of No. 2 under her.</p> \n<p>Herzog, on whose watch the party nose-dived, understands that he can’t just offer more of the same. No one will buy those wares. He has to present a new message. That message is the “bloc.” On the other hand, while the Labor faithful are seeking hope, Herzog is offering them a cloudy future. Because without Yesh Atid, there will be no bloc – and Lapid just isn’t interested.</p> \n<p>In all the internal surveys being conducted in Labor, and there are many, Herzog doesn’t come in first or even second. Many people object to him. In the last election he did exceptionally well, with Labor getting 24 seats; at times he seemed to be within spitting distance of the premiership. Now all that has been forgotten. You can’t accumulate credit in politics; only the present exists, in all its gloominess.</p> \n<p>Labor MK Yossi Yonah told me this week that in his meetings with voters, he’s hearing mainly that those who vote for Herzog will do so because they will feel bad for him if they don’t.</p> \n<p>Yonah supports Gabbay. “Bougie [Herzog’s nickname] is a people person, in the good sense of the term,” Yonah said. “That’s also true of Amir [Peretz]. The hard core, the party veterans, will vote for them. Avi [Gabbay] has no party past, for better or worse. For Gabbay to have a chance to get to the second round, he has to increase the turnout significantly. The new, uncommitted voters have to turn out in masses.”</p> \n<p>When Gabbay, who was environmental protection minister on behalf of Kulanu before leaving that party, joined Labor a few months ago, he pulled the rug out from the four MKs in the race: Herzog, Peretz, Erel Margalit and Omer Bar-Lev. He crashed their party and became the star of the event. The support for him reflects a desire to see someone new and untarnished, someone who’s not handicapped by the deficient DNA of a cantankerous, conflicted and crotchety party whose leaders are periodically flung from their seats like squash balls hurled at top speed on the court.</p> \n<p>One of Gabbay’s campaign messages is incontestable: Electing him will generate an earthquake in a party that appears about to implode from decay. Even by getting to the second round, he would inject a substantial shot of adrenaline into the last stretch of the race. But then he would have to cope with a burden that his rival can be expected to chain to him: The fact that he’s not a serving MK will prevent him from serving effectively as leader of the opposition for the rest of the current Knesset’s term of office.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy theory</p> \n<p>This week, a conference marking Cyber Week was held at Tel Aviv University. On Monday, Prof. Isaac Ben-Israel, head of the university’s Cyber Research Center, published an article in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth calling on the government to prepare itself for unconventional external cyber intervention that will undermine confidence in the country’s leadership. He cited as an example the U.S. election campaign, in which Russian hackers are thought to have intervened.</p> \n<p>The article apparently unnerved one politician. The next day, MK Yair Lapid tweeted, “I suggest establishing a team, to be headed by President Ruvi [Reuven] Rivlin, to prevent cyberattacks in elections. Because of the complexity involved, the team must report and receive guidelines from an objective body.”</p> \n<p>The meaning of this is clear: The leader of Yesh Atid, which in the polls is just about neck-and-neck with Likud, is warning against a possible conspiracy in the next election between the individual who has supervisory power over all the cyber bodies, and some other person/state/entity, with the aim of thwarting the democratic process (i.e., robbing Lapid of the premiership).</p> \n<p>The warning is seemingly not completely off the wall. What happened in other developed countries could happen in Israel, too. Recent reports in the United States suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a cyberattack in order to assist Donald Trump in his race against Hillary Clinton. Lapid might be thinking: Putin and Netanyahu are pals and have a special relationship. In the next Israeli election, it’s obvious who Putin will favor and support. Thousands of hackers will be unleashed – and God have mercy! Fake information will flood the social networks in order to sway public sentiment against a certain candidate who today offers the only alternative to Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Lapid is putting forward a substantive issue that needs to be taken seriously. What seems odd in his tweet is his recommendation for the person to head the team, whose task will be to prevent the Putins of the world from depriving Lapid of the key to the Prime Minister’s Bureau.</p> \n<p>It’s true that Rivlin is the only official personage in the country who’s state-oriented, impartial and not subordinate in any way to the prime minister. But he’s also the president of the state, and in Israel there’s a separation of powers and a governmental structure and all that blah-blah we learned in civics classes. What Lapid is suggesting won’t happen, and he knows it. His real purpose is to raise awareness of an issue that’s likely to gather momentum after a date for the next election is announced.</p> \n<p>To Lapid we can apply the well-known dictum: Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Today is the beginning of the week in which our lives begin to change. In the words of lyricist Didi Manusi’s song “60 years old:” </p> \n<p>“A big day is in the offing/ a young and new kind of day/ Ironing out wrinkles/ and erasing years/ because really, it’s not a symbol/ not a flag. The past is behind it – it’s looking to the future … in short, renewing itself/ like seasons of the year/ summer/ winter/ beloved, quarrelsome/ but deep underneath/ it’s always spring there.”</p> \n<p>It’s always spring in the Labor Party, and now it is again renewing itself like the seasons of the year. The day after tomorrow, it will be holding internal leadership elections. We are holding our breaths. Who will be chosen as leader? It’s almost like asking who will lead Israel to its new horizon. There are five leading candidates, all of them worthy. There is a deep and fascinating ideological chasm dividing them and all of them herald major change, if not a revolution. </p> \n<p>Even if the party’s current leader, Isaac Herzog, is reelected, it will be a major change, because it will be a Herzog like you’ve never known. There’s no need to waste words on what will happen if one of the others is elected. It would be like Britain’s New Labour Party. A revolution. </p> \n<p>The next leader is already warming up and peace is warming up for him in the capitals of the region. In Ramallah, they’re preparing for the signing ceremony. In the Jenin refugee camp, it’s the celebrations over the end of the occupation. In Gaza, there are plans for removal of their cage of a security fence, and in Tel Aviv, they’re decorating the streets in advance of the freedom holiday for asylum seekers. Israel is renewing itself. </p> \n<p>The left wing has come out into the light, human-rights groups have been set free and the Israel Prize is being given to Breaking the Silence. The settlements are being put on hold, nation-state laws – and the submarine purchase contract from Germany – are to be rescinded, and the money that would have gone for the submarines will be redirected to spending on public health. Civil society will come back to life, the process of nationalistic-religious control of the country will be halted and the extreme right-wing group Lehava will be outlawed.</p> \n<p>We won’t recognize Israel. All we have to do is imagine Amir Peretz, Erel Margalit, Avi Gabbay, Omer Bar-Lev and a new Isaac Herzog at the helm. Imagine.</p> \n<p>The countless interviews and the “debates” of the five candidates paint a picture that sparks the imagination. Herzog is promising a centrist bloc, Peretz a shadow government. Gabbay will divide the country into districts with a Knesset member assigned to each one. Margalit will reestablish the opposition, while Bar-Lev is promising a law that would compensate West Bank settlers who leave voluntarily. </p> \n<p>The Siha Mekomit (Local Conversation) website asked them if they see the largely Arab Joint List Knesset faction as a coalition partner in a government that they would head. Such a question is an outstanding touchstone of the candidates’ true attitude towards Israel’s Arabs and towards peace, democracy and their own fortitude. </p> \n<p>Herzog said it was not possible because of the Joint List and Peretz said it was impossible because of the “nationalistic and extremist character” that had taken over the Joint List. That “left-winger” Margalit said he would like to see “Arab representatives,” but ignored the Joint List, while Gabbay said that based on its current composition, it was impossible to cooperate with it. </p> \n<p>In other words: Each and every one of them said ‘no’ to the most significant potential partner for genuine change in Israel. Yesh Atid pary leader Yair Lapid would have put it better: “What do we need that Labor Party for?”</p> \n<p>What do we need that Labor Party for when not a single one of its future leaders says anything that hasn’t already been talked about ad nauseam? Not a single one of them dares say a thing about the crimes of the occupation, about the big elephant in the room. Not a single one of them is proposing a solution, other than proclamations from the past that have been tried endlessly.</p> \n<p>None of them have learned from their colleague, Jeremy Corbyn, the head of the British Labour Party, which was also viewed previously as the walking dead, just as our Labor Party is. Yet Corbyn suddenly transformed it into a dynamic and true ideological alternative that came close to winning last month’s U.K. election.</p> \n<p>Corbyn didn’t impersonate Theresa May and didn’t flatter the right wing. He didn’t claim to be centrist and wasn’t afraid of profane words such as “left wing.” Corbyn dared to say all of the things that the Israeli Labor Party candidates’ communications consultants would never allow them to utter. Change happened in the British elections. </p> \n<p>A big day is in the offing. Israel’s Labor Party doesn’t have a shadow of a Jeremy Corbyn. So you can doze off and vote for Yair Lapid.</p>",

        "text":["<p>STOCKHOLM – According to the regulations of the Swedish Academy, which is responsible for awarding the Nobel Prize in literature, there is complete confidentiality on all Nobel documents for a period of 50 years, and then this secrecy is lifted. And so, on January 2, 2017, at exactly 2 P.M., I arrived – by appointment – at the Swedish Academy building in the heart of the capital’s Old Town district.</p> \n<p>Together with translator Helena Isaksson, I was ushered into the spacious reading room adjacent to the academy’s Nobel Library. The ceiling above the top-story room is capped by a glass dome, allowing a little of the light that’s given so sparingly to the city at this time of year to penetrate.</p> \n<p>After a few moments, the academy’s archivist, Madeleine Engstr&ouml;m Broberg, entered the room, holding a handful of documents prepared for me in advance. Even though these were not the originals but only copies, I still held my breath: Some 50 years after awarding the literature prize to S.Y. Agnon, a few pages were exposed that could illuminate what took place in the closed, secretive rooms of the Swedish Academy when Agnon won – an event that shocked Israel’s institutions at the time because it was the first (and remains the only) time a Hebrew writer won the prize, and the first ever Nobel Prize for the young country.</p> \n<p>As an aside, I should note that the expectation of Agnon being awarded the prize had existed for decades – the issue was first raised in the Hebrew press in 1934, following the publication of an English translation of his acclaimed novel “The Bridal Canopy.” But regular lobbying to advance Shmuel Yosef Agnon’s claims to the prize began in earnest after the end of World War II, and continued until it yielded success.</p> \n<p>The institutions promoting Agnon were the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Schocken Publishing House and, eventually, the Foreign Ministry. And the leading individuals involved were Gershom Schocken, Prof. Hugo Bergmann, Simon Halkin, Baruch Kurzweil, the various Israeli ambassadors in Stockholm (Avraham Nissan, Haim Yahil, Yaakov Shimoni), and rabbis Mordecai Ehrenpreis and Kurt Wilhelm, who served at various times as the Swedish chief rabbi.</p> \n<p>Agnon had been formally suggested for the prize in 1947, 1949, 1951 and 1965. Agnon himself was aware of the efforts invested on his behalf and was not averse to lending a hand. In the winter of 1951, he answered an initiative by Rabbi Wilhelm and visited Stockholm for a few weeks with the intention of meeting with authors and intellectuals, and to be presented to the local media.</p> \n<p>The lobbying efforts ultimately achieved their aim after years of disappointment and frustration. It finally happened when Agnon was aged 78 – and in a year when his candidacy was not raised by an external body.</p> \n<p>So what do the revealed documents tell us about what took place at that eventful time?</p> \n<p>Second in 1965</p> \n<p>On February 1, 1966, the Nobel Committee for Literature, comprising five academy members headed by Swedish writer-critic Anders &Ouml;sterling, was handed a list of names of all that year’s candidates: 72 names in all. The list included leading writers in several languages, some of whom would go on to win the prize in subsequent years. The names included Samuel Beckett, Heinrich B&ouml;ll, Lawrence Durrell, E. M. Forster, Erich K&auml;stner, Robert Graves, Andr&eacute; Malraux, Alberto Moravia, Henry Miller, Pablo Neruda, Marcel Pagnol, Ezra Pound, J.B. Priestley, Arnold Zweig and, of course, Agnon and his future cowinner, Nelly Sachs. Sachs’ candidature was raised twice that year, both as an individual candidate and in conjunction with the poet Paul Celan.</p> \n<p>The committee member who proposed Agnon was Eyvind Johnson, who himself would win the prize in 1974. Johnson’s action was to a large extent a continuation of the committee’s conclusions from the previous year: In 1965, nine candidates competed for the prize, with the committee whittling it down to six: Anna Akhmatova, Mikhail Sholokhov, Jorge Luis Borges, Agnon, Sachs and W.H. Auden.</p> \n<p>In addition, the report handed to the committee members prior to the summing up by chairman &Ouml;sterling seriously discussed splitting the prize between two candidates: The names of Akhmatova and Sholokhov were mentioned as both being Russian writers, with Miguel &Aacute;ngel Asturias and Borges cited as Spanish writers, while &Ouml;sterling suggested Agnon and Sachs (he called them“the spirit of the Jewish nation in our time”).</p> \n<p>But despite his advancement of Agnon and Sachs, whose pairing seemed “more natural and persuasive” to him compared to the other suggestions, &Ouml;sterling rushed to point out the problems with this solution.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, only three of the candidates reached the final round, with the following ranking: Sholokhov first, Agnon second and Auden third. Ultimately, the academy’s forum chose Sholokhov in a meeting held in mid-October, the accepted date for choosing that year’s laureate.</p> \n<p>Agnon remained the second-placed candidate, totally separate from Sachs. Although &Ouml;sterling appreciated her poetry, he was not convinced it was superior to that of other poets of German origin. On the other hand, the committee chairman had glowing words for Agnon, which reverberated in the ears of the committee members the following year.</p> \n<p>&Ouml;sterling’s comments focused exclusively on what he called “the great philosophical novel.” He was referring to “A Guest for the Night,” which he read in a 1964 German translation and even penned an appreciative article about it in the Swedish press. &Ouml;sterling also tried to illustrate his reading list by comparing the work to Marc Chagall’s paintings and biblical lithographs, and noted that experts considered Agnon an artist of the most lofty language of modern Israel. “Agnon is a worthy candidate for the prize, without any condition,” &Ouml;sterling concluded.</p> \n<p>Fear of a gesture toward Zionism</p> \n<p>Perhaps because of the impression left by &Ouml;sterling, or his clear guidance, it was Johnson who suggested Agnon’s candidature for the prize in 1966, in order to give him another chance.</p> \n<p>Among the 1966 documents handed to me was a letter of recommendation from the renowned Swedish author Artur Lundkvist devoted solely to Agnon. Lundkvist, who would join the Swedish Academy in 1968, was known among Swedish writers as a fan of Agnon: he had published two articles in Swedish newspaper Stockholms Tidningen in which he reviewed his books that had appeared in Swedish translations (in 1963 and 1965), and even met Agnon in his Jerusalem home while visiting Israel.</p> \n<p>Following this trip, Lundkvist published a book called “The Dream in Your Hand: A Journey to Israel,” in which he devoted a whole chapter to his impressions following the meeting with Agnon.</p> \n<p>His opinion spanned over five densely packed pages, but the opening paragraph that describes the image of the writer in a completely unconventional way particularly caught the eye: “Shmuel Yosef Agnon is the great master of Hebrew literature, one whose control of modern Hebrew is greater and more perfect than anyone else,” Lundkvist wrote.</p> \n<p>“Those knowledgeable in the subject agree on this, in both Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Agnon is admired, but people are also envious of him. He is an egocentric who declares: There are no other Gods beside me! More than many others, Agnon is the prophet of our times. With an outstretched arm, he is the old man on the mountain.”</p> \n<p>The moment of truth approached: A document dated September 5, 1966 – distributed prior to the academy forum meeting scheduled for September 15 – bore the names of the 72 candidates.</p> \n<p>Only 10 of the names were new. Sachs, who would eventually become joint winner with Agnon, is only mentioned in the context of a joint prize with Celan. Both Holocaust survivors, Sachs and Celan were close friends and the eventual decision by the academy was to strain their relationship.</p> \n<p>It is interesting to note that in 1965 Sachs’ candidature was also mentioned in conjunction with the Israeli philosopher Martin Buber, who also appeared in this document as an independent candidate.</p> \n<p>The names suggested to the academy included Beckett, Auden, Agnon, Sachs, Yasunari Kawabata and Graham Greene. &Ouml;sterling rejected outright Beckett’s candidature because of his “pessimism and nihilism.”</p> \n<p>&Ouml;sterling also noted how Greene’s name had appeared repeatedly on the list, and if the academy wished to reappraise his contribution and read several of his wonderful new stories, this was the time to do so. He briefly mentioned Auden, saying his candidacy was irrelevant as his best days as a writer were far behind him.</p> \n<p>Talking about awarding the prize jointly to Agnon and Sachs, &Ouml;sterling declared: “The suggestion is to split the prize between two writers from different linguistic backgrounds consolidated in a spiritual brotherhood that carries with it the gospel of Israel in modern literature.”</p> \n<p>He noted, unexpectedly, that “if awarding the prize to both of them will be considered a gesture toward Zionism and awaken comments of a political nature, the academy can defend its decision and point to the human value within it – something that completely suits the will of Alfred Nobel.”</p> \n<p>In the end, the five candidates (Beckett was dropped from the list) were listed in the following order: First, Japanese novelist Kawabata; second Agnon and Sachs; third Greene; fourth Auden.</p> \n<p>On September 15, the academy convened to decide which writers would make it to the final round. The final decision was made on October 20 by vote. According to the archivist Broberg, even after 50 years the minutes of these meetings still remain a secret. But at the end of the meeting, &Ouml;sterling announced to the press that Agnon and Sachs were to be awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in literature.</p> \n<p>The two writers “complement each other in their wonderful aspiration to pass on the cultural heritage of the Jewish people through literary expression,” he said.</p> \n<p>It appears that the academy rejected the leading candidate, Kawabata – a move considered unusual during the selection process for a Nobel laureate; the Japanese writer had to wait until 1968 to receive the prestigious award. Beckett, who was also rejected this time, received the prize in 1969 when &Ouml;sterling still headed the committee. Greene and Auden never won the prize.</p> \n<p>From the minutes of the years 1965-1966, it appears that of the two candidates Agnon was the more certain choice, while they tried repeatedly to find a suitable candidate for Sachs to share the prize with.</p> \n<p>The solution was finally found by sharing the prize between her and Agnon.

        "text":["<p>Archaeologists have unearthed statues, elaborate mosaics and other treasures in a 1,700-year-old villa in Ptolemais, a key trading port for the ancient Romans on the Libyan coast.</p> \n<p>The artifacts and a hoard of 553 sestercii silver and bronze coins hailing back to Republican times were found in a vast building about 600 square meters in area, dating to the 3rd century C.E.</p> \n<p>Most of the coins were found inside a room inside the house where terracotta lamps were manufactured. The coins may have been the earnings of local craftsmen, said archaeologist Jerzy Zelazowski of Warsaw University.</p> \n<p>The ancient city was established almost 2,300 years ago, at the turn of the 4th century B.C.E., by ancient Greeks. Its original name is not known, but it gained the name &quot;Ptolemais&quot; during the reign of the Ptolemaic empire over Egypt.</p> \n<p>The Ptolemaic Kingdom had been founded in 305 B.C.E. by Ptolemy I Soter, whose Hellenistic dynasty ruled a vast area stretching from Syria to Nubia, with its capital in Alexandria. The Ptolemaic rulers declared themselves successors to the Egyptian Pharaohs: the famed Cleopatra was a daughter of the late Ptolemaic ruler Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos.</p> \n<p>As the power of the Romans rose, however, that of the Ptolemys waned, and they began losing territory to Macedonia and the Seleucids. Hoping to preserve what they had, the Ptolemies became vassals of the Romans. Cleopatra's father would pay the Romans through the nose in order to secure his dynasty, but after his death, Cleopatra ultimately failed to hold onto power.</p> \n<p>In 96 B.C.E. the entire province of Cyrenaica, including Ptolemais, was handed over to the Romans peacefully (400 years before the house in question was built).</p> \n<p>Rome however showed little interest in their new province, which deteriorated into a pirate’s nest. Not until the Wars of Mithradates (between the Roman Empire and the tiny Kingdon of Pontus south of the Black Sea, ruled by King Mithradates IV) &nbsp;in the 1st century C.E., did the Romans make an effort to restore order to Cyrenaica, to Romanize the locals and while about it, to resolve conflicts brewing between the Greeks and Jews living in the province.</p> \n<p>Images of the gods</p> \n<p>The villa with the recovered mosaics was built hundreds of years later around a courtyard in classic Roman peristyle arrangement. Among the loveliest of its mosaics is one depicting a sleeping Dionysus and Ariadne – a daughter of King Minos, who according to legend, would become the god's wife.</p> \n<p>Another mosaic depicts the Achillean cycle (the collection of epic poems about Achilles' adventures) representing Achilles on the island of Skyros – where his mother, fearful that he would meet his death at Troy, dressed him as a girl to avoid military recruiters.</p> \n<p>Two other mosaics in the villa, one in the courtyard and one in the dining room, bear the name &quot;Leukaktios&quot;. The name was superimposed on the stonework at a later date, possibly due to ownership change during its centuries of occupation.</p> \n<p>The villa walls bore colorful frescos, imitating marble revetments with geometric designs. Several walls are covered with figural paintings, mainly depicting various species of birds.</p> \n<p>The end of this elegant house, after centuries of occupation, was probably due to the endless earthquakes plaguing the region. Two in particular, striking in the mid 3rd-century C.E. and in 365 C.E, may have doomed the house: the treasure of silver and bronze coins were found within the destruction layers inside the house.</p> \n<p>The city of Ptolemais, however, survived. At least for a while. It would remain the capital of Cyrenaica until the year 428, when it was destroyed by the Vandals, who invaded North Africa too from their Germanic home base. Ptolemais would be rebuilt under Justinian I, the byzantine emperor from 527 to 565. But after the Arab forces razed it again in the 7th century, that would be its end.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This article was originally published on June 7, 2017 and republished after Al Franken was accused of sexual harrasment, threatening his political career.</p> \n<p>“Al Franken, Giant of the Senate,” by Al Franken, Twelve, 416 pp., $28</p> \n<p>As a reader, it’s hard to imagine liking any book coming out of Washington, D.C. these days — especially one from a partisan politician who represents the party I, from a family of diehard Republicans, grew up seeing as the opposition. But it’s hard not to like Al Franken. The junior U.S. Senator from Minnesota, who spent more than two decades as a “Saturday Night Live” writer and star, manages both to entertain in his new memoir and prove himself a credible thinker and opposition leader for the Trump era. And he does all this without ever wading too deep into divisive political rhetoric.</p> \n<p>Well, to be fair, Franken calls Donald Trump a “lying liar” (in a nod to one of his previous books “Lies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right”), refers to Ann Coulter as “this thing” and explains why everyone in the Senate hates Ted Cruz, calling the former presidential contender a “sociopath.” &nbsp;So, obviously, Franken’s book does hit the right, or at least far-right, pretty hard.</p> \n<p>While Franken roasts many of his political opponents, Trump in particular, he also describes his one-time friendship with Jeff Sessions, a former Senate colleague and now the controversial attorney general. It’s hard to demonize someone “whose wife knitted your grandson his favorite binkie,” writes Franken. He also offers a lighthearted and kind assessment of George W. Bush’s comedic stylings, and recalls how they bonded over a love of comedy and a lack mutual respect. Bush joked that Franken was his favorite “SNL” comedian and Franken replied, just like “you are my favorite president.”</p> \n<p>He explains his desire to work across the aisle, which, coupled with his own self-deprecating tone and constant humor, manages to keep the book above petty politics. The same couldn’t be said about some of his previous books, including 1996’s “Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.”</p> \n<p>Franken writes that his journey to the Senate is the story of how, “after spending a lifetime learning to be funny, I learned how not to be funny.” He goes on to explain what it has taken for him to “dehumorize”—including cutting the “Jew jokes” out of his repertoire—in order to become a politician. Franken recounts the story of how he wanted to write a note to a constituent on her 110th birthday saying, “You have a bright future,” but his staff talked him out of it.</p> \n<p>He confronts head-on the fact that leading Senate Democrats like Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer didn’t want him to run, his past drug use and the many comedy sketches he was a part of that make perfect “oppo amo” in a political campaign (including jokes about rape and porn). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like any good memoir, Franken gives an account of his life, and about a behind-the-scenes look at how he got to where he is today. Franken recounts how he met his wife, Franni, (complete with Tinder and Grindr jokes), how he disappointed his practical German Jewish parents by becoming a comedian and why he decided to go into politics. He describes how, in his first bid for the Senate in 2008, after winning in a recount by just 321 votes, he kept his head down and tried to rise above his colleagues’ low expectations.</p> \n<p>Franken was raised in the largely Russian and Jewish St. Louis Park, a first-ring suburb of Minneapolis, which was also the setting of the Coen brothers’ 2009 film “A Serious Man.” He describes his close-knit nuclear family, growing up in the 1960s, sitting around their TV-tray dinners watching Walter Cronkite, and recalls his father commenting on “Southern sheriffs turning fire hoses, dogs and nightsticks on demonstrators,” saying, “No Jew can be for that!” And how his father went from being a Republican, like he was at age 13, to a Democrat in 1964 when Barry Goldwater, “a guy who had voted against the Civil Rights Act,” won the Republican nomination.</p> \n<p>When tackling today’s Republicans, including those who seem opposed to civil rights (Trump), and the gridlock in Washington, Franken always remains optimistic, even after attending Trump’s inauguration. “Trump’s fans seem to feel that he is making the dull reality of politics more fun and interesting by augmenting it with gross exaggeration, and often utter fantasy,” Franken writes.</p> \n<p>While he slams right-wing media including Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart for creating a situation where a “liar” like Trump can end up in the Oval Office, Franken mostly treats Trump supporters respect, diagnosing their support as mostly temporary. Instead, while joking he may just be “farting in the wind,” he insists that a return to truth and basic decency is inevitable as “national gullibility is a cyclical phenomenon.” Franken’s most famous “SNL” character, Stuart Smalley, hosted a self-help show featuring “Daily Affirmations,” and it’s clear that character’s need for positive thinking came from somewhere genuine in Franken.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Despite his optimism, Franken is still fighting the same battle he fought to get elected—to prove he's more than just a comedian. He recalls how focus-group participants said they &quot;didn't think the fact that I had been a successful comedian meant that I was intelligent.” He also quips that that, in his case, it was one of the first times that reminding people he went to Harvard was a good idea.</p> \n<p>The book has already garnered attention for some of its more bombastic parts, like where he says, &quot;You have to understand that I probably like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz.&quot; (Cruz responded in the press by calling the book &quot;obnoxious and insulting.”)</p> \n<p>However, the book’s best parts are not the ones making headlines; they are the parts showcasing Franken’s enduring belief in American democracy. He writes about how his constituents keep him focused and motivated no matter how “obnoxious a procedural delay or how jaw-droppingly terrible a Trump tweet.” His fond memories and the inspiration he draws from his “friend and political hero” Paul Wellstone, the beloved Minnesota senator who was killed in a plane crash, feel heartfelt and leave the reader believing that Franken’s intentions are pure.</p> \n<p>Franken has now joined a long list of U.S. Senators who have published books while in office. These often serve as a launching pad to higher office or at least a bigger national profile. Barack Obama’s 2006 book, “The Audacity of Hope,” did both. However, the tradition goes back at least as far as John F. Kennedy’s “Profiles in Courage” (1957), even if it was famously ghostwritten. While Franken may have had help with his book (as is the case with most political memoirs in the U.S.), it certainly smacks of authenticity. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Recently, Franken was asked by a morning-show host if he wants to be president, to which he quickly replied, “No, I want to be a five-term senator.” That may sound genuine enough, but in Washington, you never know.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked has asked Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit to investigate the spokesman of Breaking the Silence, Dean Issacharoff, who claimed that he had beaten an Arab prisoner in front of his soldiers during his army service in Hebron. Shaked’s demand is clearly political in nature. Her purpose is to investigate an organization against which she is waging an ideological campaign. As a politician she is permitted to demand the activation of the judicial and investigative apparatus against her political rivals, but as justice minister she is crossing a red line and is undermining the rule of law.</p> \n<p>Shaked isn’t even trying to hide the political nature of her request, which was made in the context of the battle by right-wing groups against Breaking the Silence, and is an effort to portray an allegedly discriminatory attitude toward soldier Elor Azaria, who shot a wounded terrorist to death in Hebron. In an interview with Army Radio on Wednesday, Shaked said that if Issacharoff is telling the truth, he should be prosecuted, to show that Israel takes the crime he committed seriously. If, on the other hand, Issacharoff was lying, as soldiers who say they were present during the incident assert, the state should announce that the claim is baseless.</p> \n<p>Either way, Shaked wants to enlist the police and the prosecution for her needs, whether it’s to keep up the false impression of an enlightened occupation, in which beating a prisoner is considered an exception, or to undermine the reliability of Breaking the Silence, against which Shaked and her colleagues have declared war.</p> \n<p>Shaked’s demand seeks to create a deterrent effect that will silence critics. Even if Issacharoff is not prosecuted for publicizing his action, the rest of those special individuals who get up the courage to talk about what they did in the army will learn that at some point they too could be investigated and perhaps punished. Thus Shaked hopes to gradually silence one of the few sources that independently report on the Israel Defense Forces’ conduct in the territories, whose version of events is not dictated by special interests or public diplomacy considerations.</p> \n<p>Issacharoff’s complaints, like those of other Breaking the Silence witnesses, are intended to shine a spotlight on the injustices of the occupation and the harm the occupation does to IDF soldiers. If they are to be investigated, then the IDF should be responsible for that, not the civilian bureaucracy, which is liable to be influenced by the politicians. Shaked’s dangerous recommendation will bring Israel closer to countries whose law enforcement is used as a mechanism of darkness to cover up the regime’s injustices and advance its goals.</p> \n<p>The struggle against the occupation, like every struggle against institutionalized injustice, sometimes exacts a high price from those who wage it. Issacharoff and Breaking the Silence should be supported for their willingness to pay this price and praised for their principled stance against the forces trying to silence them.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz's lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

I didn’t know what to do. I was going to threaten him, but he doesn’t speak Hebrew, I don’t speak Arabic, so I grabbed him by the neck and started kneeing him in the face and chest until he was bleeding and dazed.”</p> \n<p>In an interview with Army Radio today, the justice minister said, “The spokesman of Breaking the Silence stands up and says that he himself committed a crime against a Palestinian and needlessly beat on him. If that is really what happened, he should certainly be investigated and punished. If it didn’t happen, as soldiers who were under him say, the state needs to officially declare that it didn’t happen.” Shaked added that in other instances, organizations like Reservists at the Front and My Israel have “been able to refute the lies that he spreads.”</p> \n<p>In early May, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman had called upon Shaked to launch a criminal investigation against Issacharoff, writing, “The things that were said in the video are very grave and require an investigation – either the officer is admitting to having committed a serious crime, or else he is telling a made-up story that supposedly took place before his commander and other soldiers, and is thereby tarnishing the reputation of the IDF and of his military comrades.” Lieberman pointed out that the video was getting a large number of views, and urged that the matter be investigated quickly.</p> \n<p>In response, Breaking the Silence said the testimonies it publicizes “depict the use of violence against Palestinians as an inseparable part of the occupation regime, with the aim of exposing the immorality of ruling over millions of people in the territories. If the justice minister believes that with a hypocritical attack on the testimony of one Breaking the Silence activist she will succeed in deterring soldiers from testifying about and opposing the occupation, she is greatly mistaken. There is only one way to stop us, and that is to end the occupation.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Were most of the fires that broke out across Israel last week caused by arson, perpetrated by terrorists, or simply the result of hot, dry air and strong winds?</p> \n<p>As it turns out, that isn’t just a question for the police and the Shin Bet security service. The decision has consequences for the national budget, the public image of both Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and the insurance companies and for the household finances of the victims, which all goes to explain why the Israel Tax Authority declared that most of the blazes were caused by politically motivated arson, long before the experts completed their investigations.</p> \n<p>The Fiscal Angle</p> \n<p>The compensation that homeowners will be getting from the government won’t be coming out of the state budget, which the Finance Ministry guards jealously. Instead, it comes from a dedicated Property Tax Fund, which is entitled to 25% of all the taxes collected from real-estate transactions.</p> \n<p>The fund is there to compensate homeowners, businesses and local governments for damage resulting from war and terrorism and was last put to use after Operation Protective Edge in 2014. It currently has around 8.3 billion shekels ($2.2 billion), after being topped up by some 1 billion shekels last year. And it’s due to get another 1.7 billion shekels this year.</p> \n<p>The big increase in the balance is due to the sky-rocketing value of property in Israel and the concomitant rise in tax collection. But the treasury decided to disburse the money in advance. One reason was to make sure the fund has reserves ready for the next, inevitable war. Another was to keep the billions out of the hands of politicians, who might be tempted to use it elsewhere. In any events, the more than 1 billion shekels that will be paid out as a result of the fires will not affect the state budget.</p> \n<p>The Humanitarian Angle</p> \n<p>The decision by Moshe Asher, the Tax Authority chief, to issue a list of communities whose fires were caused by arson, will save a lot of families a lot of grief. It means that homeowners without insurance coverage will receive compensation from the government, albeit less than they would from private insurance.</p> \n<p>The police accused the taxman of rushing to conclusions, but the fact is that a full investigation of the fires will take a long time, during which hundreds of people whose homes were destroyed or damaged would get no money to pay for the repair work or lost property. Those with private insurance would have to wait as well.</p> \n<p>Being a nice guy, however, has its moral hazards. After the 2010 Carmel Forest fire, the government set a new precedent under which it paid out compensation to victims even though there was no issue of arson and it was under no obligation to do so.</p> \n<p>Only 74 homes were damaged, and only 10 had no insurance coverage at all, but officials were careful to structure the program to make sure the state’s involvement didn’t deter people from buying coverage in the future. Those with no insurance got lower rates of compensation than those who had at least some insurance.</p> \n<p>This time, however, the government will pay the same rate of compensation to everyone — a generous but perhaps unwise decision.</p> \n<p>The Political Angle</p> \n<p>Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon has cultivated an image as the friend of the middle class and the poor, which is why he has cut taxes and focused so much of his attention on reining in housing prices and cracking down on the banks. Media coverage of homeless families waiting to be compensated by the state wouldn’t be helpful, and so he acted quickly to make sure the money would be paid out.</p> \n<p>In a meeting with insurance executives on Tuesday, Kahlon and his deputy Moshe Cohen also won the consent of the insurance companies to pay out compensation to policyholders even though under the terms of the contracts they are exempt from covering damage from war or terrorism. Now Kahlon and Cohen can also claim a victory for policyholders.</p> \n<p>The Business Angle</p> \n<p>But why did the insurance companies agree to make the payouts? For one, because they are as image-conscious as the finance minister and didn’t want days of media coverage of homeless families pointing the figure at their insurance company for getting out of compensating them.</p> \n<p>In any case, they agreed only to pay the difference between the Property Tax Fund payment and what they would have paid to policyholders, which doesn’t add up to a lot of money for them.</p> \n<p>There’s also the possibility that they made a deal with the treasury: Declare the fires a result of politically motivated arson, which will save the insurers the cost of making a full payout, and in exchange they agreed to voluntarily cover the difference.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The title of Haaretz’s May 29 editorial was&nbsp;“Listen to Abbas.”&nbsp;I want to join this call. Listen very carefully. It’s a good idea.</p> \n<p>Thus did the editorial quote the Palestinian Authority president: “There’s no stronger voice than the voice of a just and comprehensive peace, just as there is no stronger voice than that of the right of people to self-determination and freedom from the yoke of occupation. The time has come to live, you and us, in peace, harmony, security and stability.</p> \n<p>“The only way to end the dispute and the struggle against terror in the region and in the world is the two-state solution based on the June 1967 lines, Palestine alongside Israel. We have accepted the UN resolutions; we have recognized the State of Israel and agreed to the two-state solution, and the world has also recognized the Palestinian state. The time has come for the State of Israel to recognize our state and end the occupation. We are still extending our hand in peace.”</p> \n<p>These remarks, the editorial stated, express “in the clearest, sharpest and most precise terms not only the Palestinian people’s desire for peace, but that of every peace-seeking Israeli citizen who wants to live in a normal country.”</p> \n<p>Really? The first thing that is not clear, sharp or precise is what Mahmoud Abbas means by “two states.&quot; For indeed, he is very careful to use the term “two states” but not “for two peoples.” Thus, he has no problem recognizing the “right of people to self-determination and freedom,” but not to recognize Israel as the state in which the Jewish people realizes its right to self-determination.</p> \n<p>Because the Jews are not a people in his eyes, the two states that Abbas refers to are a national Palestinian state and another state called Israel, to which “the refugees” will eventually &quot;return.” There will thus be two states west of the Jordan river: one theirs and the other – also theirs.</p> \n<p>Abbas indeed knows from experience that it is sufficient to wrap this hostile position in a few terms that have a friendly ring – peace, harmony, June '67 borders, etc. – so that well-meaning Israelis will hasten to interpret them according to their own wishes, ignoring everything else he says, allowing him to blur the fact that the Palestinians have refused every serious proposal put before them.</p> \n<p>They turned a cold shoulder to Ehud Barak, to the Bill Clinton parameters, to Ehud Olmert’s offer and to the efforts of Condoleezza Rice, as well as to offers by John Kerry and Barack Obama. The last offer gave the Palestinians another chance to prove that they seek peace and love harmony, and that Israel under Benjamin Netanyahu is the real obstacle to peace. Even Yossi Beilin called on Abbas to change his ways and to accept Kerry’s fair framework for a deal. He has yet to do so.</p> \n<p>So maybe we should take the editorial’s recommendation and really listen to Abbas. Last month, for example, during his visit to India, he gave a speech marking 69 years of the &quot;Nakba.&quot; The left-wing press made no mention of this speech. No one on the left said then that we should listen. A shame, because while Abbas’ words of peace are not clear, sharp or precise, but rather intentionally misleading, his repeated remarks about the holy right of return and the martyrs and terrorists are actually surprisingly clear.</p> \n<p>Abbas repeated in his speech in India that he would agree to accept “an independent state with full sovereignty within the&nbsp;June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.” He added: “Peace is our strategy, but not at any price.”</p> \n<p>Recognizing two states for two peoples is apparently not part of the price he is prepared to pay, as indeed the &quot;Nakba&quot; – an injustice that, in his words, “began over 100 years ago with the appearance of Zionist with its false vision” – isn’t over, according to him. The &quot;Nakba&quot; continues, and the way to fix the injustice is to turn back the hands of time.</p> \n<p>Britain should apologize to the Palestinians for the Balfour Declaration, Abbas said, and we all must recognize the “right of return” of (the descendants of) the refugees. “Our people will not leave behind the issue of the Nakba until all their legitimate national rights are recognized, without exception – and first and foremost, the right of return,” he declared.</p> \n<p>Because we translate so little of the Palestinians' remarks, and so selectively, Hebrew readers are liable to mistakenly think that recognizing the “right of return” is a symbolic matter that can be solved after we agree to accept a limited number of “refugees.” However, this is definitely not what Abbas means. Indeed, he thinks he is not authorized to give up the “right” in the name of the “refugees.”</p> \n<p>“The right of return,” as he has previously explained, “is a personal decision. What does that mean? That neither the Palestinian Authority, nor the state, nor the PLO, nor Abu Mazen” – yes, he is referring&nbsp;to himself – “nor any Arab leader has the right to rob anyone of the right of return.”</p> \n<p>It is enough, therefore, that we recognize the principle of &quot;the right of return&quot; to create a situation in which every “refugee” individually will be able to chose, according to UN Resolution 194 (to which Abbas has repeatedly sworn allegiance) between compensation and “return.” And who wouldn’t want to make use of such an entry gate, leading from the hell of Syria or Lebanon, or from the poverty of Jordan, directly into the first world of Zionist “apartheid?</p> \n<p>If we indeed begin to listen to Abbas, methodically and over time, we will discover that he is not preparing himself for any compromise. To the contrary, he is providing economic incentives for terror in the form of benefits to the families of terrorists. He praises the “martyrs” and names schools after them, and disseminates vitriolic anti-Semitism in the school system and his press.</p> \n<p>Thus, instead of basking in quotes from selective reports carefully chosen to conceal what we don't want to see, we had better look reality in the eye: anyone who strives to end the occupation, who wants to offer a realistic alternative to the Netanyahu government, cannot offer peace. The vast majority of voters will not buy this. Rightly so.</p> \n<p>The realistic alternative to Netanyahu is managing the conflict toward a horizon of separation, instead of the creeping expansion of the settlement enterprise that the right offers. These are the two alternatives, and we have to choose the lesser of two evils among them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the span of just a few short hours, two unprecedented developments occurred in the Syrian civil war on Sunday. One: A U.S. warplane shot down a Syrian air force jet after it struck positions of American-supported rebels. Two: Iran fired medium-range ground-to-ground missiles, ostensibly at Islamic State targets in Syria, in response to ISIS’ double terror attack in Tehran last week.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; UPDATE: Iran's Missile Attack on Syria Failed: 5 Missed, 3 Landed in Iraq</p> \n<p>The war in Syria, which has now lasted longer than World War II, continues to metamorphose. The only thing that stays the same is that Syria remains an arena for regional and world powers fighting over status, image and influence.</p> \n<p>Just two years ago, the regime of Syria's President Bashar Assad was tottering on the brink. His rule was saved by a Russian military intervention. Retaking Aleppo last December also enabled Assad to gradually regain control over other areas. (Though it seems that later on, a sticking point arose between Damascus and Moscow. Assad wanted more Russian help in order to advance faster, but Putin did not oblige.)</p> \n<p>Two other processes are also happening at the same time: After a long delay, an international coalition began attacking Raqqa, the capital of ISIS' declared caliphate in northeast Syria; and Iran took advantage of the militant group’s retreat and entrenchment in Mosul to try to unite areas controlled by Shi'ite militias in west Iraq with areas controlled by Assad in east Syria.</p> \n<p>However, Sunni organizations trained and financed by the United States are sitting in the middle, on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and they’re in Iran’s crosshairs. That is why there have been so many clashes in recent weeks in the vicinity of al-Tanf in southeast Syria.</p> \n<p>The incident involving the downed Syrian fighter jet happened by the border, but closer to Raqqa. As far as the Americans are concerned, while they’re busy fighting against the Islamic State, Assad – who should also have an interest in defeating ISIS – is taking advantage of the opportunity to snipe at rebel organizations that the U.S. supports.</p> \n<p>The Iranian missile fire on ISIS should be seen as a demonstration of power, a signal by Tehran to the Americans, Russians and also the Israelis that Iran is prepared to escalate the gamble in Syria in order to protect what it has already invested in defending its strategic interests there: support for Assad and establishing its influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Now the U.S. has also become caught up in this tension, without precision planning and perhaps without giving it enough thought. The Trump administration has no policy for Syria beyond being prepared to act more assertively than Obama did when America’s might is challenged. Thus, Trump approved the Cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base two months ago, after Assad used chemical weapons in Idlib province, and Americans shot down a Syrian jet on Sunday. Trump seems not to know or care about the details. Last week he relegated the responsibility for another arena, Afghanistan, to the Pentagon, which now gets to decide how many troops are needed to strengthen the forces there.</p> \n<p>Americans are always worried about mission creep, as happened in Vietnam in the 1960s. The concern is that tactical decisions, mainly made to defend specific interests here and there, will ultimately bog America down in a major war that it doesn’t want. With Trump, this is a real possibility.</p> \n<p>As in the previous years of the Syrian civil war, Israel is not getting directly involved, but important things are happening closer to home. Assad's regime is concentrating a lot of forces on attacking the town of Daraa in southern Syria, by the Jordanian border. Israel worries that in time, Assad’s forces could turn west toward the Syrian Golan, which in recent years has been controlled mainly by Sunni rebel groups. Israel has already warned that this is a red line, and says it will act to stop Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard from joining Assad's forces on the border.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has been broadly supporting local militias near the Golan border, paying salaries and aiding with arms and ammunition. The stated purpose is to establish a buffer that keeps the Assad regime and its supporters away from the border. Israel has always called the aid to the rebels humanitarian and says it amounts to supplying drugs, food and clothing to residents, and in giving medical care to the wounded and sick. But Jerusalem hasn’t bothered to deny the new reports, which could indicate that the gamble at stake, not only on the Syrian-Iraqi border but in the Golan too, continues to increase.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Dean Issacharoff, the spokesman for Breaking the Silence, described how he beat an innocent Palestinian in front of his soldiers during his army service in Hebron. “If this indeed happened, he should be investigated and punished,” responded Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked in an interview with Army Radio on Wednesday. “If it didn’t happen, then the state should say officially that it didn’t happen.” She asked the attorney general to investigate Issacharoff.</p> \n<p>If it did happen, will Shaked declare that Breaking the Silence – which gathers anonymous testimonies from Israeli soldiers about their service in the occupied territories – is a credible organization? Will the government stop persecuting human rights groups?</p> \n<p>Shaked’s demand poses a challenge for the organization, whose credibility is constantly being questioned by its opponents. The minister laid a trap for Breaking the Silence: If they’re credible, they should be called to account for the actions to which they have confessed. And if they’re lying, Breaking the Silence is a dubious organization.</p> \n<p>But Shaked’s gambit is liable to prove a double-edged sword, since it’s effectively an admission that Breaking the Silence is a credible organization. When she threatens to prosecute Issacharoff on the basis of his own confession, she is basically acknowledging his credibility.</p> \n<p>It’s almost tempting to propose that Issacharoff and Breaking the Silence pick up the gauntlet thrown by Shaked and the right and say, “Go ahead! Let’s see the state prosecute soldiers from Breaking the Silence who ‘confess’ to crimes.”</p> \n<p>It would be hugely ironic if the most right-wing justice minister in Israel’s history were to lead a process of putting Israeli soldiers on trial for war crimes. But it would also amount to a serious escalation in opposition to the occupation.</p> \n<p>Until now, the organization has effectively said that though its soldiers testify to war crimes, these are crimes that, in a sense, enjoy legal immunity because the occupation requires these crimes – and the occupation was forced on the soldiers.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Shaked believes that if the state starts indicting soldiers from Breaking the Silence on the basis of their own testimonies, the personal price they will be required to pay will be so great that not enough people will agree to pay it. But what will the state do if it turns out lots of people are willing to pay the price?</p> \n<p>In a sense, this same “immunity” is being demanded by the defense lawyers on behalf of soldier Sgt. Elor Azaria, who was convicted of manslaughter after shooting a supine Palestinian assailant last year. Basing themselves on the testimonies of human rights organizations, the lawyers are arguing selective enforcement: everyone does it, but only Azaria was put on trial. Again: Human rights organizations are liars, but their testimony is credible enough that a criminal defense can be based on it.</p> \n<p>Following the 2014 war in Gaza, B’Tselem stopped cooperating with the military justice system over human rights violations in the territories. Not only is there no benefit to such cooperation, said the organization’s executive director, Hagai El-Ad, but it actually does harm, because it grants the system a credibility it doesn’t deserve.</p> \n<p>El-Ad saw damage in the state reaping a public relations benefit in terms of the image of its army and justice system. But it now turns out there’s a legal benefit as well: The testimony and data collected by human rights organizations about violations in the territories are being used by defense lawyers in soldiers’ trials.</p> \n<p>Human rights organizations that were established to protect Palestinians against violations of their rights have stopped cooperating with the authorities because they feel that doing so betrays their original mission. Ultimately, though, they find themselves cooperating in defending the aggression of Israel Defense Forces soldiers. What is going on here?</p>",

        "text":["<p>The oldest known harbor in the world has been discovered by archaeologists diving off Egypt's Red Sea coast at Wadi el-Jarf. The site was found near a huge archive of papyri – which is also the oldest known to date, and which describe how the harbor was built and used by the great King Cheops to import materials to build his flagship monument, the Great Pyramid of Giza.</p> \n<p>The monumental harbor discovered under the waves at Wadi el-Jarf has been dated to 4,600 years ago, right in Cheops' time.</p> \n<p>Cheops, also known by his Egyptian name Khufu, reigned from 2580 to 2550 B.C.E. He had the harbor erected 180 kilometers south of Suez, in the foothills of the desert mountains.</p> \n<p>The site is nowhere near Giza: it seems it served mainly to import relatively lighter copper and minerals, which were used to manufacture the tools that were employed to build the pyramid.</p> \n<p>The mere fact of the monumental harbor's existence gives us insight into the efficiency of the administration and its ability to organize highly complex logistical operations nearly five millennia ago, says Prof. Pierre Tallet of Sorbonne, the head of the excavations.</p> \n<p>Riches in the Sinai</p> \n<p>The area of Wadi el-Jarf was first identified as being of interest in 1823 by the British explorer Sir John Gardner, who noted the rock-hewn galleries in his diary. &nbsp;Now marine archaeologists from the French Institute of Archaeology in Cairo and Sorbonne University have discovered the monumental submerged harbor complex built by Cheops.</p> \n<p>Over the millennia, the ancient Egyptians traded briskly with peoples around the region, operating from coastal towns on both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. (Ancient Egyptian wares have been found as far north as Scandinavia, but could have reached there through middlemen in Europe.)</p> \n<p>King Cheops himself was not only a great pyramid builder but evidently also a great businessman, trading along the Canaanite coast up to Byblos (today in northern Lebanon), and inland to the Sinai Desert and Jordan. The ancient Egyptians may have built the harbor to secure their supply of strategic resources, such as copper and turquoise, which were mined in the southern Sinai.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Indeed, the entire history of pharaonic Egypt was inextricably linked with use of boats and ships.&nbsp; Sail boats augmented with oars could travel 80 kilometers in a day, convenient not only for trade, but to quickly deploy troops.</p> \n<p>Among the astounding discoveries beneath the waves at Wadi el-Jarf was a monumental 200-meter long L-shaped pier built of large limestone blocks. The pier also functioned as a breakwater, offering sheltered anchorage for the boats moored within.</p> \n<p>The diving archaeologists discovered 22 limestone ship anchors in situ in the mooring area, which probably fell off ships, since no wrecks have been found. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Several large storage jars lying on the seabed next to the anchors were also found underwater.</p> \n<p>In addition to dock structures, the archaeologists also discovered several pottery kilns, attesting to local ceramic production.</p> \n<p>Thousands of locally made globular storage jars were found everywhere throughout the site – and also on the opposite bank of the Suez Gulf, at the Egyptian coastal fortress of Al-Markha. The fortress protected Egyptian trade in Sinai and was evidently supplied with provisions from the harbor.</p> \n<p>Enviably efficient administration</p> \n<p>Next to the wharf, the archaeologists found the remains of large stone structures, measuring 30 meters long by 8 to 12 meters in width. Tallet postulates that these were administrative centers for the port's operations, and were also used to store material and foods for the miners working in Sinai. They may have also provided accommodation to teams briefly staying on the coast.</p> \n<p>Between two of these structures, the archaeologists found a deposit of 99 stone anchors, some of which still had ropes attached. A significant number bore inscriptions in red ink with the name of the boat to which they belonged. That is truly an impressive level of organization for nearly 5,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>The galleries hewn from the rock where the papyri were found lie six kilometers from shore. The tunnels carved into the hill average three meters in width and 15 to 20 meters in length, though some galleries were over 34 meters long. &nbsp;Each gallery was narrowed by a series of large blocks of limestone and was finally sealed by a last block, arranged as a sort of gate.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The galleries were used for storage, from oars to tools to food and water supplies: Three of the galleries were crammed with several dozen large locally made storage jars, which probably served as water containers.</p> \n<p>Most of the jars were inscribed with destinations, also in red ink, and the upper parts of each pot bore the name of the work team to which it belonged.</p> \n<p>The excavators postulate that the galleries also served to store boat parts, based on the discovery of hundreds of pieces of wood, fragments of oars, and sections of ropes found inside. Among the wood bits were long wooden hull boards cut from logs of cedar from Lebanon, further evidence of the ancient Egyptians' long-distance trading in the 2nd millennium B.C.E..</p> \n<p>Factory for boats?</p> \n<p>Tallet goes one further. He is convinced that the galleries were not only used to store these parts but also for reassembling ship kits that were transported over the desert roads to the Red Sea.</p> \n<p>His theory is supported by the discovery at a different pharaonic harbor, Ayn Sukhna, some 120 kilometers up the coast, by the same archeologists a few years ago.</p> \n<p>At Ayn Sukhna, which is also believed to have been connected with the mining operations in Sinai, two complete boats (which however were burnt in antiquity) were found inside the rock-hewn galleries.</p> \n<p>“Ayn Sukhna probably replaced Wadi el-Jarf,&quot; postulates Tallet. &quot;We can determine that Jarf was probably closed at the end of the reign of Cheops, and that Ayn Sukhna was opened about 10-15 years later, under the reign of Khaefre, his second successor. Ayn Sukhna is closer to the administrative city of Memphis, which is probably the reason why it was finally selected. Jarf was in use only for a few decades, but Ayn Sukhna was regularly used by the Egyptian for more than a thousand years.&quot;</p> \n<p>Possibly, Jarf's use was intermittent, Tallet speculates: it might have only been used for expeditions to secure a supply of natural resources. “In between expeditions, sometimes for years, the place would be closed and the boats would be stored in the galleries. This is the 'raison d'tre' of the caves,” he told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Whispers of a pyramid inspector</p> \n<p>Perhaps most astounding was the discovery in summer of around 800 pieces of papyri, dating to the reign of Cheopss 27th regnal reign. This is the oldest papyrus archive ever found in Egypt, according to the Egyptian Institute of Antiquities. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>These ancient documents were extraordinarily well preserved: some sheets were as much as a meter long.</p> \n<p>The excavators believe that the papyri are the archive of a team of sailors, and includes two categories of documents. One is accounts organized in tables, corresponding to daily or monthly deliveries of food from various areas including the Nile Delta: mostly bread and beer for the port workers.</p> \n<p>The other documents are logbooks recording everyday activities of a team led by an inspector named Merer, an official from Memphis.</p> \n<p>Merer, who oversaw a team about 40 men, was in charge of building the Great Pyramid in Giza. The documents describe transportation up the Nile River and the work at the limestone quarries, in the form of a time table.</p> \n<p>Every fourth day, blocks would be delivered to a pyramid construction site on the Giza plateau called the “Horizon of Cheops”, the papers explain.</p> \n<p>Did Herodotus libel Cheops?</p> \n<p>Merer's journal also mentions his passage through an important logistic and administrative center, ‘Ro-She Khufu' - which seems to have functioned as a stopping point near the Giza plateau.</p> \n<p>It is especially emphasized that Ro-She Khufu was under the authority of a high-ranking official, Ankhhaef – none other than the half-brother of Cheops himself. Ankhhaef was the pharaoh's vizier and by the end of his reign, had achieved the status of &quot;chief for all the works of the king&quot;.</p> \n<p>Other logs in the same archive provide information on other missions accomplished by the same team of sailors during the same year, including building a harbor on the Mediterranean Sea coast.</p> \n<p>Taller postulates that the harbor installations at Wadi el-Jarf served the Great Pyramid project by obtaining the vast amounts of copper necessary for tools (the pyramid was built millennia before the Iron Age), and some specific equipment used at Giza.</p> \n<p>Whatever the case, the Greek historian Herodotus describes Cheops as a harsh taskmaster, who forced all Egyptians to devote 20 years of their lives to dragging stone to the Great Pyramid he was building for his own aggrandizement. Cheops employed so many workers that it cost 1600 silver talents just to keep them supplied with black radish and onion, Herodotus reports (Histories 2.124).</p> \n<p>Today many Egyptologists suspect that the “black legends of Cheops” are exaggerated and that Herodotus inflated and the number of workers needed to build the pyramid.</p> \n<p>Recent calculations estimate that actually building the pyramid required 5,000 men, or, 15,000 if one includes people bringing the raw material to Giza, says Tallet, and adds, “They were not slaves, but specialists who were employed all the year long by the royal administration - and, from the records that we have on the papyrus, they were rather privileged.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Turkey recently decided to exclude teaching evolution in school science classes at all levels. Unveiling the new curriculum, the chair of the board of education Alpaslan Durmus said that such controversial topics are too complicated and controversial for Turkish children; they are better off learning them at university.</p> \n<p>Under the rule of the Islamist rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), there has been an attempt to build a nationalist society in which Islamic piety is central. Evolution is considered a dangerous challenge, one that cannot be reconciled with the belief in God.</p> \n<p>In 2006, a glossy &quot;Atlas of Creation&quot; found its way into many Turkish schools, claiming to disprove evolution by natural selection. It audaciously pointed to the fossil record to explain that creation is the handiwork of God. Evolution, the book further claimed, was responsible for un-Islamic and destructive doctrines such as Nazism and communism.</p> \n<p>A couple of years later, the website of famed evolutionary biologists, most notably Richard Dawkins, were blocked after Adnan Oktar, a fierce advocate of Islamic creationism, also known by his pen name Harun Yahya, the same gentleman who wrote the &quot;Atlas of Creation&quot;, claimed that Dawkins and others insulted him.</p> \n<p>In 2009, TUBITAK, the Turkish body that finances the sciences, censored a magazine article about the life and work of Charles Darwin. The magazine’s editor Cigdem Atakuman was removed from her position as punishment. Later in 2013, TUBITAK stopped selling books about evolution through its catalogue list made available for educators.</p> \n<p>Unable to totally suppress evolution, some tried to discredit it through good old-fashioned anti-Semitism. In 2012, a series of primary school books were released in a district of Istanbul which claimed that Charles Darwin was a Jew with a big nose and enjoyed the company of monkeys. Similarly, back in February 2016 Turkish columnist Seyfi Sahin claimed that Darwin had got it all mixed up. Citing the Koran, he argued that evolution was indeed true, but works in reverse because chimpanzees and gorillas are in fact mutated Jews who had been punished for their past perversions.</p> \n<p>Such anti-Semitic views are part and parcel of the Turkish Islamist worldview from which Erdogan and the AKP emerged. In this case used to bring home the message that evolution is un-Islamic. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last week’s announcement to cease teaching evolution is therefore no surprise. Ahead of April’s constitutional referendum to give President Erdogan more power, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus commented that “Scientifically, the theory of evolution is already an archaic and disproven theory. There is no such rule that this theory must be taught.” Indeed, there had already been reports detailing the new curriculum. More time to Turkish and Muslim scientists, less time to the country’s secular founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.</p> \n<p>It was not as if evolution was being taught well in Turkey in the first place. In contrast to the earlier 1983 school curriculum, the 2011 version about to be replaced taught evolution alongside creationism. Evolution was relegated to being an open question more akin to an unproved hypothesis. In some cases, even biology teachers demonstrated an unsound understanding of the scientific theory. Indeed, according to a 2011 Ipsos survey of 24 countries, only 19 per cent of Turks believe in evolution while 60 per cent hold creationist views, putting Turkey in the same bracket as Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.</p> \n<p>The Turkish education system, as well as many critics of evolution, fails to appreciate the difference between the meaning of the word theory as understood in everyday speech and its meaning among the scientific community. In everyday speech, a theory is synonymous to an idea or a supposition. However, for the scientific community, a theory, in this case Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, is an explanation of the highest of standings because it has undergone rigorous testing through observation and experimentation.</p> \n<p>Not all in Turkey are happy about the changes to the curriculum. Academics from Turkey’s leading universities earlier warned that Turkey would join the ranks of Saudi Arabia as the only other country that excludes teaching evolution.</p> \n<p>Turkey’s decision sheds light on Erdogan’s frequent vows to raise a devout and pious generation. Under the AKP there has been an expansion in the number of religious Imam Hatip schools in the public sector, but since 2012 their remit expanded to encompass not just high schools, but middle schools as well. This has made it increasingly difficult to find a school outside of the private sector that is not an Imam Hatip. And even if one is found, all public schools are obliged to offer classes on the Koran and the life of Mohammed as electives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But such policies come at a cost. Turkish schools have consistently performed poorly in international rankings of math, reading and science compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Turkey also faces an ever growing brain-drain as many educated Turks choose to leave the country, with an &quot;unprecedented&quot; surge by Turkish academics seeking placements abroad.</p> \n<p>The decision to ban teaching evolution is no doubt inspired by Erdogan and the AKP’s vision of Turkey in which Islam plays a central role and where a good Turk is a pious Turk. From their perspective, there is no greater challenge to this quest than evolution.</p> \n<p>Simon A.

Modi has no Jewish voters back at home to impress with a photo op with Bibi.</p> \n<p>Yet Modi is not only spending two days in in Israel, he isn’t troubling himself to pay a symbolic side trip on the Palestinian Authority in a nod to diplomatic balance.</p> \n<p>But then again, it might be fairer to say that the Indian leader isn’t visiting Israel either. He's visiting Startup Nation.</p> \n<p>Cold war with Pakistan</p> \n<p>Like China, India looks at the Jewish state as a valuable partner because of the technology and innovation it can provide. And that is part of a larger phenomenon of brainpower is emerging an important asset in world power politics, taking its place beside naked armed force, economics and the soft power of culture and values.</p> \n<p>By that standard, Israel is a force to be reckoned with. As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself put it earlier this year, “This is what makes us a significant player in the international arena, despite our size.”</p> \n<p>We’ve felt the power of technology and innovation in our relations with China for a long time. Chinese companies are major investors in Israeli high-tech, perhaps accounting for a third of the money now being put into startups. Israeli and Chinese universities have formed joint programs. Israeli technology is being employed across China to in areas like brain sciences, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, biomedicine, renewable energy, computer sciences, the aging of the population and smart cities.</p> \n<p>China has daunting problems to overcome in water usage, energy conservation, the environment and health to name a few. At the same time, it’s determined that its companies do more than assemble goods and copy products developed elsewhere, and become technology leaders in their own right.</p> \n<p>In India, the situation is a little different, but the core of its relationship with Israel is innovation as well.</p> \n<p>India’s first problem is national security and its cold war with Pakistan, and for years Israel and India have had close defense ties. But these are based on technology, not raw power, i.e., Israel doesn’t sell tanks and planes, but provides advice on counterterrorism and most importantly, it has been selling India high-tech weaponry.</p> \n<p>Now the relationship is focusing increasingly on the civilian side. The cabinet this week approved a series of measures and a 280 million shekel ($80 million) budget for joint research and development mainly in water and agricultural technology programs &nbsp;It also talked about increasing exports by 25% and luring more Indian tourists and even Bollywood producers to Israel, but that is small change compared to the tech relationship. Tech is the basis of our beautiful friendship.</p> \n<p>India is behind in China in terms of its global aspiration, but Modi is a free market, tech-friendly leader as much as he is a Hindu nationalist and he wants to see India become a world economic superpower. It’s one of the world’s largest economies, but that’s because it has a population of 1.3 billion, not because Indian products and services make a big splash in global markets.</p> \n<p>Even its vaunted high-tech sector is centered on outsourcing to foreign companies. Like China’s Xi Jinping, Modi recognizes that Israel can help change that.</p> \n<p>Brainpower drain</p> \n<p>For both countries, Israeli brains are important, but so is Israel’s willingness to share them.</p> \n<p>We have no pretense of being a great industrial power. Thus a lot of the best tech we develop, like self-driving cars, is available for whoever wants it.</p> \n<p>Vis-&agrave;-vis India, Israel has won a lot of defense business because it is open to joint ventures and co-production with Indian companies.</p> \n<p>America, another big source of innovation, is leery about China getting ahold of critical technology for business, including for security reasons, and also is cracking down on Indian tech contractors.</p> \n<p>But here we come back to the same old problem of how to make sure Israeli brainpower doesn’t go down the drain, because if it does, we not only lose the engine of the economy but a valuable political asset. “If we cannot innovate we will lose our advantage,” Netanyahu warned at the same time he was lauding tech diplomacy. “And in order to innovate we must have a free market.”</p> \n<p>Of course, a free market is critical to ensuring a continuous flow of new startups and new technology, but a lot of Israel’s biggest advances, certainly in defense, have come from the government-owned companies and the army itself.&nbsp; Free markets aren’t the be-all and end-all.</p> \n<p>What is really critical is ensuring that Israeli universities graduate enough engineers and technicians (which they aren’t), that Israel has enough schools that do their job of teaching fundamental skills (which it doesn't) and that Israel fosters a culture of free and independent thinking (which certainly many in the government disapprove of, at least when it comes to politics).</p> \n<p>Startup Nation is doing its part in enhancing Israeli power. It’s the government that is letting the country’s most valuable asset waste away.</p>",

How do you explain his [Trump's]&nbsp;win and who/what is to blame for it? At panels ranging from&nbsp;cyber security and fake news to the general divide in the country, the overall mood is one of a collective shiva, and not just from Democrats. Over 500 attendees packed an off-campus&nbsp;evening event at the St Regis last night to hear Bill Kristol and Ramesh Ponnuru bemoan the state and future of the Conservative movement in the Trump era. Typically known as 'DC's version of summer camp,' welcome to the 2017 Aspen Ideas Festival&nbsp;exile edition.&nbsp;  Bill Kristol on 2020: &quot;If the Republicans nominate Trump again in 2020 then it's hard for me to justify him as a one-off fluke for the GOP... It would mean it's a deeply problematic party.&quot; [Pic]  Earlier, Kristol wrote&nbsp;that he looks forward to engaging the Aspen audiences, &quot;Who will assume that because I'm anti-Trump I'm 'reasonable' on other issues. It will be fun to surprise them — and to have a chance to talk to some other presenters and guests about this unusual political moment.&quot; [AspenTimes]  HEARD LAST NIGHT --&nbsp;Jeffrey Goldberg explaining&nbsp;how Yoni Appelbaum became The Atlantic's politics editor: “Ta-Nehisi Coates, when he had a blog, used to have commenters at&nbsp;the bottom of the blog and he curated the comments so it wasn’t just dangerous, mentally ill people. And this commenter started showing up -- who went by the name ‘the cynic’ -- and his comments were unusually smart. Ta-Nehisi noticed and started talking back and forth with this person and eventually Ta-Nehisi would tell people around&nbsp;The Atlantic, ‘I don’t know, I think this guy has like a Ph.D. or something. This is crazy.’ Finally, Ta-Nehisi figured out who it was It was Yoni -- a 'sad' academic in the Boston area [teaching at Harvard], who clearly needed a venue to express all the things he was thinking beyond the narrow paradigm of academia. Yoni was in a tenure track universe, but he clearly had this journalism bug. One thing led to another and, thank goodness, Yoni made the decision to join the ranks of journalism.” [Video]  Spotted at the Start-Up Nation Central tent, highlighting Israeli innovation,&nbsp;on the Aspen&nbsp;Institute campus: CEO of the&nbsp;Aspen Institute&nbsp;Walter Isaacson schmoozing with Campbell Brown, Daniel Bonner, Debbie Hochberg, and&nbsp;Raphael Ouzan. [Pic]&nbsp;  Near the Facebook tent, David Brooks walking with a&nbsp;wiffle bat and balls [Pic]  Top Headline: &quot;Police looking into how car landed in pond at Aspen Meadows campus&quot; [AspenDailyNews]  Senator Chris Coons on how secular and religious communities have a common cause: “You can get to some of our most important priorities through two routes. You care about welcoming immigrants and refugees - you can get there because you care about other people as an intellectual, as a humanist, as a principled manner. Or you can get there relying on passages in Torah and Gospel about welcoming the stranger.” [YouTube]  Wendy Sherman, Richard Haass, Jane Harman and Samantha Power discussed foreign policy at a panel titled 'Has American Grand Strategy Gone Missing?' moderated by Rana Foroohar: “This panel may be four women and one man, but we are all card–carrying members of the swamp, and so are some of the people advising the current administration. I am ok with the swamp,&quot; explained Jane Harman... When Foroohar asked the audience to raise their hands if they feel the US presently has a coherent strategy, no hands were raised. Samantha Power, of all panelists,&nbsp;interjected: &quot;To be fair, three years ago, if you'd ask them the same thing... many wouldn't have raised their hands.&quot;&nbsp;  Power: &quot;The elite consensus [of the past sixty years]...is unlikely to be supported by most Americans.&quot;  Harman on making Congress work: “Obama did not invest in it, after trying it out for 10 minutes. He didn’t invest in it.”&nbsp;  Richard Haas on the NSC process: “You need a formal National Security process and it’s got to be the only one. You can’t afford more than one at a time [The George H.W. Bush administration] worked extraordinarily well for lots of reasons. What was so funny is that you had more experience per square inch, per pound in that administration, and it was probably the most organized NSC process we have ever had. All I will say, without getting into individuals, we probably have less experience on foreign policy in this administration than any post-WWII administration.”&nbsp;  SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY:&nbsp;‘It’s the End of Small Talk in Washington’ -- by Daniel Lippman and John F. Harris: &quot;Georgetown as LBJ thought of it, and as presidents up through Bill Clinton encountered it, is now a faint ghost, largely a historical phenomenon. But its lineal descendant is still very much around. It is that group of scene-makers and self-promoters, along with some well-intentioned people who genuinely admire public service, that journalist Mark Leibovich skewered in his 2013 book This Town.&nbsp;If these were normal times, the kind of people LBJ excoriated and Leibovich lampooned would be engaged right now in a familiar ritual. It would involve lunches and dinners with the new White House team, off-the-record chats about the workings of government mixed with let’s-be-friends chatter about real estate and schools and fitness routines. But these aren’t normal times. Team Trump is showing few signs so far of hungering for the sort of social intercourse with permanent Washington that usually accompanies a new administration.&quot;  &quot;Ivanka and Jared, who have three young children and observe Shabbat on Friday evenings, don’t get out much, either.&nbsp;The Trump-Kushners live a three-minute walk from Barack and Michelle Obama...&nbsp;But the contrast with the Obamas has been instructive.&nbsp;People who live near the Trump-Kushners initially didn’t receive such outreach or handwritten cards, and the oversight was noted. After published reports about how Ivanka’s neighbors were angry at the disruptions to their street—one irate Kalorama resident called it “a three-ring circus from the day that they moved in”—the first daughter showed up at several of their doors with a peace offering: two blue cupcakes baked by daughter Arabella, and an apology for the chaos her move to Tracy Place has caused.&quot; [PoliticoMag]  &quot;Kushner adds powerhouse lawyer Abbe Lowell to legal team&quot; by Josh Dawsey:&nbsp;&quot;Jared Kushner has hired Abbe Lowell, one of the country's leading criminal defense lawyers, to represent him in the special counsel's probe of potential Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and his financial dealings...&nbsp;But Kushner has also decided to keep Jamie Gorelick, his current lawyer and a WilmerHale partner, on his legal team...&nbsp;Lowell, a Democrat, has represented prominent politicians such as John Edwards and lobbyist Jack Abramoff.&quot; [Politico]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer asked about reported tension between the U.S. peace negotiations team and the Palestinians at the&nbsp;daily press briefing: “Well, first, I think the meetings were extremely productive. They're going to make incremental movements forward, but it's going to be a process. It's not going to get solved in a night. And I think they made some good progress overall, and also continuing to build trust between all the parties. It's no secret, I know, that when President Abbas was here, we discussed the payments as an issue then, and so it should be no surprise it came up. But I would argue that the relationship continues to be very strong and move forward in a positive way.”  Israeli Minister Bennett: Trump pressure on settlements disappoints:&nbsp;&quot;Naftali Bennett, leader of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, says the settler movement expected a building boom after Trump's election...&nbsp;&quot;Unfortunately from our perspective, he's sort of going down the same unsuccessful path that his predecessors did,&quot; Bennett said in an interview Monday. &quot;So yes, there is disappointment out there.&quot;&quot; [AP]  PEW SURVEY -- Israel one of two countries with higher Trump favorability than Obama -- by Aaron Magid: Israeli confidence in Trump is currently at 56% compared to 49% at the end of Obama’s term. At the same time, the Israeli favorability view of the United States has remained consistent at 81% from 2015-2017. Israel is the country that most strongly believes that its ties with Washington will improve during the Trump administration (65%), with only 8% thinking that relations will decline.&nbsp;Regarding Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the Mexican border, Israel was the country with the second highest number of backers for this proposal worldwide.  The most dramatic break with Trump was over the withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. 69% of Israelis opposed the administration’s decision with a mere 19% backing the initiative. Jerusalem is one of the signers of the international environment agreement.&nbsp;[JewishInsider]  JI INTERVIEW -- Rep Brad Schneider (D-IL) discussed U.S. foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, his legislative priorities and his upcoming reelection bid in 2018 in an interview with JI's Aaron Magid.&nbsp;“I was the first Democrat to win in 2012. I lost in 2014&nbsp;and I’m back now,&quot; he said. “It’s good to be back and pick up where I left off to have the opportunity to step into a leadership role. I am not focused on the next election.&nbsp;If I make sure that I stay in touch with the people I represent, I’m going to have an opportunity to make a difference in the 10th district.” Schneider will likely&nbsp;face&nbsp;Jeremy Wynes, a former AIPAC, RJC staffer, in the 2018 midterm elections.  In recent weeks, Schneider has introduced several pro-Israel bills including legislation that would boost funding for the Department of Defense to carry out research with Israel focused on tunnel detection technologies. Additionally, Schneider took the lead on a bipartisan bill that would strengthen Israel’s Qualitative Military Edge (QME), which is especially timely given the administration’s $110 billion arms sales deal&nbsp;with Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;  Schneider On Taylor Force Act:&nbsp;“US policy is clear that the Palestinians have to stop providing payments to families of terrorists.&nbsp;It’s important that the US continues to have its leverage and exert its influence in the region with the Palestinians. I am adamantly against these payments by the Palestinians. I am working with my colleagues here to find a way to put pressure on the Palestinians to stop it but I also understand that we need to make sure that we preserve the ability to have leverage and the Israelis to continue security cooperation with the PA.” Read the full interview here [JewishInsider]  ON THE HILL --&nbsp;Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker (R-TN)&nbsp;announced yesterday that he would block President Donald Trump's weapons sales to Gulf states until the Qatar dispute is resolved. &quot;Recent disputes among the GCC countries only serve to hurt efforts to fight ISIS and counter Iran,&quot; Corker said. Jewish groups have expressed concern over the $110 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. AIPAC has questioned how this agreement would impact Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) and J Street condemned the move because of Saudi Arabia's bombing of civilians in the ongoing Yemen crisis. However, Corker's obstruction cited a different reason to &quot;resolve the current dispute (with Qatar) and reunify the GCC.&quot;&nbsp;  IRAN DEAL: &quot;Trump administration welcomes financial watchdog’s Iran sanctions reprieve&quot; by Laura Rozen:&nbsp;&quot;The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) voted last week to continue suspending countermeasures on Iran indefinitely, while keeping the country on the banking advisory body’s black list.&nbsp;State and Treasury officials told Al-Monitor they welcomed the decision to warn about the risks of doing business with Iran... Iran, for its part, said it was encouraged that the United States joined the global agency’s decision to suspend countermeasures on Iran. Former US lawmakers affiliated with the hawkish United Against Nuclear Iran&nbsp;lobbied against the sanctions reprieve, to no avail.&quot; [Al-Monitor]&nbsp;  SPOTLIGHT:&nbsp;“Evidence Ties Israeli Firm To Turkish Businessman At Heart Of Flynn Scandal, Despite Denials” by Borzou Daragahi: “Orit Teicher, of the Israeli public relations and crisis-management firm Shalom Tel Aviv, told BuzzFeed News in a short email: “Ratio did not employ the services of Mr. Ekim Alptekin nor Inovo BV.” She declined to elaborate on the photographs or documents that suggest otherwise. Photos of [Kamil Ekim] Alptekin seen by BuzzFeed News show he attended an energy conference in Israel in November 2016 as a guest of Ratio. In one photo, Alptekin can be seen wearing a conference name tag showing his name and, in Hebrew, “Ratio Oil Exploration (1992) Partnership,” as his affiliation. Emails seen by BuzzFeed News also show that Ratio advisers and officials, including [Yossi] Shazar, helped organize Alptekin’s two-day trip to Israel.” [BuzzFeed]</p> \n<p>** Good Tuesday Morning!

And now there’s a video” by Ruth Eglash: “The nearly three-minute animated clip says the island would provide Palestinians with “humanitarian, economic and transportation gateway to the world without endangering Israel’s security.” The island, according to [minister for intelligence Israel] Katz, would be financed, built and owned by the international community. It would sit roughly three miles of the coast of Gaza and be connected to the enclave by a bridge A spokesman for Katz, who is known as the bulldozer of Israeli politics for not stopping until he gets what he wants, said he refuses to give up on the idea.” [WashPost]  KAFE KNESSET --&nbsp;The religious wars continue -- by Tal Shalev and JPost's Lahav Harkov:&nbsp;Two days after the controversial government decisions to suspend the Kotel agreement and promote a new conversion bill, the issue is still high on the agenda. PM Netanyahu made multiple attempt yesterday to douse the flames, meeting with Jewish Federation leaders and conducting a phone call with the Jewish Agency chairman, Natan Sharansky. But according to well-informed sources, none of these encounters went very well. “Netanyahu tried to convince Sharansky and the Federation leaders that he did not succumb to the Haredi pressure and that the suspension of the Kotel agreement is actually progress – because it will enable practical steps to develop the area easier, but they clarified that this is a crisis that is not going to go away so fast.”  Meanwhile, early this morning, Jewish Home’s Naftali Bennett woke up and realized there are some political points to be made in this debacle. Bennett immediately embarked on a vocal campaign, warning of a serious crisis with US Jewry, who, according to Bennett “received a slap in the face from the Israeli government and feel unwanted. Of course it is not true. The Jews of the United States are welcome and beloved, they are our brothers. But mistakes were made in timing and in the form of things,” he said in a Tweet storm. Bennett followed these statements with a press briefing and an on-camera statement. Bennett and his fellow party member, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, then invited Jewish Agency trustees, Federation leaders and Reform and Conservative representatives for a special meeting to discuss ideas to move beyond the crisis. Today, Bennett is trying to play the “responsible adult,” but on Sunday he did nothing to stop the decisions made by the government, even though the new conversion bill hurts parts of his own religious-Zionist constituency. Read today's entire Kafe Knesset here [JewishInsider]  WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked yesterday by Time's Zeke Miller:&nbsp;&quot;Prime Minister Netanyahu reversed on a deal to create&nbsp;a gender-neutral space on the Western Wall.&nbsp;And a number of American Jewish leaders are blasting the Israeli Prime Minister.&nbsp;Has there been any contact on this sensitive issue?&nbsp;And does that the White House take any position on that?&quot;  Spicer:&nbsp;&quot;I don’t have anything for you on that right now.&nbsp;I would probably refer you to the State Department.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Abe Foxman tells us...&nbsp;&quot;Netanyahu cannot have it both ways. He can’t promise American Jews time and time again to support their requests and demands for religious respect and pluralism and overnight, because of political pressure, throw them to the winds. It has worked at times before. I don't think it will work this time. Diaspora Jewry needs to hold strong and united and say: Not again! Israel will lose future generations of American Jews, not on settlements or the ‘occupation’ but on religious respect and pluralism. But, at the same time, we also need&nbsp;be careful not to play the political card in reverse. I am not sure that at this time it is productive to embrace the Israeli opposition as a political party. American Jews should stand up on principle and not the politics.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;Mariah Carey Stirs Controversy in Israel&quot; by David Caspi: &quot;Arriving Monday afternoon in Tel Aviv to promote a new partnership with local skincare line Premier Dead Sea Cosmetics, Mariah Carey presided over a press conference followed by select TV interviews where the topic soon turned to the pop star’s ex-fianc&eacute;, Australian billionaire James Packer and a&nbsp;corruption investigation involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&nbsp;“I don’t know where the motherf—er is,” Carey laughingly said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 News when asked about Packer’s whereabouts. “How am I supposed to know? I don’t know, for real. I really have no idea about the political stuff that goes on, I don’t pay attention to it.” [HollywoodReporter]  TALK OF THE TOWN: “Foes in high places: How de Blasio lost mayoral control” by&nbsp;Jimmy Vielkind and Gloria Pazmino:&nbsp;“At least part of the reason is that key officials... either dislike or are indifferent to Mayor Bill de Blasio And [Senator Simcha] Felder does not get along with de Blasio.

        "text":["<p>At least some of the soldiers who provide statements to groups such as Breaking the Silence and B’Tselem think they are helping improve the ethical behavior of the Israel Defense Forces in the territories. But it turns out these organizations are aiming for much bigger things.</p> \n<p>In their view, the way to end the occupation must be through changing international public opinion in order to apply outside pressure on Israel. This makes it clear why they sometimes exaggerate in their descriptions of our sins, because their goal is not cautious documentation, but propaganda.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;  B'Tselem doesn't take orders from Netanyahu. Nor does the world | B'Tselem head&nbsp; &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>If there was a realistic option to bring about the end of the occupation in the foreseeable future, then this would have the potential of rescuing Israel from one of its most serious dangers, a binational state. But for now, no such option exists. It is only possible to lay the foundation for it and pressure on Israel based on a one-sided picture of the conflict certainly will not promote it.</p> \n<p>First, because the mistaken conception in which the Jews are brutes and the Palestinians the innocent victims causes Israelis to move to the right. Second, because the Palestinians have torpedoed agreements time after time, and now, too, are continuing to stubbornly demand the right of return, pressure on Israel will not solve the main problem, nor will it change the Palestinian position. In fact, the opposite is true. It will push them to entrench themselves in their positions and wait. Why should they give in on something as long as pressure is being put on the other side?</p> \n<p>So it is not surprising that the chief beneficiaries for now from the activities of B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence are not the organizations supporting peace and compromise, but actually those that want to inflame the conflict. For example, many of the members of the BDS movement, who are trying to eliminate Israel, feel the materials from B’Tselem and Breaking the Silence advance their goals. How much of this contribution is intentional is open to interpretation, because it is hard to draw a line separating the racist demonization of Israel by declared anti-Semites and the tendency to exaggerate in describing our sins by those who aspire to “only” create international pressure against the occupation. In practice, they are the same thing.</p> \n<p>All this, too, diverts attention from the attitude of the Palestinians toward human rights. That is a shame, because it seems that here lies the great irony behind this entire use of human rights to create pressure on Israel: Experience teaches that human rights are violated more, not less, in places where the Israeli occupation has been removed. The savagery of Hamas demonstrated this clearly, but neither are the Palestinian Authority’s preventive security forces particularly committed to human rights. In this sense, focusing on Israel seems to be shutting your eyes, not opening them. It turns out that B’Tselem is very careful about the eye it insists on closing, no less than the eye is wants to open. (Take for example the case of Bassem Eid, who says he wanted to report on human rights violations by the PA from within B’Tselem, and was forced to leave the organization.)</p> \n<p>If these organizations are pushing off the end of the occupation, and would not improve human rights even if they brought about its end, then what use can there be for their reports – except for the demonization of Israel? They do have an important use: Improving the ethical norms of IDF soldiers. And if they had wanted to advance this goal, then they would have been better off focusing their efforts inside Israel and providing information that the authorities can check on and then act accordingly. Adding oil to the fire of hatred outside of Israel will not help.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the ancient city of Emesus in Syria, known today as Homs and located in the middle of the bloody Syrian civil war, stood a large conical black meteorite in the 3rd century that was the symbol of the god Elagabalus, the Syrian god of the mountains. In 218 C.E., a new Roman emperor, who came from Emesus, took the throne and he took the royal name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus.&nbsp;In his youth, he served as a priest of Elagabalus and only after his assassination in 222 was he named after the Syrian god.</p> \n<p>Elagabalus is remembered as one of the most corrupt emperors in Roman history and did not shy from bloodshed. But he is also known for granting rights to women. Some sources say he was a man who wanted to be a woman and searched for a physician who could operate on him and equip him with female genitalia. The coins minted during his years on the throne clearly reflect his desire to shake up the accepted world order. On one side of the coins is the youthful face of the emperor and on the flip side are horses harnessed to a chariot carrying the holy meteorite with the Roman eagle above it. The coin was intended to make it clear that the Syrian god was on his way to join the pantheon of Roman gods.</p> \n<p>This coin can now be viewed in a new exhibit at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, starting on Thursday. ”Faces of Power: Coins from the Victor Adda Collection” displays 75 gold coins of Roman emperors and their wives never shown to the public before. The collection of gold coins was donated to the Israel Museum by Johanna Adda Cohen, an 89-year-old resident of Rome. Her father, Victor Adda, was a Jewish businessman originally from Egypt and he collected the coins in the first half of the 20th century. When the family moved to Italy from Egypt, they smuggled the coins out in the pockets of relatives and friends.</p> \n<p>The exhibition displays 75 coins, a small fraction of the original collection. The collection was divided up between Victor Adda’s four daughters, but because it was originally so enormous, each daughter received what was really an almost full collection in its own right representing all the periods of the Roman Empire. The curators of the temporary exhibition in the archeology wing of the museum are Haim Gitler and Yaniv Schauer.</p> \n<p>The coins, all cast from pure gold, represent a period of about 350 years. The oldest coin is of Julius Caesar, who was the first living person to put his portrait on a Roman coin. His decision to use his portrait on coins was a major symbol of the change to one-man rule, and one of the causes of his assassination. On the reverse of a later coin (which is not part of the exhibit), minted by one of the most famous murderers in history, Brutus, can be seen the dagger, a symbol of the assassination.</p> \n<p>The first Roman ruler to use the title Caesar was Augustus, Julius Caesar’s adopted son, whose thin visage is on a coin from 27 C.E. Another coin alongside it shows the filled-out face of Marc Anthony, the general and lover of Cleopatra who was defeated by Augustus in the fight for control of the empire.</p> \n<p>Coins of losers who managed to rule for only a short time are of course quite rare, so they are also more expensive. For example, the collection has a coin from the reign of Emperor Didius Julianus, whose rule lasted barely three months before he was assassinated in 193. The coin features a portrait of his daughter with an inscription that means “happy times.”</p> \n<p>The portraits are most likely accurate reflections of the way the emperors really looked, without any major attempt to beautify, or “Photoshop” reality. Vespasian, the emperor remembered in Israel mostly for his siege of Jerusalem, is shown as rather ugly and fat with an angry face.</p> \n<p>The imperial gold coins were not originally intended for collectors or decoration, but were part of the foundation of the economy of the Roman Empire. “People held on to [the coins] because they knew they would keep their value,” says Gitler. Each gold coin was worth 25 silver coins, and every silver coin was worth 25 bronze coins. Mostly they were made from pure 24-karat gold. The entire exhibition has 518 grams of gold, worth about $22,000 just for the metal content. But the coin collection is worth an estimated $7.5 million.</p> \n<p>If we try to compare the value of the coins in ancient times to their value today, we find that the annual wage for a Roman legionnaire was nine gold coins. One such coin could have bought three amphoras (large jugs) of olive oil, 12 pairs of shoes or a donkey. Today, the most valuable coin in the collection could buy a three-room apartment on Rothschild Boulevard in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Gitler says the emperor’s portrait was meant to deliver a message. “At first they are portrayed as eternally youthful, after that they are shown as senatorial figures, older with a fuller face. They thought it gave them more credibility. In the next stage the philosophical emperors appear, who are characterized by a beard and later the emperors show themselves as soldiers.”</p> \n<p>No less important are the reverse sides of the coins. These usually show portraits of gods as well as slogans to increase morale, along with propaganda messages: “Peace and security,” “Eternal unity,” “Freedom restored,” etc. “These same slogans can be found in speeches by today’s politicians or on bumper stickers. Coins were the means to pass on the emperor’s messages,” notes Gitler.</p>",

While his economic reforms aim to modernize the economy and open Saudi society to innovation and entrepreneurship, at the same time he remains loyal to the country’s powerful Islamic clerics.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia's highest religious body, the Council of Senior Scholars, immediately applauded his appointment as crown prince, the Saudi Press Agency stated on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Qatar crisis role</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, Saudi Arabia led the charge against its Gulf neighbor Qatar, implementing a severe boycott of the energy-rich nation, which it accused of supporting terrorism.</p> \n<p>Bin Salman was reportedly instrumental in orchestrating the diplomatic rift with the Gulf state, which was joined by Saudi allies Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, among others.</p> \n<p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the 56-year-old crown prince of Abu Dhabi, joined bin Salman in leading the charge against Qatar. As a result, the duo cemented themselves as the new, young generation of leaders in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>“They stand in contrast to previous Gulf Arab leaders who over decades weathered crises mostly by time-consuming conciliation,” reported Reuters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Their rival is also young: Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, took over from his father at 33 in 2013.</p> \n<p>Yemen humanitarian crisis</p> \n<p>The United Nations announced in March, on the second anniversary of the Yemen conflict, 4,773 confirmed civilian deaths and 8,272 injured in &nbsp;the ongoing conflict that pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the Saudi-led Arab coalition in support of the ousted Yemen government.</p> \n<p>The UN added that, on average,&nbsp;100 civilians are killed each month as the war continues.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The war has taken a heavy toll on the country's food supply and health facilities. Saudi-led airstrikes have bombed many hospitals and clinics, while others have had to close their doors because of the fighting.</p> \n<p>Less than a third of Yemen's 24 million people have access to health facilities, according to UNICEF, which says at least 1,000 Yemeni children die every week from preventable diseases, while some 2.2 million children suffer from malnutrition across Yemen.</p> \n<p>Saudi-led airstrike have been responsible for mass killings of civilians on multiple occasions, including the repeated bombing of a crowded funeral hall in Sana in 2016, which killed 140.</p> \n<p>Additionally, under bin Salman’s leadership as defense minister, Saudi Arabia has admitted to dropping British-made cluster bombs in Yemen.</p> \n<p>The United Kingdom stopped manufacturing cluster bombs in 1989 and signed up to a convention in 2008 not to use them anymore for humanitarian reasons.</p> \n<p>Bin Salman met with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House a month before Trump’s first official overseas visit, which was to Saudi Arabia in May.</p> \n<p>During that visit, Trump announced one of the largest weapons sales in history, totaling $110-billion worth of tanks, artillery, radar systems, armored personnel carriers, Blackhawk helicopters and Patriot missiles. Much of that military hardware will likely be used in the Saudi fighting in Yemen.</p> \n<p>On June 15, the UN Security Council unanimously called for a cease-fire in the conflict between the Saudi-UAE coalition and the Houthi-Saleh forces in Yemen. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>UNHRC –&nbsp;Seat on Women’s Commission</p> \n<p>Human rights advocacy groups have repeatedly called for Saudi Arabia to be booted from the UN Human Rights Council since its three-year term on the council began in 2016.</p> \n<p>The Saudis have &quot;an appalling record of violations in Yemen while a Human Rights Council member,&quot; insisted Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, in a June 2016 joint statement.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia also raised the ire of human rights groups after it was elected to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.</p> \n<p>It was uncovered in 2015 that Saudi Arabia only managed to get on the UNHRC after a secret a deal with the United Kingdom. The U.K. undertook a clandestine vote-trading deal with Saudi Arabia to guarantee both nations would have a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, the Guardian reported.</p> \n<p>Granted, bin Salman had no reported direct personal association with the secret deal to get on the UNHRC. But his ongoing campaign in Yemen has been spared much condemnation by Saudi Arabia having a louder voice on the council.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia and the Islamic State group</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia has been accused repeatedly of supporting Islamic extremism, even the Islamic State group. After ISIS carried out attacks on the Iranian parliament in Tehran two weeks ago, Iran immediately pointed the finger at Saudi Arabia –&nbsp;which is nothing new, since Iran and Saudi Arabia have long exchanged accusations of supporting terror. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, during the 2016 presidential election, leaked emails from Hillary Clinton exposed to what extent the U.S. government was concerned over Saudi Arabia’s ties to ISIS. In a 2014 email, then-Secretary of State Clinton wrote, “We need to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups in the region.”</p> \n<p>Clinton’s sentiments have some bipartisan support: U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who was leading a congressional fight against Trump’s arms sale to Saudi Arabia, also accused the Saudis of funding terrorism. “If you support Israel, you can't support more arms sales to Saudi Arabia,” Paul concluded.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another newly released email, from January 2016, includes an excerpt from a private October 2013 speech in which Clinton acknowledged that “the Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on earth over the course of the last 30 years.”</p> \n<p>Both as defense minister and in pushing his economic reforms, bin Salman&nbsp;is in a difficult position, since his rule relies on the powerful clergy of the kingdom’s semi-official Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam.</p> \n<p>A June 2013 report from the European Parliament claimed Wahhabism is the main source of global terrorism. It also found that Saudi Arabia had spent more than $10 million&nbsp;promoting the creed through charities around the Muslim world.</p> \n<p>As a result, according to The New York Times, &quot;American government reports say financial support for terrorism from Saudis 'remains a&nbsp;threat&nbsp;to the kingdom and the international community.'”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Buying a yacht while imposing austerity</p> \n<p>On a different front, bin Salman was widely criticized for purchasing a $550-million &quot;superyacht&quot; while pushing through drastic austerity measures in Saudi Arabia. Bin Salman bought the 440-foot yacht from Russian billionaire Yuri Shefler while holidaying in the south of France in October 2016.</p> \n<p>During that same period, bin Salman had frozen government contracts and dropped Saudi Arabia's capital spending by 71 per cent.</p>",

        "text":["<p>MEXICO CITY — A team of international investigators brought to&nbsp;Mexico&nbsp;to unravel one of the nation’s gravest human rights atrocities was targeted with sophisticated surveillance technology sold to the Mexican government to spy on criminals and terrorists.</p> \n<p>The spying took place during what the investigators call a broad&nbsp;campaign of harassment&nbsp;and&nbsp;interference&nbsp;that prevented them from solving the haunting case of 43 students who disappeared after clashing with the police nearly three years ago.</p> \n<p>Appointed by an international commission that polices human rights in the Americas, the investigators say they were quickly met with stonewalling by the Mexican government, a refusal to turn over documents or grant vital interviews, and even a retaliatory criminal investigation.</p> \n<p>Now, forensic evidence shows that the international investigators were being targeted by advanced surveillance technology as well.</p> \n<p>The main contact person for the group of investigators received text messages laced with&nbsp;spyware known as Pegasus, a cyberweapon that the government of Mexico spent tens of millions of dollars to acquire, according to an independent analysis. The coordinator’s phone was used by nearly all members of the group, often serving as a nexus of communication among the investigators, their sources, the international commission that appointed them and the Mexican government.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, the investigators say they received identical text messages on their own phones, too, luring them to click on links that secretly unlock a target’s smartphone and turn it into a powerful surveillance device. Calls, emails, text messages, calendars and contacts can all be monitored that way. Encrypted messages become worthless. Even the microphone and camera on a smartphone can be used against its owner.</p> \n<p>The effort to spy on international officials adds to a&nbsp;sweeping&nbsp;espionage offensive&nbsp;in Mexico, where some of the country’s most prominent journalists, human rights lawyers and anticorruption activists have been the targets of the same surveillance technology. But the new evidence shows that the spying campaign went beyond the nation’s domestic critics.</p> \n<p>It also swept up international officials who had been granted a status akin to diplomatic immunity as well as unprecedented access to investigate a case that has come to define the nation’s broken rule of law — and the legacy of its president, Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto.</p> \n<p>Surveillance under Mexican law can be conducted only with the authorization of a federal judge, and only if the government can show cause to do so. But the kind of diplomatic immunity the investigators received meant that it was extremely unlikely that a federal judge would have been allowed to sign off on such a warrant, the investigators said.</p> \n<p>“You are not just hacking anyone’s phone, you are hacking the phone of someone who has been granted immunity,” said Francisco Cox, one of the investigators and a prominent Chilean lawyer. “They couldn’t even search my bags in the airport.”</p> \n<p>“If this can happen to an independent body that has immunity and that is invited by the government, it is a bit scary to think of what could happen to a common citizen in Mexico,” he said.</p> \n<p>Since 2011, Mexico has purchased at least $80 million worth of the spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, and only on the condition that it be used against terrorists and criminals. But&nbsp;an investigation&nbsp;by The New York Times and forensic cyberanalysts in recent weeks determined that the software had been used against some of the country’s most influential academics, lawyers, journalists and their family members, including a teenage boy.</p> \n<p>The government has denied responsibility for the espionage, adding that there is no ironclad proof because the spyware does not leave behind the hacker’s individual fingerprints. It has promised a thorough investigation, vowing to call on specialists from the United Nations and the F.B.I. for help. One of the surveillance targets, the forensic analysis showed, was a United States lawyer representing victims of sexual assault by the Mexican police.</p> \n<p>But the United States ambassador to Mexico, Roberta S. Jacobson, said the United States was not involved in the investigation. Opposition lawmakers and international officials are now calling for an independent inquiry into the spying scandal, declaring Mexico unfit to investigate itself.</p> \n<p>“This case just on its face — and presuming the veracity of the allegations — is serious enough to warrant the creation of an international commission,” said James L. Cavallaro, a commissioner on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which appointed the group of experts. “The commission shares the concerns of others: How can the government be trusted to investigate its own alleged violation of citizen rights given its track record in this matter?”</p> \n<p>Another commissioner, Esmeralda Arosemena de Troiti&ntilde;o, backed the idea of an independent inquiry. “This investigation should find both the material and intellectual authors of the alleged spying,” she said.</p> \n<p>Top officials from the nation’s main opposition party have come forward to say that they, too, have been targeted, raising the pressure on the government. The head of the National Action Party, Ricardo Anaya, says his party is pushing for a congressional committee to conduct its own inquiry and will also formally demand an international investigation into the spying.</p> \n<p>“The grand tragedy of Mexico is impunity. Horrible things occur, and nothing happens,” he said. “This time, we will not let that happen.”</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;disappearance of the students&nbsp;in September 2014 ignited an enormous outcry in Mexico. Hundreds of thousands poured into the streets to protest a case that, to many, represented all that afflicts Mexico, a nation where about 30,000 people have disappeared and more than 100,000 have been killed in the decade-long churn of the drug war.</p> \n<p>The anger also focused on Mr. Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, whose determination to change the narrative of his country from one of desperate violence to economic promise was suddenly, and permanently, upended. The outrage has been matched only by the disbelief that, almost three years later, nearly all of the 43 students are still missing. The remains of one have been discovered. Fragments of another may also have been identified. The rest of the students, whether dead or alive, have not been found.</p> \n<p>Many Mexicans believed that their best chance of finding out what really happened to the students lay with the international investigators, who were appointed by the&nbsp;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a regional body based in Washington that monitors countries and can refer cases to court. But the investigators said the government essentially obstructed their inquiry and then cast them out by refusing to extend their mandate — evidence, they said, that the government simply did not want the case solved.</p> \n<p>Still, it is hard to prove who ordered the spying. Even the manufacturer of the spyware, an Israeli cyberarms manufacturer called the NSO Group, says it cannot determine who, precisely, is behind specific hacking attempts using its technology.</p> \n<p>But the company says that it sells its surveillance tools only to governments, and that stringent safeguards prevent them from being used by anyone outside of the government agencies that purchase the technology.</p> \n<p>Moreover, once a person’s phone is targeted, researchers can verify that the spyware has been deployed by examining the text message to determine whether it points to a server running NSO’s technology. They have confirmed at least 19 cases in Mexico involving human rights lawyers, anticorruption activists, journalists and, now, international officials.</p> \n<p>“Citizen Lab and our partners are finding people targeted with NSO spyware almost wherever we look in Mexico,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at&nbsp;Citizen Lab&nbsp;at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, which has worked with the digital rights group R3D in Mexico to identify the spyware on the phones of targeted activists and officials.</p> \n<p>“I have never seen anything that matches the scale and scope of this case,” he said of the surveillance campaign in Mexico.</p> \n<p>Hacking attempts disguised as text messages appeared on the cellphone of the executive secretary for the investigators, the point person for all contacts with the group, on March 1 and 4, 2016, the forensic analysis found. Around the same time, lawyers for Centro Prodh, a human rights group looking into the mass disappearance of the students, were also being targeted by the software.</p> \n<p>“The Mexican government implored the commission to create this expert group, and then when their investigation did not ratify the official version, things changed,” said Mr. Cavallaro, who was the president of the Inter-American Commission at the time of the hacking attempts. “If it’s true that the government spied or tried to spy on our experts, that would be an outrage of historic proportions.”</p> \n<p>The investigators sent a private letter to the Inter-American Commission late last month, detailing their suspicions after The Times published&nbsp;an article&nbsp;about the hacking campaign. They said some of their phones had also been subject to suspicious messages.</p> \n<p>One message, sent to one of the investigators in March, was from someone posing as a close friend whose father had died. A link was attached with the details of the funeral. When the link was opened, the website of a well-known funeral home in Mexico popped up. A similar message, with the same link, was also sent last year to an academic trying&nbsp;to impose a sugar tax&nbsp;in Mexico. In that case, the message was confirmed as Pegasus.</p> \n<p>During the hacking attempts on the investigators, the group was in the throes of a crisis. The investigators had just complained publicly of being harassed, and they were less than two months from publishing their final report, which rejected the government’s version of what happened to the students.</p> \n<p>The mystery began on Sept. 26, 2014, when about 100 students from a teachers’ college in the town of Ayotzinapa struck out to commandeer some buses. As they had in years past, the students planned to take the buses to Mexico City to attend a commemorative march and then return them, a tradition both the bus companies and the authorities typically tolerated.</p> \n<p>But that night soon turned into an ominous chapter in Mexico’s modern history. The police fired mercilessly on the students and the buses transporting them, leaving six dead and scores wounded. The police emptied two buses of students, detained them and whisked them away in patrol cars.</p> \n<p>The government maintains that local police officers, along with the drug gang they worked for, kidnapped the students, killed them and incinerated their bodies in a nearby dump.</p> \n<p>The government version, however, never offered a clear motive for the attack on the students, and Mexicans pushed for an international inquiry. Eventually, the government agreed, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights appointed a five-member team of prominent prosecutors and rights activists from across the Spanish-speaking world.</p> \n<p>When the investigators arrived in Mexico, after months of local protests over the disappearances, it was an exceptional moment: a reclusive government opening itself up to external scrutiny.</p> \n<p>But within a few months, the relationship between the government and the investigators began to sour. In its first report, the investigators contradicted a central tenet of the government’s version, saying it could find no evidence of a fire big enough to burn 43 bodies, nor any remnants or bone fragments that matched those of the missing.</p> \n<p>The acrimony came quickly. Pro-government newspapers began attacking the group, and the Mexican government opened a criminal investigation against the executive secretary of the Inter-American Commission, based on unsubstantiated claims about the misuse of funds.</p> \n<p>“We always worked in good faith, and we went with open eyes and an open mind, only going where the facts led us,” said Mr. Cox, one of the investigators. “Our purpose was to contribute to the rule of law in Mexico.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The saga of a cult of ultra-Orthodox fundamentalist Jews whose controversial practices have led them to wander the world – from Israel to the U.S., Canada, Guatemala and finally to Mexico – could be heading into a dramatic final chapter.</p> \n<p>Mexican media outlets are reporting that the charismatic leader of the Lev Tahor sect, Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans, drowned in a river.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Who is Lev Tahor, the 'Jewish Taliban'? &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>A Foreign Ministry spokesman told Haaretz that an official from the Israeli consulate in Mexico is headed to the country’s southern region to confirm the death and identify Helbrans’ body. According to Mexican media reports, Helbrans, 55, was overtaken by river currents in the southeastern state of Chiapas while taking part in a ritual immersion.</p> \n<p>The fact that members of the group, ruled a “dangerous cult” by an Israeli court, were living in Mexico was little-known. Oded Twik, an activist for the families of Lev Tahor members, said that Helbrans had quietly led his followers out of Guatemala several months ago, crossing the border into the Chiapas, where they were seeking asylum status, without alerting the media. The Mexican government, he said, had allowed Helbrans and his followers to temporarily remain in the country for 180 days, and the group had already begun a campaign to convince the Mexicans to let them stay longer.</p> \n<p>When the news of Helbrans’ drowning first broke on Saturday, Twik thought perhaps they weren’t true and it was some kind of a ruse. “I suspected that he staged it” in order to evade authorities who were chasing him, he said. But over the course day on Sunday, he checked with his contacts in the region and the reports appeared increasingly credible.</p> \n<p>Twik was told that Helbrans was not yet been buried and that his body was in refrigeration, awaiting official identification, but his family members would not permit an autopsy. The activist, who extracted his own family members from Lev Tahor in Guatemala two years ago, said he was concerned about ensuing actions by the group’s leadership following Helbrans’ death. He also worried that distressed members could harm themselves: “These are people in a cult who have lost their spiritual leader. The reaction could be extreme.”</p> \n<p>There is little that isn’t extreme about Lev Tahor, comprised of an estimated 250 members (though the precise number of adherents is unknown).</p> \n<p>The group is known as the “Jewish Taliban” in the Israeli press because the women wear head-to-toe black robes, reminiscent of what women in Afghanistan had to wear during Taliban rule. The group’s name means “Pure Heart” and reflects the philosophy of Helbrans, who preached that members must purify themselves from the corrupting influences that defile the rest of the world – including other ultra-Orthodox groups, from which many of his followers came. He dictated a closely supervised, spartan way of life and rejected modern technology, going beyond the decrees of even the strictest ultra-Orthodox streams. He did share with them an anti-Zionist philosophy and a belief that the State of Israel is an evil and illegitimate entity.</p> \n<p>Twik and other relatives of Lev Tahor members charge that the cult keeps its members in line with cruel and extreme methods, including physical violence, psychiatric drugs, the removal of children from their parents and forcing underage girls to marry older men.</p> \n<p>Helbrans was born into a secular Israeli family. As a teenager, he became religious and joined the anti-Zionist Satmar Hassidic sect. In the late 1980s, Helbrans developed his own following, preaching the future apocalyptic destruction of the State of Israel and basing his predictions on biblical prophecies. In 1990 he moved his followers to the United States, and founded a yeshiva in Brooklyn. Four years later, he was convicted of kidnapping a 13-year-old who was sent to the yeshiva to study for his bar mitzvah by convincing him to become ultra-Orthodox, sever ties with his family and join Lev Tahor.</p> \n<p>After serving two years in prison for the crime, he was granted parole and moved with his followers to Monsey, New York, where he again ran a yeshiva, but the local ultra-Orthodox community became hostile toward the group. In 2000, the United States deported Helbrans back to Israel, but he and his followers soon moved to Quebec, Canada, seeking – and receiving – refugee status from the Canadian government. Helbrans claimed he was persecuted by Israel for his anti-Zionist views. The group remained in Canada for a decade, but their troubles with authorities followed them, with allegations of child abuse mounting over the years. In 2013 the scrutiny of the Quebec child protection services drove them out of that province and to Ontario, but they remained on the radar of Canadian authorities – and the Canadian media, which reported on their severe practices extensively.</p> \n<p>After several of the sect’s children were placed in foster care and it appeared that group's leaders would face criminal charges, members fled Canada in 2014, heading for Guatemala.</p> \n<p>After an initial stay in Guatemala City, the group moved to the village of San Juan La Laguna on the shores of Lake Atitlan, but they were soon forcibly driven out after clashing with the villages’ Council of Indigenous Elders. The town’s former mayor ended up with a year-long prison sentence for forcing them out of the town.</p> \n<p>After the expulsion, Lev Tahor members moved back to Guatemala City, but after authorities there raided the sect’s compound amid allegations of physical and mental abuse of their children in 2016, they moved once again, this time to Oratorio, a village 50 miles southeast of Guatemala City.</p> \n<p>On April 25, 2017 a ruling by an Israeli court declared that the sect was a “dangerous cult” that abused children. The court was petitioned by families of Lev Tahor devotees to increase pressure on the government to repatriate Israeli children living with the sect abroad and try to prevent others from being taken out of the country.</p> \n<p>Evidence showed “the Lev Tahor community treats the children of the community ... with severe physical punishment, with underage marriage ... with spouses who sometimes have age differences of up to 20 years,&quot; wrote Judge Rivka Makayes wrote in her decision. She added that “there is a punitive policy toward members of the community that includes the separation of children from their parents – even in infancy – and the transfer of children to be raised in another family; the prevention of formal education and isolation from the outside world and all external sources of information.”</p> \n<p>According to the Foreign Ministry, the mandate of the diplomat headed to Chiapas is strictly to confirm Helbrans' death, not to investigate the state of the Israeli Lev Tahor members there.</p> \n<p>Twik says Israel has turned a deaf ear to the appeals of families of Lev Tahor members over the years, and has not done enough to help the children he believes they have abused. He said that he “took the matter into my own hands” two years ago and “rescued” his family members by force from Guatemala himself after concluding that “the state wasn’t going to do anything.” Twik’s sister and her children now live in New Jersey. He said they were in “complete shock” at the news of Helbrans' death.</p> \n<p>He said he was not at all certain that the death of the group's founder would mark the end of Lev Tahor. Although the loss of the spiritual leader will cause “cracks,” Twik believes that overall, the organization is a “well-oiled machine,” and that other powerful members of the group, including Helbrans’ son Nahman, are capable of taking over the leadership role. He noted that during the times Helbrans was detained or imprisoned, the sect – made up mainly of Israeli and American Jews – continued to function.</p> \n<p>Israeli officials “should go there now, talk to the people, calm them down, check up on them. There are Israeli children there,” said Twik. “It’s a crazy group with crazy practices. I look at my family and they were abused badly – not just by Helbrans, but by powerful families in the group.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>December 23, 1940, is the birthdate of Jorma Kaukonen, guitarist extraordinaire, whose ongoing career has included membership in the Jefferson Airplane and Hot Tuna, plus collaboration with many other bands and musicians. Son of a father of Finnish descent and a mother whose parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants to the U.S., Kaukonen in recent years has reconnected with his Jewish heritage, largely by having accompanied his wife through the process of her conversion.</p> \n<p>Jorma Ludwik Kaukonen, Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., where his father, Jorma Ludwig Kaukonen, worked for the U.S. State Department. His mother was the former Beatrice Love.</p> \n<p>Joplin and the Typewriter Tapes</p> \n<p>During his earliest years, when his father was abroad during World War II, Jorma spent a lot of time living with his maternal grandparents, who spoke either Hebrew, Yiddish or Russian when they didn’t want him to know what they were saying.</p> \n<p>According to a long piece about Kaukonen by Wayne Robins, published in Tablet last year, his grandmother’s parents had lived on Rockville Settlement, a Baron Hirsch-sponsored Jewish agricultural project in north-central Connecticut, where they raised potatoes and tobacco. His great-grandfather, a Torah scribe named Samuel Levine, was an early leader of the synagogue attended by the family in nearby Ellington, Connecticut.</p> \n<p>When as a teenager, Jorma purchased his first electric guitar, it was with money that he had from cashing in Israel Bonds received from his grandmother.</p> \n<p>The family traveled a lot during Jorma’s youth, as his father, who specialized in labor affairs, served in U.S. legations in such countries as the Philippines and Pakistan, before returning to Washington. Jorma graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School there in 1959. It was at Wilson that he befriended and formed a band with Jack Casady, who was later the bassist for the Jefferson Airplane, and Kaukonen’s principal partner in Hot Tuna.</p> \n<p>Jorma attended Antioch College, in Ohio, before moving to California, where he enrolled in Santa Clara University, and began playing blues guitar in local clubs. In 1964, he accompanied Janis Joplin on a demo recording. Made at his home, the recording has come to be called the “Typewriter Tapes,” because of the typing of his then-wife Margareta that can be heard in the background.</p> \n<p>Jefferson Airplane takes off</p> \n<p>In 1965, Kaukonen was invited by his onetime Santa Clara classmate Paul Kantner to join a new band he and Marty Balin were organizing in San Francisco. They were soon joined by Jack Casady (Kaukonen’s suggestion) and Grace Slick, after original female lead Signe Toly Anderson left to have a baby.</p> \n<p>With these core members and a number of other changing personnel, Jefferson Airplane, as they called themselves, made music together until 1972. Kaukonen was lead guitarist and one of the lead singers.</p> \n<p>A few years later, he and Casady formed the blues-rock band Hot Tuna, whose changing members have grouped and regrouped continually for the past 45 years. One regular playing with Kaukonen since the early 2000s is mandolinist Barry Mitterhoff, who's also a regular member of the Klezmer Mountain Boys. Though not an observant Jew, Mitterhoff has served as a go-to guy for Kaukonen's Jewish questions.</p> \n<p>Such questions began to rise after Kaukonen’s wife, the former Vanessa Lillian, whom he married in 1988, had something of an epiphany when she and Jorma attended a concert by the Klezmer Mountain Boys at a small synagogue in Huntington, West Virginia, around the year 2000.</p> \n<p>“Something happened to me, so out of body, I started weeping,” she told Wayne Robins. “Not like somebody-died kind of crying, or I-hurt-myself crying, but it was so deep, like from 100 years ago. I told Jorma, ‘This is the same feeling I had when I met you. I feel like I’m home.’ ”</p> \n<p>A short time later, Vanessa got in touch with the Hillel rabbi at Ohio University, in Athens, Ohio, not far from the Fur Peace Ranch, the 115-acre farm where Kaukonen holds guitar workshops, and has a recording studio. Accompanied by Jorma, she underwent conversion with Danielle Leshaw, a Reconstructionist rabbi, and they have remained active in the Jewish community in Athens. They are also raising the daughter they adopted from China as a Jew. Her name is Israel; they call her Izze.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Since the years of the Common Era are labeled &quot;AD,&quot; standing for anno Domini or “in the year of the lord” in Latin, one might assume that Jesus was born in the Year 0. Specifically, he is commonly believed to have been born eight days before the New Year on December 25, 1 B.C.E. But this is very unlikely.</p> \n<p>For one thing, there is no year 0. The day following December 31, 1 B.C.E. is January 1, 1 C.E. And it isn't as though this system of accounting can be trusted anyway. It was devised by Dionysius Exiguus, a monk who hailed from what is now Bulgaria, in the year 525 C.E. (according to himself).</p> \n<p>Dionysius evidently thought he was writing 525 years after the birth of Jesus but nowhere does he explain how he came to this conclusion. Since there is no reason to think he had any information that we don’t possess today, let’s examine the facts ourselves.</p> \n<p>When Tiberius reigned</p> \n<p>The only record of the life and ministry of Jesus are the four Canonical Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Modern historians take these narratives with a grain of salt when examining historical Jesus, as the authors of these works were clearly more interested in theology than history; they were written quite a bit after the fact; and they contradict one another, themselves and other historic documents in both matters big and small.</p> \n<p>Still, these are the only documents that we, and indeed, Dionysius, have to go by.</p> \n<p>Luke tells us, somewhat indirectly, that Jesus was born during the reign of King Herod or shortly thereafter (1:5). Matthew tells us this directly: “Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king” (2:1).</p> \n<p>Since Herod died in 4 B.C.E., it seems that we can assume that Jesus was born that year or before.</p> \n<p>But modern historians aren’t convinced that this is necessarily so. It seems that Matthew set Jesus’ birth during the reign of Herod to allow for his account of the Massacre of the Innocents, an infanticide allegedly ordered by Herod (2:14), but lacking any historical corroboration, nor any mention in the other gospels. According to Matthew this leads Jesus’ family to flee to Egypt.</p> \n<p>So Jesus may or may not have been born during the reign of Herod the Great (37 B.C.E. to 4 B.C.E.). What other evidence do we have?</p> \n<p>Luke tells us “Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age” (3:23) and says that this was “In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar” (3:1).</p> \n<p>Since we know that Tiberius ascended the throne in 14 C.E., it is simple arithmetic to calculate when Jesus was born: Subtract 15 from 30, you get 15; now subtract this from 14, the year of Tiberius’ coronation, and you get 1 B.C.E. This is probably what led Dionysius to determine his accounting of the years.</p> \n<p>But Luke, who never met Jesus and likely didn’t know when Jesus was born anyway, doesn’t tell us that Jesus was 30 when he began his ministry, he says he was &quot;about&quot; 30, which means we could add or subtract a few years anyway.</p> \n<p>Luke also tells us (2:1-2) that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, not in the family home in Nazareth, because of the Census of Quirinius (governor of Syria), which required Joseph to return to his ancestral home.</p> \n<p>According to the Jewish historian Josephus, this census took place in 6 C.E.. That would mean that Jesus was born that year, or the next. Most historians think Luke got his facts wrong here.</p> \n<p>Bethlehem in winter</p> \n<p>All four of the canonical gospels agree that Jesus was crucified during the governorship of Pontius Pilate (26 C.E. to 36 C.E.). Since all four gospels agree on this, and since Pilate is an historic figure whose existence is corroborated by outside evidence, this can be taken as an historical fact.</p> \n<p>The problem is we are not told how old Jesus was when he died. The closest thing we have is Luke’s statement that he was about 30 when he started preaching.</p> \n<p>If we subtract 30 from the years of Pilate’s governorship we get a range from 7 B.C.E. to 6 C.E, which is probably the closest estimate we can reach.</p> \n<p>So we don’t know exactly what year Jesus was born, but at least we know he was born on December 25, right? Wrong. The gospels don’t provide us with a date nor even the season of Jesus’ birth. The only hint is a passage in Luke that at the time of the birth “in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night” (2:8).</p> \n<p>Some scholars have suggested that this means that Jesus could not have been born in the winter since in the region of Bethlehem, sheep would have been kept indoors during the cold winter nights. This claim is disputed by other scholars.</p> \n<p>The earliest indication that Jesus was born on December 25 is a calendar from 354 C.E., more than 300 years after his time.</p> \n<p>If early Christians knew the date of Jesus’ birth, it is somewhat strange that no record exists of such a thing before that date. It also seems rather convenient that Jesus’ birthday was December 25, which just happened to have been a festival day in the late Roman Empire for the sun god Sol Invictus.</p> \n<p>It seems most likely that this festival was transformed from a pagan holiday celebrating the rebirth of the sun to a festival celebrating the birth of Jesus. This is completely in keeping with the practices of the early church, which often chose to co-opt and reinterpret pagan practices rather than fight them.</p> \n<p>So it seems that we do not know when Jesus was born, not the date nor the year, but we can say it was probably sometime during the first decade C.E. or B.C.E.</p>",

For better and for worse, no single individual or group “runs” or “represents&quot;&nbsp;the U.S. Jewish community. One challenge we face:&nbsp;Too often, as a community we're unable to talk with each other, but rather we talk&nbsp;at one another. We rarely — if ever — attend the same events. And if we’re not in the same room, it’s rather difficult to share a common conversation.&nbsp;  If there’s been one truly diverse annual gathering of the Jewish community in recent years, spanning the communal and religious spectrums, it’s President Obama’s Hanukkah Party. There are those&nbsp;who focus on national security and foreign policy and others who are committed to domestic issues. Groups such as&nbsp;AIPAC, J Street, Bend the Arc, Conference of Presidents, T'ruah, JFNA,&nbsp;Chabad, URJ, Agudath Israel, USCJ, Orthodox Union, IKAR...&nbsp;and so many more, represented by their top leaders and their “plus ones.”&nbsp;We're talking primarily on the communal side but there has also been a degree&nbsp;of political diversity with several&nbsp;Republican Jews in attendance over the years (here and here). The White House seems to be the only house where all of our people gather.&nbsp;  Our favorite part of the Hanukkah party? The fairly egalitarian&nbsp;queue outside the White House as the Secret Service prepares to open the gates, with some waiting in line for hours. We liken it to our community’s version of a new product launch at the Apple Store. Everyone waits -- even Ambassadors and members of Congress -- and&nbsp;there are no special lanyards denoting status. So what are influential Jewish leaders waiting in line to do but shmooze with whomever is near them?&nbsp;For us, it's a highlight to observe the random pairings that would likely never occur, especially with any advanced planning.&nbsp;  The diversity of the White House Hanukkah Party is something to be proud of (and you can see it in the list below). Who knows what a Trump Hanukkah event will look like — aside from a gold menorah of course — but let’s hope it continues the&nbsp;tradition of bringing all segments of our community together — supporters and critics alike.&nbsp;  As for us at Jewish Insider and the Daily Kickoff newsletter, we’ll continue working hard to bring all of you together each day&nbsp;onto a shared platform -- doing our best to create and encourage a common conversation across the segments. If we succeed, and&nbsp;with your help we will, it'll be as if we're all in the same room together -- albeit&nbsp;for only 5 or 10 minutes at a time.&nbsp;Wishing you a very happy, very early Hannukah!  President Obama’s remarks at the first Hannukah reception yesterday: “The first chapter of the Hanukkah story was written 22 centuries ago, when rulers banned religious rituals and persecuted Jews who dared to observe their faith. &nbsp;Which is why today we are asked not only to light the menorah, but to proudly display it -- to publicize the mitzvah. And that’s why we’ve invited all these reporters who are here Through centuries of exile and persecution, and even the genocide of families like the Wiesels endured, the Hanukkah candles have been kindled. Each wick an answer to the wicked.&nbsp;Each light a signal to the world that yours is an inextinguishable faith I want to say how much Michelle and I appreciate the opportunities to have celebrated so many Hanukkahs with you in the White House. You know, at the beginning of my presidency, some critics thought it would last for only a year. But -- miracle of miracles -- it has lasted eight years. It's lasted eight whole years.

Resistance Builds to John Bolton as State Dept. Deputy&quot; by Jeremy Peters and&nbsp;Maggie Haberman: &quot;Mr. Tillerson has expressed misgivings about having Mr. Bolton as his deputy, according to a person who has spoken with Mr. Trump in recent days. But Mr. Bolton remains under consideration for the job. And he enjoys a powerful ally in Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and Republican megadonor who favors the kind of hard-nosed posture that Mr. Bolton would bring. Mr. Adelson’s backing has gone an especially long way with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is expected to take on an important but still undetermined role in the new administration...&nbsp;“I like John Bolton and hope he gets a senior position,” said William Kristol... “But the Trump people shouldn’t kid themselves that any selection as deputy would erase the deep concerns about Tillerson of those of us who believe we can’t afford to continue Obama’s policy of supineness to Putin.&quot;&quot;&nbsp;  -- &quot;Another name that has been mentioned as a possible deputy to Mr. Tillerson, according to two people with knowledge of the transition process, is Elliott Abrams, a former Bush adviser.

He would be useless as the head of Exxon if he did not have a working relationship with Russia.” Citing his acquaintance with Tillerson from serving together on the board of a Washington-based think tank, Kissinger praised Trump’s selection and added that &quot;we should not think about these relationships as the personal relationship of individuals.&quot; [Bloomberg; Politico]  Rabbi Shmuley Boteach: &quot;Tillerson can influence Arab governments to recognize Israel:&nbsp;Given that peace with the Palestinians is a fantasy, Tillerson can use his ties with the Gulf states, now with the backing of the United States government, to encourage and, if necessary, pressure them make peace with Israel and establish diplomatic ties.&quot; [TheHill]&nbsp;  &quot;Sources: Ivanka Trump to have East Wing office&quot; by&nbsp;Sara Murray&nbsp;and&nbsp;Daniella Diaz: &quot;Trump transition aides are already planning for an &quot;Office of the First Family,&quot; in the East Wing where the current office of the first lady is located, sources familiar with the plan told CNN. Melania Trump is still expected to play a role in the White House. However, Ivanka is expected to have a prominent slot as well. A source said she is likely to play the part of Washington hostess as well as advise her father on issues including family leave to climate change... Titles for Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have not been determined. But Kushner, a publisher and businessman, is expected to have his own role outside of the family office -- the latest indication that he could be bound for the West Wing.&quot; [CNN] &nbsp;&quot;Other ethics experts said Kushner might be able to dodge conflict-of-interest laws by becoming a government contractor, rather than a Trump staffer.&quot; [CNN]  &quot;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner house-hunting in Washington&quot; by Richard Johnson: &quot;Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are house-hunting in Washington, DC — but not as quickly as commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, who already bought a $12 million mansion near the vice president’s residence.&nbsp;Sources say Ivanka and her husband are looking in Ross’ neighborhood as well as Georgetown, and might be seeing the same houses Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is eyeing. Luxury Listings NY reported Wednesday that Ivanka had put her Trump Park Avenue apartment on the market for $4.1 million.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;The French-chteau-style manse that Ross and his wife, Hilary Geary, bought sits on an acre across the street from Penny Pritzker, the current commerce secretary.

Chief Rabbis Step Up As Ivanka Takes Stage” by Michele Chabin:&nbsp;“In fact, a source with ties to the Trump transition team told The Jewish Week that high-ranking transition officials were concerned over questions about the legitimacy of Ivanka Trump’s conversion and even raised the issue with Israel. “An approval by the Chief Rabbinate is seen as making for a closer personal relationship between the Trump family and Israel, and it is a step that is warmly welcomed,” the source quoted a transition team official as saying.” [JewishWeek]&nbsp;  &quot;Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem Only Requires New Sign on Consulate Building, City Officials Say&quot; by Nir Hasson:&nbsp;&quot;City planning officials shrug that there’s no need to build anything new to house the embassy in the Israeli capital: The Americans built a big new consulate in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Arnona, which had been planned in advance to be converted into the actual embassy one day.

[Businessweek] &nbsp;What's next for Jared Kushner's Gowanus development site? [BrooklynEagle]&nbsp; Donald Trump Strikes Conciliatory Tone in Meeting With Tech Executives [WSJ]  SPOTLIGHT: &quot;Israel’s Coffee King Takes on Starbucks With $1-a-Cup Franchise&quot; by Yaacov Benmeleh and Illya Krennikov: &quot;Founder Avi Katz, who started the chain in Israel in 2013 and now is the country’s biggest coffee-stand operator, has big plans. In addition to Russia, he’s planning to expand into the other two top branded-coffeehouse markets in Europe: the U.K. and Turkey. He’s also about to open New York and Madrid offices for Hagshama Fund, his $650 million real estate investment firm.&nbsp;Katz, 54, says he’s counting on the Cofix model: Strip out the chairs and waiters. Sacrifice space and price for volume. Most importantly, find places where the difference between what people pay in shops and what it costs to make coffee at home is huge. Then drastically undercut the competition.&quot;  “A new market is opening up to those who couldn’t afford outside coffee,” said Katz, wearing jeans and a blue polo shirt, a small knitted yarmulke on his bald head. “And for those who already can, they save money. This is my revolution.”&nbsp;Born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Bnei Brak, he left religious seminary for boarding school at age 14. He still devotes 15 hours a week preparing his Wednesday sermon, delivered in his packed living room in Kfar Saba, and is writing an introduction to a book about Ayn Rand. A passage from Genesis in which Jacob professes his unworthiness of all that God has given him is painted in black above the sofas in his corner office at Hagshama headquarters in Petach Tikva, an industrial town east of Tel Aviv.&quot; [Bloomberg]  KAFE KNESSET --&nbsp;Dress Code Outrage -- by Amir Tibon &amp; Tal Shalev:&nbsp;The most fervent political discussion in Israel in the last 48 hours wasn't about the upcoming budget, the controversial land appropriation bill, or the future of the nuclear deal with Iran. Instead, it was about skirts.&nbsp;Dozens of female staffers working for members of Knesset from various parties staged a protest yesterday at the entrance to Israel's parliament, after a number of them were turned there by security guards who claimed that they weren't properly, or modestly, dressed.&nbsp;Israelis are not known worldwide for being formal dressers. But the fact that only female workers have been delayed or stopped in the name of the dress code sparked quite the debate.&nbsp;  The Knesset's spokesman bashed the protest as &quot;an orchestrated provocation that does not show respect for anyone,&quot; and the Director General is trying to broker a compromise with the aides--so far without success. Merav Michaeli from the Zionist Union told Kafe Knesset: &quot;We're standing at the Knesset's entrance because our aides will not have their skirt measured – and rightly so. The fact that the director general didn’t even bother to come out and speak with the dozens of agitated workers outside the Knesset and deal with the crisis alone testifies to his unwillingness to reach a solution.&quot;  BIRTHDAYS:&nbsp;Polish-born violin prodigy who lived in London and then Miami, recording artist, performer and teacher, Ida Haendel turns 88...&nbsp;Film, stage and television actress and voice artist, best known for her role in the 1990s Fox sitcom &quot;Parker Lewis Can't Lose,&quot; Melanie Chartoff turns 66...&nbsp;Associate Lecturer in Religious Studies at the University of Wyoming, where he has been teaching about Islam and the Middle East since January 2003, Seth Ward turns 64...&nbsp;CEO and founder of BizBash, a resource marketplace for event organizers, David Adler turns 63...&nbsp;Leader of the opposition in the South African National Assembly (1997-2007), then South African ambassador to Argentina (2009-2012), Tony Leon turns 60...&nbsp;Actress and singer, and songwriter, appeared in the title role of the 1984 film Supergirl,&quot; Helen Slater turns 53...&nbsp;Television and movie producer, screenwriter and executive, producer of the first eight seasons of the Pok&eacute;mon TV series and writer of most of the Pok&eacute;mon films, Norman J.

        "text":["<p>Among the news that slipped under the radar while we were preoccupied by the major fires and various affairs, I was shocked to hear that the Home Front Command is establishing a whole system for evacuating communities on Israel’s northern border to prepare for the possibility that Hezbollah will take them over.</p> \n<p>It’s important to understand what this means: A guerilla group will conquer civilian communities in a sovereign state. What once sounded impossible and a figment of our imagination has now become a real possibility, as if we had gone back to the days of the War of Independence. We residents of the north have been under threat of rocket and Katyusha fire for 40 years – and now we have to deal with the possibility that they will actually take over border communities?</p> \n<p>It is good that the Israel Defense Forces is preparing for any eventuality – that’s its job, but there’s a deeper problem here: Once again we are being dragged after threats, trying to find localized tactical solutions to broad strategic problems. Are we under missile fire? We’ll open Iron Dome. Are there attack tunnels? We’ll invest billions in a system that identifies underground excavation. In the end the enemy will find his own solutions and the methods will only become more sophisticated.</p> \n<p>I’ve been covering the IDF’s actions in Lebanon since 1978 and if I’m sorry for anything, it’s that I didn’t keep all the newspaper clippings and recordings in which leading defense officials “conveyed forceful messages” to the other side. How many adamant threats we heard, how many puffed-up boasts, how many empty promises to the inhabitants of the north. If 10 percent of those declarations had been carried out, we would have no problems on the border because Lebanon would no longer exist. In any case Hassan Nasrallah was not overly impressed by them.</p> \n<p>And yet over four decades we here in Kiryat Shmona and the whole Galilee, enjoyed two periods of complete peace and quiet on the northern border. The first was in June 1999, when during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s first term in office, then-Defense Minister Moshe Arens decided on an operation in which the air force bombed a variety of civilian targets at night in Lebanon. Two main power stations east of Beirut were bombarded, along with two bridges on the Lebanese coastal road and an important communications facility. The operation was able to create deterrence and led to a long period of relative quiet, as opposed to years in which heading down into the shelters had become almost the norm.</p> \n<p>The second period of quiet is of course now. A decade after the Second Lebanon War, we can still argue over the way the forces were fielded and how the war was managed, but not over its outcome: an unprecedented period of quiet for northern communities and a real possibility for growth in the region. (Why isn’t this happening? That’s another story.)</p> \n<p>The common denominator is clear: Israel broke the accepted equation and initiated action that was surprisingly disproportionate, action that had nothing to do with a specific event, as in “the IDF returned fire to the sources of the fire,” but rather looked at the situation in general. If we needed more proof of the success of this method, we got it when Nasrallah himself conceded that he would not have acted if he had known that Israel would respond the way it did.</p> \n<p>Now, with the return of fearsome scenarios on all fronts and they promise that if Hamas launces an attack it will be its last against Israel, I snicker. After all, for Hamas, a strike against Israeli civilians is useful – another means of exerting international pressure. Hamas doesn’t really care about them and no confrontation is necessary to understand this.</p> \n<p>In the face of the chaos in Syria it’s also hard to figure out effective action, with even the elements with power in that torn country are not always able to know who’s fighting whom.</p> \n<p>Actually, on the Lebanese front, facing off against what appears to be the strongest enemy on our border, things are clearer. If Nasrallah knows that when he goes back to firing rockets into Israel the power station adjacent to the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp will be leveled and the electrical systems on the Beirut-Tripoli road will be destroyed, he’ll think twice. In fact, he has already thought twice, and that’s the power of deterrence.</p> \n<p>Lebanon’s citizens are of course not to blame and are not the target. But if such a strike shortens the conflict, prevents a major bloodbath and creates conditions for long-term peace and quiet, we have no other option. No nuclear submarines or new F35s are needed for this; reservists don’t even have to be called up. All that’s needed is a change of perception, and sometimes that is precisely what is most difficult to do.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There is no pleasant way of saying this: At the moment there is nothing appetizing about the future plate of food that awaits humanity. The food of the future will arise from resource shortages, demographic increases and pangs of conscience – not exactly a recipe for gourmet culinary pleasures. The meals that will be served to our offspring and future generations will be laden with nutritional considerations and will consist of sophisticated substitutes for food as we know it.</p> \n<p>It's possible this food will be healthier and we might take consolation in the thought that it’s all about acquired tastes, but we’d best come to terms with the fact that this is the direction we're heading.</p> \n<p>Alongside grasshopper delicacies, cricket tidbits and other six-legged protein, there is also the question of the future of meat for consumption. To the chagrin of its opponents and the abstemious, meat is still the main element in world food consumption. We humans spend about $750 billion annually on meat, compared to $330 billion on milk and dairy products and about $280 billion on fruits and vegetables.</p> \n<p>However, ever since the first lab hamburger was introduced to the world four years ago, the idea of “cultured&quot; meat has begun to take on sinew and flesh. The idea of producing real meat – not a substitute – from animal cells in the laboratory without harming the animals themselves or causing them to suffer is no longer a fantasy. It is currently being developed in startups and research institutions, arousing interest in the meat industry and among investors and government bureaucrats. The international race to create cultured meat of sufficient quality and reasonable price has begun. It's possible that when next Independence Day rolls around, we will place juicy lab-grown steaks on the grill, steaks grown without bloodshed and without harming any animals.</p> \n<p>Last month Uma Valeti, the founder and CEO of Memphis Meats, announced with great excitement that a year after the company made history by launching its first (cultured) meatball, it did it again by successfully producing chicken and duck.</p> \n<p>San Francisco-based Memphis Meats is probably the most advanced company in the cultured meat field. However, even if the taste and texture of Valeti’s lab schnitzel trounces the local schnitzel joint’s, it costs over $18,000 per kilogram. This is far more expensive than the schnitzel we known and love, but significantly less expensive than the first lab hamburger, which debuted in April 2013 at the cost of $325,000 for a 140-gram patty.</p> \n<p>Lab cookout</p> \n<p>Israel is also a major player in the field of cultured meat, though nothing is ready for the supermarket shelves yet. On May 7, the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa will host the first Israeli international conference on the topic of cultured meat, aptly named “Future Meating.” The guest of honor will be Prof. Mark Post from Maastricht University in Holland, who presented the first cultured hamburger. Also expected is the chief scientist of Tyson Foods, the second-largest chicken meat supplier in the world which provides its products to chains like McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken. Among the conference's local sponsors are Soglowek Food Industries and Strauss Israel, which along with the Innovation Authority at the Economy and Industry Ministry established a food-tech incubator for entrepreneurs in the food industry about two years ago – the Kitchen FoodTech Hub.</p> \n<p>The conference was initiated by the Modern Agriculture Foundation, which was established in 2014 with the aim of promoting and supporting research to implement the idea of cultured meat. According to Dr. Yaron Bogin, the executive director of the nonprofit, “The field of cultured meat is in its infancy and thus far worldwide investment in it has been at most a few million dollars. What we do, broadly speaking, is that we take a sample of cells from a cow or a hen, put them into bioreactors [the apparatus used for growing cells], add nutrients [chemical compounds essential for the growth of living beings] to them, cause the cells to divide and multiply and then we turn them into muscle cells, harvest them and make meatballs from them.” According to him, the problem is that “they still haven’t come up with the ability to grow cells with all the elements of the tissue.”</p> \n<p>No prototype of cultured meat exists in Israel as of yet, but they are definitely working on it. With a little faith and luck, Haifa will be able to take pride in cultured steaks produced by the Technion along with its famous Shawarma Hazan meat restaurant.</p> \n<p>One of the conference participants is Prof. Shulamit Levenberg, dean of the Technion’s biomedical engineering department, where a team of researchers she heads has recently begun to develop cultured meat based on cattle cells. The team doesn't intend to stop at a clump of cell culture formed into a meatball. They are going for the real thing: steak. At the end of the process they intend to produce a succulent lab steak untainted by animal suffering, equal in taste and texture to the genuine article.</p> \n<p>“We have been working for many years now on creating muscle tissue for medical purposes, for replacing and repairing defects, with an emphasis on complex tissues consisting of a number of types of tissue,&quot; says Levenberg, an expert on tissue engineering. &quot;The main challenge is to replace the materials suited for medical applications of tissue engineering with materials suited for food.” That is, what is good for repairing defects and injuries in stomach or thigh muscles could one day show up for lunch.</p> \n<p>Growing meat in an apple</p> \n<p>They have also taken up the challenge at Tel Aviv University. Prof. Amit Gefen of the biomedical engineering department is growing meat cells in apples; he is currently trying to find the variety of apple best suited to the task. He began working in the field after conducting feasibility studies for developing cultured meat for the Modern Agriculture Foundation two years ago. They have parted ways since then, but he opted to continue his academic research. According to Gefen, “Experience accumulated abroad shows that it is possible to grow cells from a mammalian source on apples because of the structure of their porosity. The pores are sort of niches that provide the mammalian cells with a protected habitat in which the biological processes necessary for one day becoming a tasty piece of steak can occur.”</p> \n<p>These attempts show the complexity of meat and how difficult it is to replicate. Taking a cell sample and creating a culture that will make it possible for the cells to “do their thing,” as it were, is far from sufficient; the whole process requires intervention.</p> \n<p>The main difficulty is growing a “thick” meat tissue – that is, finding a solution to the absence of blood vessels, which carry oxygen and much else to the depths of real meat tissue. This is essential in order to create the texture of real meat and not just a thin layer of meat cells in a lab Petri dish.</p> \n<p>Post created the first lab hamburger after experiments with mouse and pig cells. He took stem cells from the muscle tissue of a cow and from them he produced satellite cells that repair damaged tissues. He grew them in a culture rich with growth materials and hormones. After the cells multiplied, Post transferred them to a dish with collagen, which served as an armature and then “starved” the cells, stimulating a reaction that caused them to become linked muscle cells.</p> \n<p>Afterward, another process was needed to create resistance and apply pressure to the meat filaments in order to “develop muscles” and give them a texture similar to that of animal flesh. Then the flat coverings of muscle cells on the armatures were cut into very thin strips, from which Post made the patty itself. To make the lab hamburger look like the real thing, he added beet juice and spices and saut&eacute;ed it in a considerable amount of butter because it didn't contain any fat cells. The process took about three months. At the end, the patty was served to tasters who said it was “close to meat.”</p> \n<p>A dish with an agenda</p> \n<p>The challenge of transforming a cell culture to real tissue is forcing researchers to focus on the search for a suitable armature (that is, a growth medium). Gefen chose apples as an armature but potatoes, yams and asparagus are also being considered. “It isn’t enough that the material be porous – the cells need to connect to each other,” explains Gefen. “We sowed apple cells. For them to be ready to accept the cells, first we needed to treat them. It's a complicated story.”</p> \n<p>He explained his choice to work with quail meat – as opposed to the popular chicken or beef – by his preference for concentrating on the kinds of cells that have been less studied until now, and because it's used in haute cuisine. “These developments are costly, at least in our day,&quot; says Gefen. I don’t think the cultured meat will be sold to McDonald’s or KFC. It will be served with an agenda, and in specific places. It's important to remember that this is in its infancy and we aren’t going to be seeing cultured meat in restaurants or shops in the next several years, unless it's for public relations for commercial purposes.”</p> \n<p>SuperMeat is another Israeli effort in the field of cultured meat. Last summer the startup raised about $230,000 in a crowdfunding campaign online. Founded at the end of 2015 by Ido Savir and Koby Barak, formerly of the Modern Agriculture Foundation, SuperMeat has set the production of cultured chicken meat as its goal. The decision was based on the research of Prof. Yaakov Nahmias of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, another one of SuperMeat's founders.&nbsp;Nahmias has since parted ways with the company and established an independent start-up, Future Meat Technologies, which develops lab-grown meat technology.</p> \n<p>The crowdfunding campaign garnered public interest and media coverage but no product or prototype has been launched so far. Its founders are maintaining a veil of secrecy. “We are now at the stage of an investment round,&quot; Savir tells Haaretz. &quot;We have a large team of researchers and all I can say at this point is that our aim is to come out with accessible cultured meat products within five years.” He is not concerned that Memphis Meats has already presented cultured meatballs and chicken and duck nuggets. “The idea is always based on the same principle: to grow cells or tissue. But the ways to get there are varied and there are tons of possibilities and technological directions,” says Savir. “At the ideological level, there is no doubt that cultured meat is the direction in which the world should be heading.”</p> \n<p>Practically speaking, cultured meat still has a long way to go before it reaches the plate, but there are already those who are investigating how the public would take to the idea. In a Belgian study published in 2015, only 13 percent of the participants were familiar with the concept. After they received basic information, most expressed positive views: 43 percent stated they would be willing to try the new food. Only 9 percent completely rejected the idea. Two big deterrents for cultured meat came up in the study: the high cost and unfulfillment of consumers’ expectations. The researchers concluded that it would be best to wait with the meat as long as possible and only produce and market it when it is feasible to do so at a reasonable price. Only this way would it win the hearts of future consumers.</p>",

        "text":["<p>What exactly does the new law change?</p> \n<p>The law allows Israel to expropriate private Palestinian land in the West Bank where Israeli settlements or outposts have been built.

Isn’t the West Bank occupied anyway?</p> \n<p>The law crosses a line Israel has never violated before, even according to right-wingers like former Likud minister Dan Meridor, who called the law “evil and dangerous.”&nbsp;He points out that Israel's Parliament never regulated Palestinian property ownership in the West Bank because “the Arabs of Judea and Samaria did not vote for the Knesset, and it has no authority to legislate for them. These are basic principles of democracy and Israeli law.”</p> \n<p>If Israel is to be fully sovereign in the West Bank, he contends, it would have to allow the Palestinians there citizenship and grant the right to vote. Until then, he says, Israel’s authority to regulate land in the West Bank is limited only to doing so for security purposes&nbsp;–&nbsp;under both Israeli and international law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Does Israel’s attorney general agree?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yes. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has declared that if the law is challenged in court, he won’t defend it against arguments that it violates the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p> \n<p>This hasn’t deterred Israel’s far-right Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, a senior member of the party Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home), the driving force behind the law. She says that if it becomes necessary, a private attorney will represent the government in a court battle that most legal experts expect to end in an invalidation of the law.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How many settlements will the law affect?</p> \n<p>According to Peace Now, the law will allow for the retroactive legalization of land in more than 50 outposts and settlements so far.</p> \n<p>In 16 of them, demolition orders have already issued against homes built on land claimed by Palestinian owners. Under the new law, any action to implement these orders will be frozen for a year pending proceedings to determine whether the state may seize the land.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This includes properties in the settlements of Ofra, Eli, Netiv Ha’avot, Kokhav Hashahar, Mitzpe Kramim, Alon Moreh, Ma’aleh Mikhmash, Shavei Shomron, Kedumim, Psagot, Beit El, Yitzhar, Har Bracha, Modi’in Illit, Nokdim and Kokhav Yaakov.</p> \n<p>The law came too late to save the illegal outpost of Amona, which was evacuated last week.</p> \n<p>What do you mean by “so far”? Would the law, if passed and upheld, allow settlement on private Palestinian land in the future?</p> \n<p>Potentially, yes. The measure would empower the justice minister to add more settlements and outposts to the list of areas where property may be seized from Palestinians, with the approval of the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.</p> \n<p>Are the Palestinian landowners who have settlers living on their land compensated? And if so, how?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Under the new law, Palestinian landowners get a choice: if possible, they are given an alternate plot of land. If not, they will be paid an annual usage payment of 125 percent of the land’s value as determined by an assessment committee for renewable periods of 20 years. Unless, in an optimistic scenario, a peace deal happens that involves removing Israeli settlements from their land.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why does all of this sound really familiar? Hasn’t the government been fighting over this for a long time?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The bill passed its initial legislative hurdles in November and December, but was subsequently deferred and postponed for various reasons. The primary reason has been Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s concerns over the late-term moves of the Obama administration (and indeed, Obama aides have held the law at least partially responsible for its UN Security Council abstention) and its fear of getting off on the wrong foot with the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>The law has been pushed hard by Education Minister Naftali Bennett. When Bennett first introduced it, Netanyahu called his haste &quot;childish and irresponsible&quot; and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Bennett that he was &quot;endangering the future of the settlement enterprise on an electoral whim.&quot;</p> \n<p>So why was it revived and why the last-minute late-night vote on Monday?</p> \n<p>Netanyahu was told by the Trump administration not to take any significant moves before his scheduled meeting with the president on February 15. He’d used this to make the case for delaying the Monday vote at a meeting with coalition party leaders a day earlier. But Bennett and Shaked, under tremendous pressure from their base to forge ahead with it after Amona was dismantled, refused any more delays.</p> \n<p>Unable to stop the law any longer, all Netanyahu could do was “brief” Trump&nbsp;–&nbsp;let him know it was coming, on the same day he had to hear from British Prime Minister Theresa May that the law would be “unhelpful” and would make things more difficult for Israel's friends. And&nbsp;–&nbsp;presumably to save face with his right-wing supporters whom Bennett clearly hopes to woo away from him&nbsp;–&nbsp;Netanyahu backtracked, denying he had tried to delay the vote.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s a well-known obsession of power-hungry political leaders that has now reached the prime minister’s people in Jerusalem. It’s called Deep State, an old and dangerous conspiracy theory. It’s similar to other conspiracy theories spread by the boisterous right &agrave; la Yair Netanyahu’s anti-Semitic cartoons, though this conspiracy theory is also fed by the absurd garbage running around the internet.</p> \n<p>Deep State is a hidden and terrifying entity that promotes interests without taking into consideration the elected leaders at all. Prime minister? Ministers? Parties? They’re all just puppets. The real power brokers are hiding in the shadows. According to an old theory in the United States, this shadow government sits in the UN basement. According to a different theory that has been popular for a long time, these are the Elders of Zion who control the world.</p> \n<p>Now it turns out that Israel too has a Deep State, with arms like an octopus, that’s working to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In an article in Israel Hayom, Amnon Lord wrote that the “attorney general and police commissioner are being pushed into the despicable work of carrying out a coup against the government.”</p> \n<p>“The political-media oligarchy that has persecuted Netanyahu for 20 years is unwilling to accept its losses at the polls and is trying to force the law enforcement authorities to carry out a putsch,” Lord wrote. “Under the guise of ‘fighting corruption,’ they are trampling the will of the voter and democracy.”</p> \n<p>The fact that Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit and Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich were both appointed by Netanyahu doesn’t change anything. They are pawns in the service of the hidden oligarchy. Sometimes it’s called “the elites,” “the media” or the New Israel Fund.</p> \n<p>In the United States, right-wing media outlets such as Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News use Deep State to prove conspiracy theories in “X-Files” style. The main claim is that this hidden entity is operating to bring down Donald Trump, and any means are acceptable: leaks, fake news and of course investigations.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, a Breitbart story stated: “Now the Deep State has a name – the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Dick Morris and Eileen McGann wrote that “we now know that the FBI has been overtly biased in favor of Hillary Clinton and her associates and overly zealous in its investigation of Donald Trump and her associates.</p> \n<p>“The G-men have gone rogue.</p> \n<p>“In fact, recent reports suggest the FBI now serves as the command center of the Deep State, aptly housed in the J. Edgar Hoover Building.&nbsp;The iconic former director would undoubtedly approve of their questionable tactics.”</p> \n<p>When you remember how just before last year’s election, the FBI pulled out the Clinton email affair again, you can only laugh. Bannon didn’t invent anything. The conspiracy theory of the state within a state has been common for years in Egypt, Turkey and Russia – all of them great examples of democracy. It’s an effective tool for repressing political opponents.</p> \n<p>How is legitimate opposition possible to such wonderful and benign leaders as Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Netanyahu? After all, the citizens are meant to admire them eternally. It’s clear that this is a conspiracy of hidden forces. That’s how a legitimate political fight is turned into a “coup” and every investigation is labeled a putsch.</p> \n<p>Are there powerful forces working behind the scenes to influence governments around the world? Of course. But are Mendelblit, Alsheich, prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari, police investigations chief Meni Yitzhaki and their colleagues in the Netanyahu cases acting in the service of hidden forces to overthrow Netanyahu? Certainly not.</p> \n<p>The truth is, they have no special enthusiasm for sensitive cases against top politicians. In fact, the gatekeepers aren’t effective enough. They drag their feet and find it hard to conduct investigations against the people who oversee them, especially when these people don’t recoil from making personal attacks against the officers enforcing the law.</p> \n<p>Here’s a rule of thumb. When the people around a political leader begin to talk about a “coup attempt” by hidden forces, it’s a tactic to delegitimize their opponents and muffle accusations. People who have confidence in themselves and their actions don’t attack government bodies they're&nbsp; responsible for but express confidence in them.</p> \n<p>Such an attack is bankrupt leadership. If the prime minister derides the police, what can the lowliest of criminals say?</p>",

A pure heroine of culture, void of any foreign political considerations, not to mention delusional ones,” Regev said.</p> \n<p>The New Zealand Jewish Council responded to the cancellation by its local music icon.</p> \n<p>“We are deeply disappointed that Lorde has succumbed to a small but loud group of extremist bullies. Boycotts of Israel will not lead to peace. Those who advocate them are not interested in negotiations between the two sides to this conflict or a two-state solution,” spokesperson for the Council, Juliet Moses, said.</p> \n<p>“By cancelling her show, Lorde has sided with those who support the isolation and demonization of the one Jewish state in the world. She has ignored the moderate voices, including the vast majority of Jewish Kiwis, who believe in dialogue and co-existence, and the leading musicians like Radiohead, Nick Cave, Guns N Roses and Justin Bieber who have performed in Tel Aviv in the last year.&nbsp;She will still be performing in Russia, but no one accuses her of complicity with Putin, the occupation of the Crimea or chemical warfare in Syria,” Moses also said.</p> \n<p>Producer Eran Arieli in a&nbsp;post&nbsp;Sunday night on Facebook apologized to fans and said: “I was naive to think an artist of her age could handle that pressure.”</p> \n<p>He added: “It’s important to me that the end of the day we will thank her for considering us and giving us the opportunity in the first place, and also apologize to her, she doesn’t deserve all the shit she’s been through in the last week since the announcement.

        "text":["<p>When John Lydon arrived in Israel to play a gig with Public Image Ltd in the summer of 2010, he was asked his thoughts on bands that agreed to play in Israel but then pulled out. &quot;I think it's disgusting,&quot; the ex-Sex Pistols front man said in typically forthright fashion. &quot;I think they shouldn't have agreed in the first place if they were gonna back out in the second. I'm here to say, 'People of Israel, I support you 100 percent. As for your government, they can fuck off!'&quot;</p> \n<p>There are various reasons why bands cancel concerts in Israel. Sometimes it's pressure from the boycott, sanctions and divestment movement. Sometimes it's the outbreak of a war or an Israeli military action. And sometimes it's something as mundane as low ticket sales.</p> \n<p>Following Lorde's decision not to perform in Israel next June, here are 8 more instances of performers who faced the music and dropped their Israel gigs:</p> \n<p>The Pixies</p> \n<p>&quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; sang American alt-rock legends in 1989, but the band wasn't so keen to come to Israel in July 2010 – weeks after the Israeli army's botched raid on a Turkish flotilla ended in nine deaths and widespread international condemnation.</p> \n<p>&quot;We'd like to extend our deepest apologies to the fans, but events beyond all our control have conspired against us,&quot;&nbsp;the band said, without explicitly mentioning what those events were. &quot;We can only hope for better days, in which we will finally present the long awaited visit of the Pixies in Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>This band was actually true to its word, finally playing Israel in June 2014. Its timing was only slightly better this time, though, with the Gaza war breaking out a few weeks later. The band also returned last July.</p> \n<p>Elvis Costello</p> \n<p>The British songwriter may have risen to fame in the 1970s with &quot;(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea,&quot; but it was his not wanting to go to Israel that generated headlines in 2010.</p> \n<p>He canceled two gigs in Caesarea, saying it was ultimately &quot;impossible to look the other way&quot; about Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. &quot;Sometimes a silence in music is better than adding to the static,&quot; he added, something he himself might have considered before releasing his country &amp; western album in 1981.</p> \n<p>Costello's stance annoyed Israeli music promoter Marcel Avraham, who told Ynet later that year, &quot;He knew all about Israel before he decided to have a show here, signed the contract and suddenly decided not to come. The man just hasn't liked Israel for years and that's something people need to understand.&quot; Still, at least Costello didn't send in &quot;Oliver's Army.&quot;</p> \n<p>Santana</p> \n<p>Guitarist Carlos Santana played Israel in the late 1980s, but his cancellation of a Tel Aviv concert in June 2010 was shrouded in more mystery than the deaths of Spinal Tap drummers.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;official reason was the band's &quot;tight schedule,&quot;&nbsp;which forced it to drop some destinations from the itinerary. But the Israeli promoters smelled a rat. &quot;Our clarifications revealed that [Santana] received messages from anti-Israel figures who pressured him to cancel the performance,&quot; a source told Ynet. &quot;Of course, no one there claimed any connection between these pressures and the show's cancellation, but we are certain there is a very close connection.&quot;</p> \n<p>Santana did eventually smooth over his differences with Israel, returning six years later to play Tel Aviv's Hayarkon Park.</p> \n<p>Lana Del Rey</p> \n<p>In Israel, the definition of an optimist may well be the person who's held onto their original ticket for Lana Del Rey's planned August 2014 concert in Tel Aviv, with the expectation that she&nbsp;will one day make good on her promise to perform here. Even by the laidback standards of her Californian sound, three-plus years is a pretty long time to reschedule.</p> \n<p>In fairness to Del Rey, the show was one of a spate of cancellations due to that summer war in Gaza. But while the Backstreet Boys and Megadeth made good on their promise to play in Tel Aviv once the coast was clear, Del Rey and another no-show, Neil Young, have been absentees – proving once and for all that life really does suck if you're a live music fan in Israel.</p> \n<p>Natalie Imbruglia</p> \n<p>Here's where cancellations get complicated. Did the Australian one-hit wonder cancel her March 2017 concert in Tel Aviv due to political pressures or more prosaic ones?</p> \n<p>The promoters said Imbruglia canceled due to &quot;logistical difficulties.&quot; But while disgruntled fans (let's be kind and use the plural) doubtless jumped on her records, BDS activists jumped on her decision, hailing it as a victory in their boycott battle – citing the Facebook book they'd set up to convince the former Aussie soap star to cancel. Where does the truth lie? Frankly, we're torn.</p> \n<p>Manfred Mann's Earth Band</p> \n<p>A band's decision to cancel a gig is sometimes seized upon by BDS activists as proof that the movement's pressure has paid off. But sometimes there are times when a band's comments allow for zero ambiguity. One such incident featured Manfred Mann's Earth Band, which delivered a string of pop hits in the 1960s and one painfully honest statement about why it was canceling its January 2016 gig in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>&quot;Due to the present ongoing problems in Israel with all the recent shootings and people getting kicked to death in public, etc, the band do not feel safe or secure with the idea of playing Tel Aviv,&quot; its statement said, adding, &quot;And as the ticket sales are also not very good, it is in everybody’s best interests that we cancel the show now.&quot;</p> \n<p>Gil Scott-Heron</p> \n<p>A year before his death in 2011, soul-jazz performer Gil Scott-Heron canceled his performance in Tel Aviv (we're certain those two facts are unconnected). Unusually, he announced his decision live on stage, on the opening night of his 2010 world tour.</p> \n<p>Tensions had reportedly been running high in that concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, with activists from the Gil Scott-Heron Boycott Israel Campaign picketing the venue beforehand. A handful of activists then continued their protest during the gig itself, before Scott-Heron finally addressed the elephant in the hall before the final song.</p> \n<p>His world tour would end in Athens, not Tel Aviv, he announced, adding that he would not be playing Israel &quot;until everyone is welcome there.&quot; His premature death 13 months later put an end to those peace pipe dreams.</p> \n<p>Thurston Moore</p> \n<p>Has anyone had a more tortured relationship with Israel than the ex-Sonic Youth guitarist? His New York rock band played Tel Aviv in 1996, but he was well and truly woke when he announced the cancellation of his band's scheduled Israeli performance in 2015.</p> \n<p>With a verbosity suggesting he might not be the go-to guy for protest banners, part of Moore's statement declared: &quot;The choice to play in Tel Aviv, while a boycott based on principles of non-violence exists, initiated for me an active study and contemplation in which emerged an enlightenment of personal judgment.&quot;</p> \n<p>Along with Roger Waters, Moore has since become the voice of the artistic boycott of Israel. So much so that we hear he can often be found discouraging customers from buying hummus at his local deli.</p> \n<p>And 8 musicians who refused to pull out of Israel gigs...</p> \n<p>Some musicians bow to BDS, some turn a blind eye to BDS and some go out of their way to give BDS the finger. These artists came to Israel despite getting a ton of shit from Thurston Moore, Roger Waters et al:</p> \n<p>Radiohead; Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds; Madonna; the Rolling Stones; Sia; Elton John; Rihanna;&nbsp;Britney Spears; Justin Bieber; and Depeche Mode.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Everything is very complicated.” With this quote from a former chancellor as a metaphor for Austrian politics, Martin Engelberg, one of Austria’s first Jewish postwar members of parliament, starts his recent Haaretz op-ed (Don't Fixate on the Freedom Party. In Austria Today, the Real anti-Semitic Threat Is From Muslims, Not Nazis).</p> \n<p>This statement may be true for lots of issues; however, some situations are not complicated at all. For a Jewish politician, condemning the entry of a far-right party into government, should be obvious.</p> \n<p>In Austria, Engelberg argues, the only real threat for Jews comes from Muslims. Neo-Nazis are a ghost from the past, he writes, therefore the coalition government between his conservative party and the far-right Freedom Party (FP&Ouml;) should not be problematic for Austria’s Jews.</p> \n<p>As the elected representatives of Austria’s Jewish students, we wholeheartedly disagree. The Freedom Party is not, and never will be, a viable option as a partner in government.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Austrian Freedom Party (FP&Ouml;) indeed established itself as a homestead for former Nazis,&quot; Engelberg states, with which we concur. The FP&Ouml; has never became a &quot;normal&quot; populist movement – if there is such a thing. The Freedom Party remains anti-Semitic and racist to its core.</p> \n<p>For instance, the current leader, Austria’s new vice-Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, was arrested in 1989 in Germany for taking part in illegal activities with a forbidden neo-Nazi Group, ‘Viking Youth.’ 41% of the FP&Ouml;s parliamentarians are members of &quot;Burschenschaften&quot;, far-right, anti-Semitic, German nationalist fraternities. Many still have an &quot;Aryan clause&quot;, which bars everyone they do not consider as &quot;German&quot; from membership, including Jews and all other minorities.</p> \n<p>Countless other anti-Semitic incidents involving Freedom Party&nbsp;members and officials, including some of its incoming government ministers, are matters of public record; listing them all would not just fill an op-ed, but a whole newspaper.</p> \n<p>From our point of view, this track record of anti-Semitism and bigotry alone should be more than enough to condemn and distance oneself from such a group. In spite of these widely-known issues, Engelberg argues that the far-right does not pose a threat anymore.</p> \n<p>So let’s have a look at some numbers. In its recent annual report on extremism, the Austrian federal office for the protection of the constitution states the following: &quot;There is a dramatic rise and an all-time-high for crimes with far-right, racist, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic motivation.&quot; Hate crimes increased 54.1% compared to last year.</p> \n<p>Although I am much younger than Engelberg, I have myself experienced my fair share of far-right anti-Semitism in my 21 years living in Vienna, encountered anywhere from football stadiums to university campuses.</p> \n<p>It is therefore a dangerous fallacy to suggest the problems of far-right anti-Semitism have &quot;disappeared.&quot; Austria never confronted its Nazi past, as Germany did. It took Austria until 1991 to officially acknowledge its crimes during World War II. By belittling the dangers of right-wing ideologies, Engelberg involuntarily helps those forces that wish to stop &quot;the fixation on the Holocaust&quot; once and for all.</p> \n<p>It is true that the far-right is not currently using anti-Semitism openly as a political weapon. Currently, fanning the flames of Islamophobia is increasingly politically opportune.</p> \n<p>On the contrary, the FP&Ouml; panders to Jewish communities and Israel under the pretext of an ostensible ‘common enemy’, as the examples of the government program Engelberg cites, clearly demonstrate.</p> \n<p>We oppose a legitimization of the FP&Ouml; on these grounds and see through the charade. The FP&Ouml; has not ceased to be anti-Semitic, it has merely come to appreciate that it’s politically inadvisable at this time to publicly foster hate against Jews. So it sends mixed messages, reassuring the anti-Semites in its base via publications and codes.</p> \n<p>Aula, a newspaper close to the party, defamed surviving concentration camp prisoners as a &quot;national plague.&quot; The speaker of the new FP&Ouml; Ministry of Internal Affairs is the editor of unzensuriert.at, a paper resembling the far-right Breitbart News in the U.S.</p> \n<p>Engelberg writes, “It's no longer a cogent argument to claim that, if for now the rightists have turned on the Muslims, they will eventually turn on the Jews again&quot;, but on what grounds he makes this assertion remains unclear. On the contrary, we believe exactly this is exactly the scenario that will play out, as countries where right-wing populism has already succeeded show.</p> \n<p>One of Strache’s role models is Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban. He explicitly says that Austria should take Poland and Hungary as examplars. In Hungary, the government is currently involved in an ongoing anti-Semitic campaign, in Poland,&nbsp;&quot;There has been a distinct normalization of anti-Semitism&quot;, according to European Jewish Congress president Moshe Kantor.</p> \n<p>In both countries, the situation for Jews is rapidly deteriorating. Being recognizable as a Jew on the streets leads to hostility, even assaults. In the U.S., after Trump’s election, members of the Ku Klux Klan and so-called alt right feel that they have enough support to walk through cities, shouting &quot;Jews will not replace us&quot;, before killing a woman protesting against their hate.</p> \n<p>There is a clear trend in countries where right-wing populists come to power: Nazis start crawling out of their holes again. Suddenly it becomes legitimate to spew their hateful ideologies publicly. Unfortunately, the same will happen in Austria. ‘Our’ Nazis have a similar tradition.</p> \n<p>We do not only oppose the Freedom Party solely on the grounds of their poorly-disguised anti-Semitism. Rather, we refuse to be complicit in fostering hate against minorities and refugees. It would be shameful and short-sighted to condone the defamation of a people or religion simply because it is not ours. Not long ago, we were refugees and our people experienced the consequences of xenophobia. Almost no other country helped us. Historically, Jews have a moral duty to combat hate and racism, no matter who falls victim.</p> \n<p>We can never &quot;kosher&quot; the FP&Ouml; or those who work hand in hand with them. The Freedom Party should not be part of Austria’s government. We must work together with those who oppose power-sharing with Nazis and we must do our utmost to oppose them. There is indeed a &quot;full schedule&quot; ahead of us.</p> \n<p>Benjamin (Bini) Guttmann is the elected co-President of the Austrian Union of Jewish Students (J&ouml;H), which represents young Jews between 18-35 in Austria.

        "text":["<p>STOCKHOLM – Last Yom Kippur, the Nordic Resistance Movement, a Swedish neo-Nazi organization, held a march in Gothenburg, Sweden’s second-largest city, that drew hundreds of participants. According to the local media, the group, which also maintains a presence in other Nordic countries, has grown stronger in the past few months, and evidence suggests that it is part of a larger pan-European trend. Parallel to the strengthening of neo-Nazis in Sweden, support for far-right movements of all types is being seen across the Continent. Some of the movements are represented in their countries’ respective parliaments, others are engaged primarily in disseminating their ideology through alternative media, and on the margins there are also organizations that resort to violence.</p> \n<p>This phenomenon is not confined to Europe alone. Many supporters of the white supremacy concept and other European nationalists are now making common cause with the American alt-right movement. The political bloc they are forging threatens not only advocates of multiculturalism and socialists, feminists and environmentalists on the left, but also conservatives and libertarians, on the right.</p> \n<p>Sweden, it turns out, is one of the centers of the new European right, even though it is better known for its high level of solidarity and social equality, and as a country that cultivates policies based on democratic values, human rights and generosity to asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>Yet, for almost 100 years now, Sweden has been home to a plethora of racist, nationalist and fascist movements. The political establishment in Stockholm may be occupied with embracing universalist values and creating a social-democratic state, but extreme right-wing groups have been operating on the margins of Scandinavian society for years: from neo-Nazis and skinheads to anti-Semitic publishing houses, heavy-metal bands promoting racist values, and movements flaunting pre-Christian imagery that promote nationalist and anti-establishment ideas.</p> \n<p>The Swedish journalist and writer Elisabeth &Aring;sbrink probed the reasons for Sweden’s centrality in the European far-right scene in her book “1947: When Now Begins.” &Aring;sbrink chronicles key figures and events that shaped the new world order and postwar Europe. One of the more fascinating individuals she portrays is Per Engdahl (1909-1994), the man who led the Swedish fascist movement.</p> \n<p>“Engdahl was an intelligent and modern person,” &Aring;sbrink said in an interview with Haaretz. “He was a fascist activist during the war, and after the war ended he understood that he would have to change his ways, so that the fascist and Nazi ideas would not die,” she relates.</p> \n<p>“Already in 1945,” she continues, “he connected the remnants of fascist and Nazi movements from all over Europe. He made contact with Oswald Mosley’s fascists in England, with the French fascists, the Swiss Nazis and Hitler’s loyalists in Germany. He was in close touch with MSI, the Italian Social Movement, which continued Mussolini’s path in the dictator’s country, and he himself founded a Danish Nazi party. His network also included Nazis from Norway and Holland, and the postwar advocates of the Iron Cross party in Hungary. Together they formed a secret network whose center was in Malm&ouml; [Sweden], where Engdahl lived.”</p> \n<p>The network, later known as the Malm&ouml; Movement, played a central role in the rehabilitation of Europe’s extreme right.</p> \n<p>To begin with, according to &Aring;sbrink, Engdahl created an escape route for Nazis from all parts of Europe. It passed through northern Germany and Denmark, and led to Malm&ouml;. From there the Nazis were smuggled to various places in southern Sweden and then sent by ship from Gothenburg to South America. In some cases these Nazis returned to West Germany, where the American authorities were releasing hundreds of S.S. men every day because they were unable to cope with the expenses of detaining the overload of fugitives. Engdahl claimed to have “saved” about 4,000 Nazis in this way.</p> \n<p>One of those who assisted Engdahl was Johann von Leers (1902-1965), who had been Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels’ right-hand man and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and himself a leading ideologue of the Third Reich.</p> \n<p>“Von Leers arrived in Malm&ouml; in 1947, and then disappeared,” &Aring;sbrink notes. “No one knows exactly how, but in the end he got to Buenos Aires, where he edited a paper that became a communications channel between Nazis in Europe and those who ended up in Latin America. Von Leers was later brought to Egypt under the auspices of Haj Amin al-Husseini, with whom he was in close contact. Eventually he converted to Islam and changed his name to Omar Amin as a gesture to his benefactor, becoming head of [Egyptian President Gamal Abdel] Nasser’s ‘Israeli’ propaganda unit.”</p> \n<p>The close ties between Nazis like von Leers and the Palestinian national movement is one of the stories that connect the European right of the 1940s and 1950s to contemporary political dramas. But the link runs deeper.</p> \n<p>“Engdahl founded a network of international nationalism,” &Aring;sbrink says, adding, “Until then, nationalism bore a local character. Engdahl turned it into an international movement. The network’s first conference was held in 1950, in Rome. Engdahl, a polyglot who taught himself Italian for the occasion, spoke at the gathering and wrote the network’s charter, dealing with the future of Europe. The central idea was that Europe would be a white continent, with no foreign elements – Jews and blacks – and no democracy, which he termed a feminine, weak type of regime. The network advocated government that was autocratic, masculine and strong, and its members believed that Europe was entitled to support itself with overseas colonies.</p> \n<p>“The core of the network’s central idea,” &Aring;sbrink continues, “recalls concepts that the contemporary far right is focused upon, such as theories of a Muslim takeover of the world and the ideas that appear in the manifesto of Anders Breivik [the Norwegian terrorist who massacred 77 people in 2011]. Rome was followed by a conference in Malm&ouml;, in 1951, where the Malm&ouml; Movement was effectively born, with Engdahl, one of its four leaders, being appointed a kind of international secretary general. The Malm&ouml; gathering also gave birth to the movement’s magazine, Nation Europa, edited by two former Waffen S.S. officers, which transmitted the organization’s ideas across the generations. Old-school Nazis contributed to the magazine, but later were joined by a new generation of writers. One of them was a young Frenchman named Jean-Marie Le Pen.”</p> \n<p>&Aring;sbrink mentions another young writer, a German named Henning Eichberg, who was the first to talk about ethno-pluralism, the idea of separation of different ethnicities which influenced many of Europe’s new right movements.</p> \n<p>Racism without 'race'</p> \n<p>Sweden thus became an important arena for renewal of Nazi and fascist ideas after the progenitors of those concepts had been defeated by the Allies in the war. While Nazi criminals were hanged or committed suicide in Nuremberg, and the world, seeing the results of Nazism, promised “Never again” – others were ensuring that the Nazi idea would carry on. Already in the 1950s, a new right began to take shape in Sweden and on the margins of European society. The movement created an alternative history for itself, and a morality that was the opposite of what was emerging in other, newly created postwar international organizations.</p> \n<p>“One of the leaders of the Malm&ouml; Movement was a French fascist, Maurice Bardeche [1907-1998]. Bardeche published a book that constituted the basis of all of the so-called ‘revisionist’ arguments used by Holocaust deniers to this day,” &Aring;sbrink relates. “He and Engdahl understood something very important: that the word ‘race’ was no longer usable after the genocide of World War II. They replaced it with the word ‘culture.’ The ideas are the same, but when you talk about ‘culture’ rather than ‘race,’ you can talk about ‘my culture and your culture and how the two cultures cannot coexist.’ Engdahl created a new language. It’s racism without the word ‘race.’ In a note that Bardeche wrote in the 1960s, he pointed out that this was an important change, because right-wing movements could now espouse racist ideas and call themselves anti-racist.”</p> \n<p>&Aring;sbrink adds that within a few years of the founding of the Malm&ouml; Movement, members were leaving because they considered it too prone to compromise and thought its messages were vague. It was these breakaways who, effectively, established the white supremacy movement in Europe. Those who remained in the organization, on the other hand, laid the foundations for the extreme right that is now part of the European parliamentary system.</p> \n<p>“There are many influences on the development of the European right since Engdahl,” &Aring;sbrink says. “In the 1960s and ‘70s, they were actually influenced by the views of the critical left about the United States and about colonialism. In the 1990s, they were influenced by American Nazis who imported the ‘ZOG’ theory, which maintains that it’s legitimate to use violence against police officers and other representatives of government, because the political establishment is an emissary of the so-called ‘Zionist Occupation Government.’</p> \n<p>“These ideas are more extreme than the original ideas of Engdahl and his colleagues,” &Aring;sbrink continues. “Engdahl’s principal role was to keep Nazi ideas and movements alive until the arrival of the next generation – which thought they were slightly outmoded and not aggressive enough, so they updated and radicalized them.”</p> \n<p>Ikea’s Nazi founder</p> \n<p>How was it that Sweden, a relatively marginal country in terms of population that hadn’t even taken part in World War II, became a key base for the postwar European right? &Aring;sbrink offers a variety of explanations. One element lies in the fact that Sweden was not occupied and did not suffer directly the disastrous results of Nazism. &Aring;sbrink notes both the traditional Swedish fear of the Russians and Swedes’ problematic attitude toward their country’s Jews, who had suffered from discrimination for many years. Moreover, a deep connection existed between Swedish elites and Nazi Germany (including the royal family and such wealthy families as the Wallenbergs).</p> \n<p>An example of these relations is found in a secret that &Aring;sbrink herself exposed in an earlier book. She discovered that Ingvar Kamprad, the founder and owner of the Ikea home furnishings empire, was an active Nazi. Although Kamprad’s involvement with the fascist movement was already known, &Aring;sbrink discovered that he was also a member of the SSS, the Swedish hard-core Nazi party during the war, and that the Swedish secret police had him under surveillance because of it. She recounts that in an extremely rare interview he gave to her, in 2010, Kamprad, who is today 91, asserted his conviction that Engdahl was “a great man, and I will claim that as long as I live.”</p> \n<p>Engdahl, she says in summation, “is a kind of icon whom the present-day extreme right revere and from whose ideas they draw inspiration.”</p> \n<p>But how do the followers of the European new right view the Malm&ouml; Movement and Engdahl’s legacy?</p> \n<p>“The continuity between the old right and the modern nationalist movement is very weak,” says Daniel Friberg, a key figure in the Swedish new right and in the world alt-right movement. In more than 20 years of being active politically, Friberg says, he has never received any kind of support from the members of the political movements of the previous generation.</p> \n<p>“Engdahl’s movement was relatively marginal, and its members tended to be very rich people, like Ingvar Kampfard,” he maintains, adding, “They despaired and gave up, and we had to rebuild everything. I funded the first magazine I published, when I was 18, from my personal savings. I feel no respect toward the old men of the old right. They were cowards and weak, they backed off easily and they lacked the tenacity to continue the struggle. Perhaps they are exaggerating their importance for narcissistic reasons, but they never helped establish the modern nationalist movement.”</p> \n<p>Friberg doesn’t belong to the traditional right-wing establishment in Sweden, and is not a member of any of its parties. Nevertheless, he is a very central figure in the Swedish new right and in its link to the international alt-right. He terms himself a supporter of the identitarian movement, which sprang from the French new right and espouses ethno-pluralistic beliefs. Identitarianism, a key element of the global alt-right movement, assails the concept of multiculturalism, opposes migration and supports ethnic- and culture-based separation. Its opponents claim that its ideology contains fascist and neo-Nazi elements.</p> \n<p>Friberg’s centrality stems from the fact that he founded a large number of Swedish and European alternative-right organizations, and also because he is responsible, along with American alt-right leader Richard Spencer, for bridging between the movements on both sides of the Atlantic in the form of the website altright.com. According to Friberg, the trans-Atlantic project is growing, and draws inspiration from another website of the American far right, Breitbart, whose executive chairman is former Trump adviser Steve Bannon.</p> \n<p>The alt-right site is only one of Friberg’s projects. He also founded, and continues to manage a publishing house called Arktos, which promotes a far-right agenda, and has put out 150 titles in 15 languages. He was a partner in the founding of Metapedia, a right-wing alternative to Wikipedia, and recently he also founded the Nordic Alternative-Right movement together with a former senior figure in the Sweden Democrats, a populist right-wing organization.</p> \n<p>Friberg, 39, engages in what he calls meta-politics. “Parliamentary politics doesn’t interest me,” he says. “I influence society in the same way that Haaretz does in Israel. I’m engaged in media, books, newspapers, magazines and websites, and that’s what I’ve always done.”</p> \n<p>According to Friberg, this political activity is significant, because it reveals the truth that’s hidden from the public by the establishment and mainstream media. As an opponent of mass migration, particularly into Europe – which he claims causes a considerable increase in violent crimes, including rape – he argues that the true reality is concealed by a political establishment that kowtows to political correctness, and by a self-censoring mainstream media. That, he says, is the main reason for the flourishing of alternative media in Sweden, and it’s also why Sweden has become so important in the world new-right scene. There’s a large disparity, he says, between the country’s left-wing government and the public’s support for the right.</p> \n<p>“It’s simply a matter of supply and demand,” he says. “People want to know the truth.”</p> \n<p>‘Return to normality’</p> \n<p>The vision of Friberg and his supporters is remarkably similar to that of the Malm&ouml; Movement of six decades ago. It avoids racist language, but advocates racial separation, and it is nationalistic, autocratic and conservative. It talks about a “return to normality” and the need to put an end to what Friberg&nbsp;calls “the failed social experiment of multiculturalism, feminism and cultural Marxism, which has caused so much suffering to Europeans in the past 50-60 years.” He also maintains that it’s essential “to protect national and regional identities and to return to tradition, including the traditional roles of the sexes.”</p> \n<p>In his younger days, Friberg used the pen name “Daniel Engdahl,” in homage to Per Engdahl, but despite this, and despite the similarity between Friberg’s ideas and those of the neo-Nazi movements of the mid-20th century, he is meticulous about differentiating his views from Nazism. He denies allegations that he was a skinhead in the past and a member of a Nazi movement.</p> \n<p>“There are very few neo-Nazis in Europe today,” he says. “As for myself, I never believed in fascism and never described myself as a neo-Nazi. There are even some who accuse me of being a Jew or a Zionist, of not being anti-Semitic enough and of trying to hijack the Swedish nationalist movement. Maybe that’s because my surname ends in ‘berg.’ In any case, I don’t really care what people call me on the internet.”</p> \n<p>“Berg” or no “berg,” an examination of the publications and statements of alt-right figures, including those published by his website and his press, turns up many types of anti-Semitism. There is Holocaust denial of different kinds, and there are Jewish-domination conspiracy theories. These phenomena are largely limited to the virtual world, but in some cases they penetrate the “real world,” too. A well-known example is the speech by Friberg’s American colleague Richard Spencer following the U.S. presidential election in November 2016. Spencer concluded his remarks with calls of “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” Many in the audience responded with the Nazi salute.</p> \n<p>Friberg does not deny the existence of anti-Semitism in the new right, but he does not consider himself an anti-Semite, and offers many explanations for the phenomenon.</p> \n<p>“It is perfectly obvious that the incident with Spencer was a joke,” he explains. “I was present at the event. It was an excellent speech, and the end was a kind of amused response to the liberal narrative about Trump. After all, Spencer has criticism of Trump, and he would not seriously salute him. At the end of the proceedings, a few people in the audience saluted ironically in the Nazi fashion, in response to the fact that Trump is presented in the media as a fascist and a Nazi. Spencer himself regrets the incident.”</p> \n<p>More broadly, Friberg views right-wing anti-Semitism as an oversimplification of complex issues. “I do not condemn revisionist history of the Holocaust period,” he says. “I acknowledge the suffering of the Jews in World War II. But the war as a whole, not only the Holocaust, was the most tragic event in Europe for centuries. Not only the Jews suffered in it. German children and women, too, were murdered and raped by Russian soldiers, and 10 million Ukrainians were starved to death in genocide. But despite this, we learn only about the Holocaust; no one taught us about the Holodomor [the Ukrainian term for the ‘Great Starvation’ in that country during the 1930s]. The lives of the Jews are not worth more than the lives of non-Jews, and the suffering of others also deserves recognition.”</p> \n<p>Friberg does not believe in an all-embracing conspiracy theory that attributes magical powers and world rule to the Jews, but various versions of such theories are present in works that he publishes. “There is no one conspiracy theory,” he says. “There are many such theories, Jewish and not Jewish alike. That’s clear, after all. There’s conspiracy in every commercial company that’s led by three people, two of whom try to get rid of the third. That’s the nature of politics. It’s a dirty game, and the Jews, like others, are on all sides.”</p> \n<p>At the same time, Friberg argues, there is an over-representation of Jews in social-change movements that have caused damage worldwide. Jews like George Soros, who promotes a liberal, globalist vision, are examples of that tendency. But there are also other Jews. Benjamin Netanyahu, he says, is a Jew who represents a more nationalist agenda, and there are also other Jews, including some Israelis he knows, who support the new right.</p> \n<p>“In Sweden, for example, the biggest supporters of opening the borders and of the multicultural social disaster were Jews who emigrated from Poland,” he says. “That’s a pattern and we must not ignore it. But there are also Jews on the other side. For example, it was [the American philosopher and historian] Paul Gottfried, a Jew, who invented the term alt-right, along with Spencer.”</p> \n<p>Friberg is right. No few Jews back the new right in Europe and the United States. Some others hold positions of power in Israel and cultivate close ties with their colleagues who urge deportation of foreigners, the building of walls and racial separation, and call for a struggle against “leftist elites” in the media and in academia.</p> \n<p>The European and American new right, like the Israeli version, is neither apologetic, nor is it in hiding. It’s articulate, it has ties with big money and it is accumulating power and influence. It looks toward the future but its feet are planted deep in the neo-Nazi movement of the mid-20th century. Its Israeli supporters would do well to watch the clip of Spencer’s speech a year ago, and reflect on the comments of Friberg. In the video they will see a room filled with men enthusing over the battle cries of a white race that is being plundered by other races, which are taking over its living space. They applaud when the speaker alludes to the media as “L&uuml;genpresse” (the lying media), the German term used by the Nazis, and laugh when he calls its members inhuman and soulless. At the end they respond to the cries of “Hail!” with loud applause and the Nazi salute.</p> \n<p>Daniel Friberg maintains that this should be taken ironically, that it’s just a joke. Given the fact that some of these people are so close to power in so many places around the world, all we can do is hope he’s right.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When Mordechai Ben Ari, the CEO of El Al, Israel’s airline, was invited by Boeing in the mid-1960s, along with airline executives from around the world, to view the mock-up of the interior of company’s planned “Jumbo Jet,” he felt that he was being asked to peer into an imaginary world.</p> \n<p>At the time he didn’t believe an aircraft designed to carry up to 500 passengers would be economically feasible or that it would ever be built. And he certainly did not imagine the small airline he managed would ever fly such behemoth.</p> \n<p>But a few years later, he would make the decision to purchase new Boeing 747s and convinced his shareholders, the Israeli government, to approve what was at the time the biggest investment by any Israeli government-owned company.</p> \n<p>El Al announced this week that one of its Boeing 747-400s, is being taken out of service.</p> \n<p>Twenty-three years after the 4X-ELE Rishon Le’Tzion, first took to the skies — originally in the colors of Singapore Airlines (El Al bought the plane second—hand in 2008) — it is now headed for scrapyard. The jumbo jets were the first in El Al’s fleet to each be given names for a different Israeli city.</p> \n<p>This is the second 747 El Al is taking out of service this year. Four more are still in service, flying mainly to North America, and the four remaining ones are scheduled to be phased out in 2018, replaced by the smaller, more fuel-efficient Boeing 787s. One 747 freighter will remain in service for cargo flights. But 48 years of passenger flights to Israel in jumbo jets will come to an end. No other airline currently flies the 747 to Israel and none is likely to in the future.</p> \n<p>Along with El Al, most of the world’s airlines are phasing out these massive four-engined monarchs of the sky, in favor of cheaper, smaller and much more boring winged buses with two engines.</p> \n<p>United Airlines ended its 747 flights last month and Delta flew its last jumbo jet a week ago. The icon of America’s aerospace industry is no longer flying passengers in any US-flag carrying airline. Passengers at Ben Gurion Airport will still catch an occasional glimpse of the Jumbo’s hump at the cargo terminal and there are still two derelict 747s by the runways, used for, among other things, training special-forces in hostage rescue situations. But 2018 will be the last year in which they can actually still fly one.</p> \n<p>The more pragmatic-minded will be glad to see the 747’s departure. In many ways, they were a nightmare to fly as a passenger. While some airlines configured their Jumbos in more comfortable layouts, El Al always seemed to be looking for ways to stuff more seats in to the economy class and never dig get around to fixing the entertainment consoles.</p> \n<p>Landing in a 747 at Ben Gurion (especially if more than one of them was landing at the same time) usually meant an interminable wait for luggage as the baggage-handlers were swamped. Residents of the suburbs directly beneath the flight path will be relieved at not waking up every time the midnight flight to New York takes off, with its four massive rumbling engines. And secular passengers on long-haul flights may also sleep better in a plane less conducive to holding successive prayer minyans.</p> \n<p>But more romantic travelers will miss the jumbo — that exhilarating feeling when those 400 tons of metal, fuel, humans and cargo finally, almost unbelievably, raises in to the air after lumbering down the runway for what seems like forever. And the knowledge that (unless you are a fighter-pilot or had the privilege of flying in the supersonic Concorde back in its day) you will never be moving as fast as a Boeing 747 can fly. The new Airbuses and Boeing Dreamliners may be more advanced, safe and friendly to the environment, but they will never be as majestic as the magnificent Jumbo. And the misshapen Airbus 380 “Super Jumbo” will never be as exciting. Unlike the 747, it has been a commercial flop.</p> \n<p>And no aircraft in history revolutionized travel, or made the world smaller, for so many people like the 747.</p> \n<p>For El Al, the decision to go ahead and purchase the first jumbo, when it had yet to enter service with any other airline, was seen as a daring move. But it was approved by the government in 1969, largely because there was a feeling in the newly expanded Israel, after the conquests of the 1967 Six-Day War, that a new era was coming. More Jews from around the world were interested in visiting Israel and though for most Israelis at the time, a trip abroad was still an unthinkable luxury, there was a feeling of greater prosperity down the road.</p> \n<p>El Al had entered the jet age and began flying Boeing 707s in 1960, but the decision to double the capacity with the jumbo felt the right thing for a larger and more self-confident Israel. It was a major event at the time, the airline redesigned its logo for the arrival of the jumbo and a sign went up over its Tel Aviv headquarters with the number of days remaining to its arrival. Prime Minister Golda Meir and Transport Minister Shimon Peres took part in the arrival ceremony of the first aircraft on July 3, 1971.</p> \n<p>Beyond its size, the 747 wasn’t that much of a technological innovation over the 707. Only when the more capable 747-200 entered service in 1973, could El Al inaugurate for the first time full non-stop services to New York (the flight from New York to Tel Aviv, at the time longest scheduled passenger flight in the world, had been non-stop since the early 1960s, but the strong winds flying west, meant that until the 747-200’s arrival, flights the other way had to make a stopover for refuelling).</p> \n<p>Just like in other countries where it flew, El Al’s jumbos had a knack of playing their role in historic moments. Many reserve soldiers who were in the United States on Yom Kippur, October 1973, rushed to John F. Kennedy Airport, trying to get a seat on the first El Al Jumbo there, so they could join their units in battle. Even Benjamin Netanyahu, then a student at MIT, recorded his frustration at not getting on that first jumbo, in his book A Place Among the Nations. That was just one of many special flights chartered by the government, which included flights in aid of rescue operations in the wake of disasters around the world.</p> \n<p>The most memorable flight will always be the one in which an El Al 747 broke the world record for the largest number of passengers ever to fly on one plane. On May 24, 1991, 1,088 people flew from Addis Ababa to Tel Aviv, as part of the Operation Solomon airlift in which 14,400 Ethiopian Jews were evacuated from the war—torn country (actually, 1,087 boarded that flight, but a baby was born after take-off). It may have also been the fastest boarding of a jumbo in El Al’s history. It took only 40 minutes to load the plane and there was no need to call the names of stragglers still looking for last-minute bargains in the duty-free shops.</p> \n<p>There were less proud moments, such as when El Al jumbo jets had to be painted in all-white schemes, for flights to countries where an Israeli jet could have arouse unwelcome attention. And there was the loss of Flight 1862, a 747 freighter which crashed after taking off from Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport on October 4, 1992, killing all four on board and 39 on the ground. The crash was followed by mysterious reports of men in white coats at the site and rumors of a dangerous cargo that had been on board.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1990s, El Al replaced its early 747s with the newer 747-400s, but as they near the end of their service lives, the company has decided, like nearly all other airlines in the world, not to purchase the third generation 747-8 (which has been chosen by only three airlines for passenger services and is unlikely to remain in production) and instead downsize in favor of a more flexible and cheaper to operate 787s.</p> \n<p>This makes perfect economic and environmental sense, but at least some of us who will be flying from Israel to the United States in 2018 will carefully choose their schedule, so we can one last chance to head off into the skies on this this truly historic aircraft.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering a proposal that could lead to potentially designating Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.</p> \n<p>The officials said several U.S. government agencies have been consulted about such a proposal, which if implemented would add to measures the United States has already imposed on individuals and entities linked to the IRGC.</p> \n<p>The IRGC is by far Iran’s most powerful security entity, which also has control over large stakes in Iran’s economy and huge influence in its political system.</p> \n<p>Reuters has not seen a copy of the proposal, which could come in the form of an executive order directing the State Department to consider designating the IRGC as a terrorist group. It is unclear whether Trump would sign such an order.</p> \n<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran denies any involvement in terrorism.</p> \n<p>Several draft orders on other topics have been circulated among U.S. agencies, only to be rejected or postponed by the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>Reuters reported last week that officials were debating whether to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, but that decision appears to have been indefinitely postponed.</p> \n<p>Naming Iran's single most powerful military and political institution as a terrorist group could have potentially destabilising effects, including further inflaming regional conflicts in which the United States and regional arch-rivals blame Iran for interference. Iran denies those allegations.</p> \n<p>It would also likely complicate the U.S. fight against Islamic State in Iraq, where Shi’ite militias backed by Iran and advised by IRGC fighters are battling the Sunni jihadist group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some of Trump’s more hawkish advisors in the White House have been urging him to increase sanctions on Iran since his administration began to take shape. After tightening sanctions against Iran last week in response to a ballistic missile test, White House officials said the measures were an “initial” step.</p> \n<p>U.S. Gulf allies have long favored a tougher U.S. stance against Iran, whom they blame for regional interference.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But officials said the process for issuing potentially controversial orders has slowed considerably in the wake of the political and legal uproar over Trump’s order to ban entry to the United States from seven majority-Muslim countries, which is now the focus of a federal appeals court battle.</p> \n<p>The United States has already blacklisted dozens of entities and people for affiliations with the IRGC. In 2007, the U.S. Treasury designated the IRGC’s Quds Force, its elite unit in charge of its operations abroad, “for its support of terrorism,” and has said it is Iran’s “primary arm for executing its policy of supporting terrorist and insurgent groups.”</p> \n<p>A designation of the entire IRGC as a terrorist group would potentially have much broader implications, including for the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and the United States and other major world powers.</p> \n<p>The nuclear deal, which has been harshly criticized by Republicans in Congress and Trump for giving Iran too much and not placing tight enough restrictions on the country, granted Iran relief from most Western sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program.</p> \n<p>Reuters reported last week that the IRGC designation is among the proposals being considered as part of an Iran policy review in the Trump administration. The objective would be to dissuade foreign investment in Iran’s economy, because of the IRGC’s involvement in major sectors including transportation and oil. In many cases, that involvement is hidden behind layers of opaque ownership.</p> \n<p>“The new administration regards Iran as the clearest danger to U.S. interests, and they've been looking for ways to turn up the heat,&quot; said a senior U.S. official who has been involved in what he called a broad review of Iran policy.</p> \n<p>The official said that rather than tearing up the nuclear agreement, a step he said even Israel and Saudi Arabia oppose, the White House might turn instead towards punishing Iran for its support for Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and some Shiite forces in Iraq, as well as covert support for Shiites who oppose the Sunni regime in Bahrain, and cyber attacks on Saudi and other Gulf Arab targets.</p> \n<p>But sanctioning the IRGC could backfire, this official warned. It could strengthen the hardliners and undercut more moderate leaders such as Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and encourage Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria to curtail any action against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and perhaps even sponsor actions against U.S.-backed or even American forces battling Islamic State in Iraq.</p> \n<p>The Revolutionary Guards answer to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, whose power far surpasses that of Rouhani.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Iranians will not take any U.S. action lying down,&quot; said the official. &quot;They may not act quickly or in the open, but there is a danger of an escalating conflict.&quot;</p> \n<p>Current U.S. sanctions include penalties for foreign companies which knowingly conducting “significant” transactions with the Revolutionary Guards, or other sanctioned Iranian entities. However, many companies in which the Revolutionary Guards have an interest in or own are not blacklisted, and have been able to sign foreign deals.</p> \n<p>Sanctions lawyers say the fine print of existing U.S. sanctions allows foreign companies to continue to deal with some IRGC-held firms indirectly.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Like other famous sexual harassers, Ari Shavit has paid a heavy price for his actions, but on social media the sentence is never completed.</p> \n<p>The furor sparked by Ari Shavit’s expressed desire to resume his career as a writer raised a number of thoughts about the punishments meted out to sexual harassers.</p> \n<p>First, let me make clear that I believe every woman who claims she was harassed. The exposure entailed in coming forward often amplifies the pain of the harassment itself many times over. So, apart from some very isolated cases, I am certain that women do not voice such complaints just out of the blue. They aren’t doing so for their own personal pleasure or for some sort of political gain, because there are other, much more pleasant ways to obtain these things. Which is why the discussion I wish to bring up here is based on the premise that a man who has been accused of sexual harassment is indeed guilty of such. Moreover, in many cases, and I believe this is so in Shavit’s case, too, there were testimonies from multiple people about such actions. And Shavit himself admitted to the actions that were attributed to him, though he maintained he did not intend to harass or hurt anyone.</p> \n<p>Of course, his claim contains some feigned innocence, in an attempt to blur the fact that his actions were violent and aggressive, and to turn them into acts of affection, love, sexual attraction and so on. Nevertheless, despite my strong feelings about sexual harassment and having been subjected to it myself – like practically all women, it seems – the shaming that is done to people, particularly to public figures, via social and other media, and not in a court of law, is a disproportionate, and therefore very cruel and almost inhuman punishment.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that as much as I am opposed to it, there is no law against petting someone’s ass, as there is against indecent exposure or, much worse, rape. Stroking someone’s ass without their consent is disgusting, but it’s not rape, and it often seems like not everyone can tell the difference: The penalty is the same – eternal condemnation – for one who petted and one who penetrated, for one who kissed and one who ejaculated.</p> \n<p>The principle of equality before the law is also violated on Facebook: A public figure like Gabi Gazit, Yinon Magal or Ari Shavit does not receive equal treatment to Joe Shmo. Why? Because if Joe Shmo is denounced on Facebook, his circles will know to be careful around him and keep potential victims away from him, while the likes of Ari Shavit, Yinon Magal and Gabi Gazit will also have their careers destroyed. They won’t be allowed to set foot in the public arena ever again, it appears.</p> \n<p>Magal was compelled to leave the Knesset and saw his media career finished due to verbal sexual harassment of his media adviser Racheli Rotner that occurred when he was drunk at a party. Gazit, according to the accusations directed at him, kissed Dana Weiss and other women on the mouth without their consent. And Shavit grabbed at journalist Daniele Berrin and tried to kiss her.</p> \n<p>Magal and Shavit apologized, left their jobs, and paid a very heavy personal and professional price. They deserve to be fully punished, but not only in the sense of being forced to pay a heavy penalty, but also in the sense that the punishment should also have an end. Shavit erred, he owned up to his error, he stayed away from the public arena for quite a long time, and now he should be able to return to it. It’s outrageous that whenever he emerges from the box prescribed for him by those who would punish him forever and ever, someone else will suddenly pop up with a recollection of having been harassed by Shavit too. There are even Jewish sources that say an evil person’s stay in hell is limited to a few months, but on Facebook, you are punished for all time.</p> \n<p>Facebook could be a fine complement or alternative to the court system, which often puts a person who has brought a complaint of rape or sexual harassment through hell. But it has no limits and therein lies its great failure. It does not reflect the law, but rather the urges of the masses, and these urges, it seems, are insatiable. If the law allows someone who has been convicted and shown remorse and served a sentence to return to being a functioning member of society, those who convict others on Facebook should also be able to show a measure of compassion toward the offenders.</p> \n<p>For now, though, the face of Israeli society, as reflected on Facebook, looks cruel and unforgiving.</p>",

Her kowtowing to her mentor, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, and blindly supporting laws that will limit democratic rule, put women back in place as second-class citizens and turning Israel into Saudi Arabia and Iran in its treatment of women and minorities is absolutely abhorrent. Does she not realize that she and her fellow ‘’witches” Culture Minister Miri Regev and Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely will no longer be able to hold their positions in the current right-wing Orthodox-dominated government, or be allowed to sit in the same chambers with their “holy” peers, or speak from the rostrum during Knesset sessions?</p> \n<p>What is happening in our country is appalling as we continue to go backward, to forgo all of the advances that have been made in our society — equal rights, equal opportunities, leadership roles for both men and women. And in most areas they are even allowed to walk on the same side of the street, dress as they wish and live as they choose.</p> \n<p>This legislation, along with the other laws the coalition is trying to ram through regarding police investigations and reports to the public and to the proper law authorities are truly an abomination. How does the thinking, caring public get its message across — demonstrations mean nothing, letters to Knesset members mean nothing — and we remain under the thumb of corrupt, self-interested government so-called leaders.</p> \n<p>Enough already.</p> \n<p>Judy Telman Mevasseret Zion</p> \n<p>Lorde did the right thing</p> \n<p>Lorde (Ella Yelich O’Connor) is an attractive, intelligent and very talented young lady who has a strong sense of what is morally right and wrong in the world today, and has shown that, on many occasions.</p> \n<p>She had two choices with her proposed concert in Israel. One, she could have boycotted the event, as per the wishes of the boycott, divest and sanctions movement. Two, she could have gone, performed and while there, used every opportunity to push the message that a negotiated, peaceful, “two-state” solution to this 70-year conflict and 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories would be in the best interests of Israelis, Palestinians and indeed, the entire world! (Everyone can see this, except for the apologists for Israel and its government.)</p> \n<p>That she heeded the call of the BDS lobby and canceled is entirely her affair and vicious attacks on her integrity are unbecoming and unnecessary. Recent spokespersons for Israel such as Juliet Moses (of the New Zealand Jewish Council) and Eli Shaul (writing in the New Zealand Herald) conveniently failed to mention the occupation of the West Bank and associated daily human rights abuses heaped on the population by the Israeli army. The house demolitions, leaving Palestinian families homeless, while more of their land is stolen for Jewish settlements, and the complete hostility to any sort of peace settlement displayed by the current (corrupt and autocratic) Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Education Minister Naftali Bennett. (Netanyahu has serious bribery and corruption charges pending.)</p> \n<p>What is at stake here is the 50-year military occupation of areas of Palestine that were not part of Israel to begin with. Any silly talk of Israel’s critics wanting to destroy Israel and “wipe it off the map” is just a red herring designed to hide the real issues and allow the Israelis and their armed forces to literally get away with murder.</p> \n<p>Until there is a binding peace settlement between the parties, so that Israelis and Palestinians can at last peacefully coexist alongside each other as neighbors rather than endlessly fighting as enemies, no artists and/or musicians should go there to perform.</p> \n<p>Haven’t we been through this movie before, with South Africa?</p> \n<p>John S.

The “struggle” is both the way and — it would appear — the goal. Perhaps along the way, the hope of peace has been obliterated and the struggle has been raised as the ultimate “cause” that Mr. Tamimi, his daughter and their family are fighting for. It would seem they have lost sight of the goal.</p> \n<p>Bakol Ruben Gellar Jerusalem</p> \n<p>Violation of Torah ethics&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In response to “Ari Shavit has been punished enough” (Alit Karp, Dec.22)</p> \n<p>Not only has Ari Shavit, a former Haaretz journalist, been punished enough, but he has also been humiliated. Shavit was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward Danielle Berrin and three other women, which certainly did not rise to the level of the criminal accusations against Harvey Weinstein and his ilk.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Berrin could have rebuked him then privately and didn’t but now again, on Dec. 22, published her accusation on the op-ed page of the widely read New York Times. She should know the Talmudic declaration that someone who shames another person, especially in public, has no share in the World to Come. As Shavit has offered an apology and she is not willing to accept it, it seems that Berrin has nursed a grudge against him for over a year. Revenge is another sin that violates Torah ethics.</p> \n<p>Compared to the recent accusations of celebrities acting repulsively against women in the American entertainment world, did Shavit’s minor misconduct warrant a lifetime ban from journalism?

They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them?&quot; [Twitter]  HOW IT PLAYED: &quot;Trump threatens aid to Palestinians, appears to contradict himself on Jerusalem&quot; by&nbsp;Jeremy Diamond:&nbsp;&quot;While Trump administration officials have said they expected a &quot;cooling off period&quot; with the Palestinians, Trump's tweets Tuesday signaled the President has grown frustrated with Palestinians' refusal to partake in a US-led peace process...&nbsp;The President's tweets... also appeared to contradict his own statements about the impact of his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and may have undermined his administration's efforts to hammer home that message in the Middle East.&quot; [CNN]&nbsp;  &quot;Palestinians condemn Trump aid halt threat, mixed reaction in Israel&quot; by&nbsp;Ali Sawafta:&nbsp;&quot;Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said in response: “We will not be blackmailed.” ...&nbsp;Commenting on Trump’s tweets, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: “Jerusalem is not for sale, neither for gold nor for silver.”&quot; [Reuters]  IPF's Michael Koplow:&nbsp;&quot;The Trump Jerusalem tweet is a great insight into his thinking... On the one hand, he confirmed the Palestinians’ biggest fear, which is that despite the careful wording of his Jerusalem statement... what Trump intended all the time was to indeed take Jerusalem off the table for them entirely... So if you are the Israelis, you should be pretty happy, right? Except that the rest of his tweet blows up any notion that he views Israel any differently than every other country on Earth... I’m pretty sure what he meant is that in return for the gift of recognizing Israeli claim to all of Jerusalem, Trump was going to extract something big from Israel in return...&nbsp;And if I am Israel, that worries me more than if Trump had come out and explicitly recognized West Jerusalem only.&quot; [Twitter]  TAKING NOTE&nbsp;-- “Nikki Haley: U.S. to Withhold Funding for UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees Until They Join Peace Process” by Noa Landau and Amir Tibon:&nbsp;“Haley said on Tuesday that Trump administration wants to stop funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency until they &quot;return to the negotiating table&quot; with Israel... &quot;He doesn't want to give any additional funding until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table, and what we saw with the resolution was not helpful to the situation,&quot; Haley said. &quot;We're trying to move for a peace process, but if that doesn't happen, the president is not going to continue to fund that situation.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  -- Flashback:&nbsp;Haley Defends UNRWA’s Schools and Healthcare Against Congressional Attacks [JewishInsider]  Former U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro tells us...&nbsp;&quot;UNRWA has also been a source of frustration because of its role in perpetuating the Palestinian refugee problem, rather than rehabilitating them. But on each occasion, the Israeli government has quietly been among the most influential advocates in getting Congress eventually to release the funds. For all the legitimate frustrations, that aid serves Israeli - and U.S. - interests, by helping maintain the stability of the Palestinian Authority and providing for the legitimate needs of Palestinian refugees. Without it, Israel's security could be harmed by the collapse of the PA, and Israel would have to take on the burdens of providing for refugees' needs that UNRWA currently does. In an honest dialogue between Israel and the Trump Administration, I would expect similar issues to be raised, and for the lion's share of that assistance to continue, while still trying to use it for leverage to get the Palestinians to negotiate and address other concerns.&quot;&nbsp;  &quot;US ambassador pays condolence visit at MK’s West Bank home&quot; by Jacob Magid:&nbsp;&quot;US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman paid a condolence visit at the home of Likud MK Yehudah Glick in the settlement of Otniel on Wednesday... Friedman was not the first American ambassador to do so. His predecessor Dan Shapiro paid condolence visits at the homes of grieving lawmakers Avigdor Liberman and Yuli Edelstein in the settlements Nokdim and Neve Daniel...&nbsp;After a reporter commented on how “unusual” it was to see an American ambassador in an Israeli settlement, Friedman said he was simply there to pay his respects. “I’d offer condolences to anyone I thought I could bring comfort to anywhere, any time, any place,” he said.&quot; [ToI]&nbsp;  HEARD YESTERDAY -- AP's Matt Lee asked&nbsp;State Department Spokeswoman&nbsp;Heather Nauert:&nbsp;&quot;Does the administration still believe that the West Bank is occupied?&quot; Nauert: &quot;I can only say that our position&nbsp;on that hasn’t changed.&quot; ML:&nbsp;&quot;Well, does that mean&nbsp;that you still regard the West Bank as being occupied?&quot; Nauert:&nbsp;&quot;I can just tell you our position hasn’t changed. I’m going to be very careful with the words because anything related to this region... is extremely sensitive. Our position has not changed, and I won’t budge from that... As you have seen, when America speaks about a matter, it is taken very seriously. And so that is why it’s important for the United States to be careful with its words.

So far, the middle class and the highly educated have been more witnesses than participants. Nonviolence is not a sacred principle. The protests first intensified in small religious towns all over the country, where the government used to take its support for granted. Metropolitan areas have so far lagged behind.&quot;  &quot;Unlike during the first decades of the post-revolutionary Iran, the rich now heedlessly flaunt their wealth. They brazenly drive Porsches and Maseratis through the streets of Tehran before the eyes of the poor and post about their wealth on Instagram. The photos travel across apps and social media and enrage the hardworking people in other cities. Iranians see pictures of the family members of the authorities drinking and hanging out on beaches around the world, while their daughters are arrested over a fallen head scarf and their sons are jailed for buying alcohol. The double standard has cultivated an enormous public humiliation.&quot;&nbsp;[NYTimes]  &quot;Iranians Are Mad as Hell About Their Foreign Policy&quot; by Dennis Ross:&nbsp;&quot;Trump has said he wants to counter Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region. At this point, however, his administration has done very little to raise the costs to the Iranians for their regional actions. In Syria, the linchpin of Iran’s effort to expand its sphere of control, the administration does not have an anti-Iran strategy. Ironically, the Iranian public is making it clear it is fed up with the costs of the country’s expansion in the region.

        "text":["<p>&quot;Everything is very complicated&quot;, an often-quoted statement by a former Austrian chancellor, was a sentiment that was, at first, ridiculed. Only later did it it became a guiding principle for understanding politics – but not only Austrian politics.</p> \n<p>That phrase couldn’t be more current. Populism is on the rise, not only in Austria but across Europe and the Western world as a whole. These increasingly successful populist movements cannot be allocated to familiar positions on the traditional scale of right and left.</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;We Austrian Jews Must Not Legitimize the Nazis in Our Government&nbsp;Opinion |&nbsp;Austria's Jewish Community Head: The Freedom Party's neo-Nazis Can't Camouflage Their Hatred of Jews by Visits to Israel&nbsp; Opinion |</p> \n<p>We see parties like Syriza in Greece, considered to be populist and leftist, but sitting in a coalition with an extreme nationalist and right-wing party. And there are both &nbsp;commonalities and differences between the populist far-right parties of France’s Le Pen, German’s AfD and the Austrian Freedom Party (FP&Ouml;).</p> \n<p>For now, many commentators describe the new Austrian government as representing a strong shift to the right. But at the same time the program of this very same government includes positive statements regarding Israel, the Holocaust and anti-Semitism that have never been heard from any previous center-left Austrian government. That program includes a clear &quot;commitment to Israel as a Jewish state&quot;&nbsp;and is supporting any peace settlement &quot;with particular attention to Israel’s security interests&quot;&nbsp;(my emphasis).</p> \n<p>Even more astounding for a so-called right-wing government, that platform includes this acknowledgement: &quot;Austria is committed to recognizing its complicity and responsibility towards one of the greatest tragedies in world history. Above all, we want to commemorate those who underwent as a result, terrible suffering and misery, and set a clear signal against any form of anti-Semitism.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Karin Kneissl, the new Austrian foreign minister, has been awarded some attention from Israel and Jewish groups. She has compared Zionism to the &quot;blood and soil&quot; ideology of German nationalism. Kneissl has an interesting life story: She grew up partly in Jordan, lived in several Arab countries, but also in Israel, and is fluent in both Arabic and Hebrew. She has been always very undiplomatically outspoken in all directions. Criticizing Islam, the developments in the Arab world, but also the pope or German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p> \n<p>Nowadays, there are no neo-Nazis in Austria shouting, &quot;Death to the Jews&quot; but rather Muslims protesting against President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, in front of the U.S. embassy lin Vienna last week. And it's no longer a cogent argument to claim that, if for now the rightists have turned on the Muslims, they will eventually turn on the Jews again, in time.</p> \n<p>Anti-Semitism has ceased to be a political weapon in Austria and Sebastian Kurz, the new Austrian chancellor has repeatedly stressed the Judeo-Christian roots and values of Austrian society throughout his election campaign.</p> \n<p>Of course, Sebastian Kurz’s coalition partner, the Freedom Party (FP&Ouml;) has its history. The Austrian Freedom Party (FP&Ouml;) indeed established itself as a homestead for former Nazis. Dealing with war criminals and former members of the Nazi party (NSDAP) was part of the political reality of post-war Austria.</p> \n<p>But it should be remembered that both social democrats and conservatives have openly courted their support. In the 1970s Bruno Kreisky, the famous, notorious social democratic Austrian chancellor, turned the FP&Ouml; into a political partner. In 2000 it was the conservative party which entered a coalition with the black sheep of Austrian politics. By that time the FP&Ouml; had already turned into an anti-immigration and populist movement.</p> \n<p>It is time to face the new realities throughout Europe: The growing number of Muslims, living mainly in the Western European cities, often living in effectively parallel societies, putting Muslim Sharia law above the law of the land, and who exhibit a high level of anti-Semitism, are a big challenge.</p> \n<p>But the new Austrian government has to solve many more issues: Taxes are far too high in Austria, our bureaucracy, laws and regulations are increasingly blocking economic growth, we need to reform the social security system, education and many other areas. That's a full schedule for the new government under the leadership of the youngest ever Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Martin Engelberg was born in Vienna and is an active member of Austria’s Jewish community. A psychoanalyst and leadership consultant, he is a member of the Austrian parliament for Sebastian Kurz's People's Party (OVP), one of the very few openly Jewish candidates for parliament since 1945.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Just like at Jerry Seinfeld’s Tel Aviv concert two years ago, this time too I wondered whether the hugely appreciative audience really understood what the U.S. comedian was throwing at them.</p> \n<p>Seinfeld’s act is one of spectacular misanthropy. Right off the bat, he declares that all people’s lives are meaningless, that life in general sucks, that it’s too long, a huge waste of time, a foolish way to pass the days until death arrives, and that boredom is a basic existential condition.</p> \n<p>The concert itself was described as simply a meeting of people who felt they had to be there because they felt bad in the place where they were before, and that in no time they’d be feeling bad where they were now. For Seinfeld, people are slaves to the absurdity that they themselves create. This message is conveyed clearly and powerfully.</p> \n<p>Still, many of the levels of Seinfeld’s humor are implied. He won’t actually say the F-word, but that’s where his basic worldview is at. The sated Westerner, the butt of Seinfeld’s jokes, is a pathetic creature who can barely get himself out of his house, and the height of his ambition is to eat at some restaurant everyone’s calling the hottest in town.</p> \n<p>Seinfeld doesn’t want to eat at that restaurant. He doesn’t want to hear the waiter tell him what the specials are. All that hype is a sign of idiocy. He defines contemporary man as a means of carrying a cellphone from place to place. The cellphone’s mobility is the goal and the person is merely serving it. That’s what a person is worth to Seinfeld.</p> \n<p>In every corner of popular culture, people are looking for comfort, kindness, praise, empowerment and a positive attitude. It’s what they’re looking for on Facebook and TV shows, in books and films. The world of stand-up comedy is refreshing because a work of art can be presented here that’s not a pacifier. And yet it’s amazing to see how, for the past few decades, a global audience of millions has enjoyed Seinfeld’s sophisticated misanthropy.</p> \n<p>In Tel Aviv, he didn’t give anybody a break either. His view of humanity is cold and cruel, merciless. Human beings are ridiculous, and the most important thing is developing techniques to cut them off in the middle of whatever they’re saying and to escape without hurting their feelings. Because they get excited; they get excited about nonsense, about a new restaurant, a special dish. And Seinfeld curbs their enthusiasm. He rises above their stupidity.</p> \n<p>Seinfeld’s views on marriage are also devoid of compassion. His warm-up act, Mark Schiff, told a lot of jokes about married life. Both comics presented exactly the same picture of domesticity: The man as dishrag; a doormat stomped on by a critical, judgmental, controlling woman who sets the rules at home. But for Schiff, this is a warm, familiar, stereotypical picture – a well-worn clich&eacute; that has become a social ritual. He makes clear that he loves his wife.</p> \n<p>Seinfeld, however, is cold. His pictures of married life show the man as the object of unending humiliation – not only by his wife, but also by his children. They hardly notice he’s alive. And they don’t need him.</p> \n<p>Seinfeld compares the husband to a balloon that’s lost its helium and drifts aimlessly, unwanted, around the house, sinking downward, tied to a slack string, representing his flaccid phallus and lack of manhood. From the moment of their birth, the purpose of children is to take his place.</p> \n<p>For Seinfeld, the human condition is similar to that presented by the late Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin.</p> \n<p>Like all the great comedians, Seinfeld isn’t actually funny. He has a phenomenal talent to make people feel like he’s joking about the trivialities of life, the small moments, about nothing. When in fact what he’s really telling them is that everything is nothing. Under the thin veneer of Seinfeldian humor lies an abyss of serious depression.</p>",

Hourly wages for those graduates placed in internship positions is $28 — 30% above the median hourly wage.</p> \n<p>Zero to employable</p> \n<p>“When you look at our data, there’s no significant gap between graduates who had already earned a degree in some other field and those who only took our course,” says Enbar. “Of course, we also have a selection bias [participants do not represent the general population because applicants are screened]. But what can be said with certainty is that it’s possible to bring every student from zero to employable if a suitable program is designed for him. We’ve done programs with New York City for refugees who had no education and the investment was much greater, but they achieved the same results at the end of the course.”</p> \n<p>Enbar was in Israel as a guest of the Israel Innovation Authority, which announced in July that it would support organizations that would offer quick training programs in the form of coding boot camps, and it wanted to learn from Flatiron’s experience. The authority is seeking a rapid response to the needs of an industry that’s suffering a personnel shortage and believes the most suitable population for retraining is college graduates in science with a math background who aren’t working in high-tech.</p> \n<p>In 2018 the authority plans to subsidize training for 250 people through organizations that win a bidding process, and to increase that to 500 people annually in subsequent years.</p> \n<p>Flatiron is one of the pioneers in coding boot camps, which have developed into a flourishing industry in the United States that has generated $266 million in revenue and trained some 15,000 coders.</p> \n<p>Not all coding schools succeed; in fact the largest of them, those affiliated with such educational companies like Kaplan or schools like the University of Phoenix have closed. Last year a school called Coding House in Silicon Valley was closed by California regulators after it was revealed that it fabricated its job placement statistics.</p> \n<p>The schools that survive tend to be the smaller ones that can adjust their curricula more quickly to meet the industry’s changing needs, which is exactly what universities have difficulty doing.</p> \n<p>“The iPhone is 10 years old, and there’s a multibillion-dollar app industry built on it,” explains Enbar. “Even if the universities had begun teaching app development the day the iPhone came out, at best they would have started producing graduates only five or six years ago. The entire mobile economy was created by people that never learned these things in university.”</p> \n<p>Do you envision a time when a Harvard degree stops being relevant to employers?</p> \n<p>“I go to lots of conferences and meet politicians and educators, and whenever I speak about revolutions in education the first thing people think about are Stanford and Harvard, and they say ‘They’ll be here a long time, even if they don’t change any of their methods,’” says Enbar. “But the truth is that it doesn’t matter, because we’re talking about 1% of the population.</p> \n<p>“In Israel you have [Military Intelligence Unit] 8200, people who were smart in high school and got into a unit that sets them up for life. But if we want to improve education in Israel, do we start thinking about the problems in the way things are taught in 8200? Who cares? The real problem is those people who went into debt to get a higher education and can’t get out of it, or people who weren’t in 8200 and for whom we haven’t developed a different system to help them get ahead. They’re the 99%.”</p> \n<p>Intensive training</p> \n<p>That’s funny, because 8200 is apparently the best proof that this model of intensive training really works.</p> \n<p>“I’ve heard that. The question is whether the 8200 model is actually based on the ability to choose superior people at age 17, who would have succeeded in any case. I can’t say. But I think there’s a huge misunderstanding about what technology is, and people think you have to be born at Matrix to write code.</p> \n<p>What do you mean?</p> \n<p>“In reality there is a wide spectrum, and because this field emerged so fast we are still calling it ‘computer science.’ But once we called all sciences ‘earth sciences’ and didn’t distinguish between biology and physics, or between organic and molecular chemistry. It took years of sophistication to reach that. Today’s job market has a wide spectrum — there’s someone who writes Google’s search engine, for which you presumably need a doctorate in math; and there’s someone else writing email templates, for which you need two weeks of training. And then there are all the hundreds of things in between.”</p> \n<p>Such as?</p> \n<p>“Look at the startups with the highest values in the world — Airbnb, Uber, WeWork — most of these companies and most startups do not invent technology. The innovation isn’t technical. ... Most of the value created today is not from inventing technology, but from creating new business models using existing technology. For this what’s really needed is to be creative and empathetic; to understand people and put yourself in their shoes so you can understand their problems. This is exactly the opposite of what people perceive as the spectrum of ‘technical ability’ and what people traditionally think makes a good engineer.”</p> \n<p>How do you get employers to believe that?</p> \n<p>“When we started Flatiron five years ago there was no such model, and people thought we were crazy. So from the start we said that we weren’t going to fight with the people who think you need a computer science degree from a prestigious university. There are enough people out there who believe there’s another way to learn, or who are at least open enough to say, ‘We’re having trouble recruiting so let’s give this a chance, we’ll interview someone or give him an internship and see what happens.’</p> \n<p>“The graduates of our first class found work, and the graduates of our second and third classes found work in better places. Today you can’t think of a company where our graduates haven’t been placed — from Google through Facebook to NASA.</p> \n<p>“So all these companies are prepared to employ our graduates and there are still people who will insist on screening out those without a four-year degree? It’s hard to even respond to that. Such a company is simply putting itself at a competitive disadvantage because the bottom line is that I’m bringing them someone who can get the work done.”</p> \n<p>Who cares about Google</p> \n<p>Flatiron is a relatively a strange bird among programming schools. It raised $15 million, but unlike other schools, it avoided expansion and rapid opening of branches. The capital was invested in developing a technology that makes Flatiron courses available to other students, free and paid. The first results of the platform are encouraging.</p> \n<p>Enbar's visit to Israel was also linked to recent news – the school was acquired by the cowork office spaces company WeWork, founded by Israeli Adam Neumann, whose current value is estimated at $ 20 billion. The purchase amount was not published.</p> \n<p>Enbar is the first generation who completed a higher education in his family. His father grew up in Israel and immigrated to the United States after his military service, where he met his mother, who spent her childhood in Paris and Canada. During his childhood and adolescence, before he came to New York, Enbar lived in three different places - Miami, Canada, and a certain period in Israel (aged 10-13). &quot;My parents always thought that education was important, and wherever we went, they chose the residential area according to the quality of the nearest school. They believed in the American dream - go to university, learn what you love no matter how much it costs. When I started college, I did not think about what I would learn and how it would affect me.”</p> \n<p>&quot;I studied for a bachelor's degree in public policy at Cornell and after working in many jobs unrelated to my education, I went to do an MBA at Harvard, but I did not acquire any hard skills&quot;, he said. &quot;I couldn’t enter a workplace and say: 'Here's what I can do for you.'</p> \n<p>I was always interested and involved in Education, during my B.A I taught first graders for six months, and during my MBA at Harvard, I taught entrepreneurship to prisoners.&quot;</p> \n<p>Flatiron reports on the placement of its graduates every year, but does not keep track of the age of the students. According to Enbar, the age range is broad: from 18 to 50 years.</p> \n<p>How likely is it for a 40-year-old to start learning programming and get accepted to Google?</p> \n<p>&quot;When people talk about high-tech jobs, they immediately think about Facebook and Google; And I don’t say that ageism doesn’t exist, there is definitely a problem in the tech industry that it has to deal with. But it's a big mistake to look at this training through the question of whether they will succeed at Google. Have all Harvard or 8200 alumni go to google – who cares? It’s not Google that lacks programming skills, but the thousands of companies that cannot advance without technology. The New York Times pays programmers more than start-ups, and developers are also needed at banks, fashion chains and supermarkets- &nbsp;so as long as 40 year olds keep themselves relevant they will have a job.&quot;</p> \n<p>The higher education system is not designed for career changes.</p> \n<p>“That’s true. Our whole system is designed for one time learning and a lifelong career. Our education system is actually designed to make factory workers - sit and stand when the bell rings, 15 minutes pause, pay attention, raise your hand when you want to speak. If you were going to invent education from scratch, there are many things you might imagine, but the idea of sending someone to a campus for four years and then say 'OK, now you're done learning, go to work' is crazy, it makes no sense.&quot;</p> \n<p>What about online course platforms like Coursera? They don’t change the face of education?</p> \n<p>&quot;No, when it comes to online education we are failing. We’ve taken the worst part of education, the lecture, and said, 'Let's put it on the Internet and call it technology.'&quot; This is so stupid, because it's a model that assumes that the value of education is in communicating information to students. If that were the case, libraries would have put universities out of business, and it makes me laugh because we repeat these mistakes over and over again. When the radio arrived they also played lectures.”</p> \n<p>Why do we fail?</p> \n<p>&quot;Because education is not about connecting students with information, it’s about connecting students with each other through information - putting people in one place and giving them a subject to talk about - that's real learning and no one is doing it. It's amazing because it should be obvious-every meaningful technological company - in its core - connects people. Airbnb, Uber, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn. But in the end you come to Coursera and there may be 1,000 people from Tel Aviv who are taking the same online course on the site, but they cannot find each other.&quot;</p> \n<p>And how are Flatiron's online lessons any different?</p> \n<p>&quot;The reason we succeed is not because we have better lecturers or better content or that we are closer to the market - that can be easily copied. It’s because when you enter our platform you do not see a video that speaks to you, but other students- &nbsp;you feel like you are part of a community.&quot;</p> \n<p>Well, I see you've already adopted the WeWork slogans.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our connection with WeWork is exactly the future of education- we have students in Miami who meet up to study in a supermarket because they found each other through our platform and that's where they have a conditioning and a free wifi connection. Now they'll go to WeWork, and learn among the industry because WeWork is the place for start-ups and entrepreneurs – can you imagine any better way to learn?”</p> \n<p>You told me you don’t want to be Harvard or 8200, but in fact you created a very selective alternative path, that receives only 10% of the candidates, for a tuition fee of $15,000.</p> \n<p>&quot;Our acceptance was limited mainly because of physical limitations – up to 20 students a course - which we hope to solve now with the partnership with WeWork. As for the price, I'm pretty sure we could charge more - the return on investment is amazing relative to other options. By the way, in my first conversation with Adam Neumann after the acquisition, when I presented forecasts and talked about the possibility of raising the price, his reaction was 'Are you mad? We will lower prices and give the opportunity to more people.'&quot;</p> \n<p>What would you recommend to people thinking of taking an accelerated training program like Flatiron’s?</p> \n<p>&quot;That you have to come for the right reasons. There are people who hate their job, and I tell them that that's a great reason to leave that job, but not necessarily a good reason to do this program. The beauty of programming is that you can try it for free - unlike law, accounting or medicine. You can take a free online course, go to a meetup at WeWork, or work on a project. Make sure you love it before you commit to it.&quot;</p> \n<p>Will Flatiron open in Israel?</p> \n<p>&quot;I hope so! We are opening in several new places this year, mainly in the United States, but WeWork likes to do things first in Israel, so we are actively looking into it.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The conductor of the Missed Opportunities Orchestra gave the signal, and a crescendo of declarations sounded over the country following Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The most popular one echoed Abba Eban’s saying, “The Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.” The barrage began with TV commentator Roni Daniel, continued with Shlomo Avineri, and then Eli Podeh chose to put the cart before the horse by recalling the lost opportunity of the 1947 UN Partition Plan. Not only the Israelis – the White House also did its share by blaming the Palestinians for “walking away again from an opportunity to discuss the future of the region.”</p> \n<p>Looking at the linguistics of this information campaign, the word “opportunity” implies that glad tidings are at hand. The Palestinians have been awash in such tidings since 1917. That year the racist and anti-Semite Lord Balfour delivered the encouraging news that their homeland was the home of the Jews, who made up less than 10 percent of its population. In 1947 came yet more happy surprises. Researcher Elad Ben-Dror (“Why the Swede behind UN partition favored the Jews,” November 24) discovered that Paul Mohn, a pro-Zionist Swede, was the man who drew the UN partition map. He gave the Palestinians, who by then made up two-thirds of the population, an amazing offer – 38 percent of Palestine. The Jews got 62 percent. The UN sweetened the deal a bit, but the fundamental injustice remained. Mohn, like Balfour, was a dyed-in-the-wool racist. He set aside the Negev for the Jews because the Bedouins, in his view, had lived there “without leaving a trace.” On that reasoning, the white man can expel the people of Africa who do not leave a trace.</p> \n<p>Around here, these plagues are called opportunities for some reason. Soon the Palestinians in the West Bank’s Area C will receive letters saying to the effect: A rare opportunity awaits – they’re demolishing your home. Don’t miss this opportunity – they’re expropriating your land. Exciting opportunity – they’re deporting you from your homeland.</p> \n<p>And if the Palestinians had greeted the tidings of partition with joy, would the Zionist leadership have let them stay on their land? Ask the residents of Deir Yassin, who agreed to have good neighborly relations with their Jewish neighbors, and one spring day Jewish death squads came and killed their children and destroyed their homes. And not only Deir Yassin. Dozens of peace-seeking villages tasted the treachery of the Zionist leadership. Still, we are moved to recall that there were those who cried over the bitter fate of the uprooted as they went about taking over their land.</p> \n<p>Hypocrites, when they don’t wish to confront this painful truth, blame the victims and thus quiet their consciences. The truth is that the dominant stream of the Zionist movement crushed and continues to crush Palestinian nationalism. That’s how it was in 1917, 1948 and 1967. The intellectual property owner of this terminology is Haaretz editor-in-chief Aluf Benn, who wrote an op-ed (“Crushing Palestinian nationalism,” December 8) the day after Trump’s Jerusalem declaration. Benn wrote that Benjamin Netanyahu “sees the relationship between the two national movements as a zero-sum game.” That’s the whole story. Whatever the Palestinians do or don’t do, nothing will change. Indeed, the Arab peace initiative has been sitting here like a rock that one dares not turn over; Israel won’t even discuss it.</p> \n<p>It is important to criticize the Palestinian leadership for its insularity and inability to put forward a democratic discourse that takes into account the wishes of the many Jews who want to live together with the Arabs. However, the Palestinians’ biggest mistake was that when they understood the goal of the Zionist movement to take over the country and expel the Arabs, they didn’t understand the enormous power of the Zionist movement to achieve that goal.</p> \n<p>Even if the Palestinians had acted in the most sophisticated way, they could not have turned back the tsunami foretold in the chilling slogan “a land without a people for a people without a land.” No matter what they would have done, the tsunami would have struck. It isn’t for nothing that Arabs refer to the events of 1948 as the Nakba, a term ordinarily taken from the realm of natural disasters.</p>",

        "text":["<p>About 8,000 years ago, as the Near Eastern climate warmed and rain increased after the Ice Age, somebody in the Neolithic Georgia hills was making the earliest-known wine in Europe and possibly the world, say scientists, based on analysis of residue in newly discovered pottery jars.</p> \n<p>The prehistoric Caucasus villagers didn’t mix, mull or monkey with their wine, it seems, but drank it straight, as we do today, say the archaeologists in their paper, “Archaeologists find earliest evidence of winemaking.”</p> \n<p>In fact, the prehistoric Chinese were also fermenting an alcoholic beverage involving the grape a thousand years earlier, says Prof. Davide Tanasi, an archaeologist from the University of South Florida who wasn’t involved in the Caucasus study. But the Georgian tipple represents the oldest pure grape wine known so far in Europe, as it is dated to 6000-5800 B.C.E., explains Prof. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of the study.</p> \n<p>Dating to around 9,000 years ago, the Chinese drink is the oldest alcoholic beverage known so far, but it wasn't a wine per se. It was a sort of Neolithic cocktail.</p> \n<p>The Neolithic Caucasian wine on the other hand was clearly a real wine – that is, fermented grape juice – biomolecular archaeologist McGovern told Haaretz. However, it apparently lacked the tree resin that would be widely used as a preservative by later winemakers in the region.</p> \n<p>“We don’t know why this very early wine lacked a tree resin, especially since the discovery of its antioxidant properties for keeping wine was probably discovered very early,” McGovern says.&nbsp;“For example, grape vines grow up trees, and in the process of making wine from wild grapes, some tree resin might well have been mixed with the wine and its preservative properties empirically observed.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So when did early vintners discover the properties of tree sap? “The oldest example of resin added to grape wine is dated to 5400 to 5000 B.C.E. and it was identified in a sample from a container found in the Neolithic settlement of Hajji Firuz Tepe in Iran’s northern Zagros Mountains,” Tanasi told Haaretz.</p> \n<p>As the weather warmed, the people in the south Caucasus who made this wine, and the jars housing it, had already transited from a hunting-gathering lifestyle to living year-round in settlements. They were farming, growing barley, wheat and chickpeas, and seem to have been indulging in the grape, which, the archaeologists have demonstrated, was growing all over the place.</p> \n<p>Can’t stand it</p> \n<p>The Georgian wine jars (known as qvevri) are the earliest examples of pottery found in the Near East, where pottery-making seems to have begun to develop around 9,000 years ago, say the researchers.</p> \n<p>Even so, the prehistoric Caucasians in Khramis Didi Gora and the environs do not seem to have invented ceramics. People may have been shaping and firing clay tens of thousands of years ago. There are, albeit controversial, discoveries of early ceramics, including figurines found in the Czech Republic that date back over 30,000 years, Chinese ceramics that some date to around 18,000 years ago, or pottery in Jomon sites in Japan which some believe date to over 10,000 years ago, and so on.</p> \n<p>Possibly, pottery-making developed relatively late in the Caucasus region – or they had been making pottery for a long time but we haven’t found it. “Thus far and surprisingly, the Near East has not yielded any pottery, even sporadically like the Czech finding, earlier than the early 7th millennium B.C.E.,” McGovern says.</p> \n<p>The Georgian pots seem to have been fired on open flames, not inside closed kilns. (Pottery fired low on open fires is more friable than kiln-baked pottery fired at high temperatures.)</p> \n<p>In any case, based on the sheer dimensions of the Georgian jars – which could be a meter tall – they probably served as combination fermentation, aging, and serving vessels, suggest the scientists. One, for example, had a capacity of more than 300 liters (nearly 80 gallons); the prehistoric Georgians would hardly have troubled to pour the contents of one giant jar into another just for kicks.</p> \n<p>Not unlike clay jars in the Middle East with their weirdly conical bases, these Georgian vessels had unsteady bases, such as flattened or low disks or low pedestals, which “seem inadequate to independently support a vessel full of liquid,” as McGovern and co-author Prof. David Lordkipanidze, general director of the Georgian National Museum, put it.</p> \n<p>Indeed. Since they could not stand, maybe these jars were fixed, buried in the ground, with exposed shoulders and mouths. Or perhaps the bases were supposed to be decorative in some fashion, like their upper parts, which did bear crude embellishment.</p> \n<p>“Large jars similar to the Neolithic vessels, still used to make wine in Georgia today, are a strong indication that the region’s wine culture has deep historical roots and strong continuity,” Lordkipanidze told Haaretz. “We started to make wine in ancient times and we continue to do so.”</p> \n<p>Gobekli Tepe: First in fermentation, too?</p> \n<p>Whether the ancient Georgians invented wine, let alone pottery, is debatable. It is true that the earliest-known winemaking in Italy, for example, dates back “just” 6,000 years, according to the University of South Florida, but the Chinese may have significantly predated that, producing honey-wine about 9,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>“The combination honey, hawthorn tree fruit and grape wine from Jiahu in the Yellow River Valley is the earliest chemically confirmed ‘wine’ in the world thus far,” McGovern told Haaretz. “But the [Chinese] grape was derived from a different species from the Eurasian grape (Vitis vinifera).&nbsp;Although China has many species (up to 40), some of which are quite sweet in the wild and suitable for wine, none were ever domesticated so far as is known.&nbsp;Moreover, unlike the Georgian grape wine, the Chinese combined several ingredients, including rice beer, into a mixed or extreme fermented beverage.”</p> \n<p>Biomolecular analysis of the pottery found chemical evidence of tartaric, malic, succinic and citric acids, all biomarkers of the Eurasian grape – Vitis vinifera.</p> \n<p>This Eurasian grape accounts for 99.9 percent of the world’s wine today: it was domesticated and made into wine only in the ancient Near East, says McGovern. Tastes may not have changed much: From the earliest stage of viniculture, about 8,000 years ago, the Neolithics were making unmixed wine, like we are accustomed to today, he says.</p> \n<p>It is also possible that the grape was first domesticated in eastern Turkey or elsewhere in the Near East, which includes northern Israel – where humans coming out of Africa would have first seen the wild Eurasian grape, says McGovern.</p> \n<p>And it is possible that the ancients were making wine well before they invented the convenience of pottery jars.</p> \n<p>Would Neolithic wine have been very different from today’s? “It’s a fact that in antiquity wine was usually mixed with resins or fruit juice to alter the taste, or mixed with water in order to slow down effects of drunkenness,” Tanasi tells Haaretz. “So from this standpoint, our wine can be somehow different.”</p> \n<p>However, as each ancient civilization had different drinking practices, one cannot generalize more, he adds.</p> \n<p>Could the area also have birthed the first beer? Tanasi points out the earliest-known beer has been identified in the site of Godin Tepe in Lower Mesopotamia, dated to the end of the 4th millennium B.C.E.</p> \n<p>McGovern and Lordkipanidze point out that three basic crops – einkorn wheat, chickpea and bitter vetch (a rather revolting pea) – seem to have been domesticated in southeastern Anatolia, Turkey, which is home to the extraordinary prehistoric sites of Gobekli Tepe and Nevali ori. Some speculate that the monumental figurative carvings on the Gobekli hilltop are the world’s earliest temple. It has been mooted that at these spots, wheat may have been fermented into beer in limestone vats, and drunk out of stone cups, write McGovern and Lordkipanidze.</p> \n<p>Maybe these sites on the windswept hills going back some 11,000 to 12,000 years, to the dawn of human settlement, will eventually prove to be the mother of wine as well.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The cherry tomato is not an Israeli invention, and this isn’t the first time the fact has been stated loud and clear. But because the claim is so widely accepted, let me repeat once again: It’s false. The truth is that Israeli researchers developed modern varieties of the cherry tomato, which has become a commercial product found all over the world, mainly thanks to its long shelf life. Until the 1980s miniature tomatoes were a marginal crop used in dishes mainly as decoration.</p> \n<p>To learn more about the origin of the cherry tomato and why it continues to appear on popular lists of original Israeli inventions, a good start is an article by Anna Wexler, which was published in the summer issue of the American quarterly Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies. Wexler investigates the origin of the cherry tomato (apparently Central America), offers evidence of its presence in Western culture starting in the 17th century, and tries to explain why it has become part of an attempt to shape Israeli national identity, as well as an instrument of the country’s public relations.</p> \n<p>According to Wexler, the almost blind belief in the cherry tomato as an original Israeli development is attractive to Israelis because it goes along with their self-image as innovators. “For example, Israelis often point to the fact that prior to 1948, Israel was a malaria-infested swampland, but in just 60 years – due to Israeli ingenuity – the country became a center of scientific and technological development,” she writes.</p> \n<p>I recalled Wexler’s excellent article two weeks ago, when the cherry tomato was mentioned as proof of Israeli creativity and innovation at an academic conference devoted to Israeli cuisine sponsored by American University in Washington, D.C. The conference, “Israeli Cuisine as a Reflection of Israeli Society,” was initiated by the Center for Israel Studies at American University. This writer was invited to take part in a panel dealing with the politics of food and the Jewish-Arab conflict. The lectures and discussions, open to the general public, attracted large audiences.</p> \n<p>“It’s not to be taken for granted that such a group of chefs, sociologists, anthropologists and other food scholars from Israel and worldwide, is convening here in order to talk about Israeli food,” said Dr. Yahil Zaban of Tel Aviv University, one of the speakers.</p> \n<p>“Israeli cuisine is today seen as an exceptionally complex cultural phenomenon, in both its academic and culinary aspects. There’s no question that this is a subject that fascinates not only foodies but researchers of food and culture from all over the world as well.”</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing that the organizers were able to convene almost all the academics who have written important studies on the subject of Israeli cuisine in recent years. We tried to do it in Israel and were unsuccessful,” says Prof. Nir Avieli of Ben Gurion University of the Negev, another speaker and a pioneer of academic writing about food in Israel.</p> \n<p>He says that a local cuisine is almost always defined from the viewpoint of an outsider. “When I did my doctorate on field work in Vietnam, one of my interviewees made an unforgettable statement: ‘Food becomes local only when foreigners arrive.’ Until then it is simply food that is consumed on a daily basis.” In today’s Israel, where the restaurant scene is collapsing and many restaurateurs and chefs are trying to start careers abroad, this statement is even more pertinent.</p> \n<p>Soft diplomacy</p> \n<p>The Israeli chefs invited to speak at the conference – including Michael Solomonov (Zahav restaurant in Philadelphia and Dizengoff in New York) and Einat Admony (Taim and Balaboosta in New York), along with Tom Franz, winner of the “MasterChef” cooking TV program, work mainly outside the country. “Most of them haven’t operated a restaurant in Israel or passed the test of the Israeli public,” says Avieli.</p> \n<p>The chefs were generous with compliments for Israeli produce (which, however, has become industrial in recent years, enslaved to draconian government regulation and exposed to massive imports from abroad). They played on the sense of identification of the audience, many of whom had some connection to Israel, and often did not stick to the facts (for example, on the invention of the cherry tomato, and used cliches about the melting pot and Israeli integration). Food scholar Mitchell Davis, the moderator of the judges’ panel, tried to get a clear answer from them to the simple question: “What exactly is Israeli cuisine?” but it’s not certain he succeeded.</p> \n<p>“Most of the chefs who attended the conference are chefs who market ‘Israeli cuisine’ abroad, whether in the United States or in Europe,” says Dr. Rafi Grosglik, who received his degree from Ben Gurion University and now teaches at the University of California, Davis. “For political or commercial reasons they create a connection between foods, food products and culinary images on the one hand, and presentations of nationalism on the other. They use food as a type of soft diplomacy, to create a partial, positive picture of Israel, which is sometimes far from the reality. That happens all over the world, of course, not only in Israel, and it illustrates the way in which chefs have become important agents of culture, and not exclusively in the culinary sphere.”</p> \n<p>The speakers from the academic world presented a more critical discourse than did the chefs. Dr. Ronald Ranta of Kingston University in London, who specializes in issues of cuisine and nationalism, delivered a fascinating speech about the constant duality in Israel’s attitude toward Palestinian cuisine, which involves denial, admiration and appropriation at one at the same time. Prof. Avieli presented a study proving that the foods most widely consumed in Israel are actually pasta and pizza – contrary to the popular conception that falafel and hummus are the favorites – and spoke of a desire to aspire to the Mediterranean ideal rather than Mediterraneanreality.</p> \n<p>Love and hate</p> \n<p>Foodie and artist Dr. Yael Raviv, author of “Falafel Nation,” demonstrated the way attitudes toward food are reflected in contemporary Israeli art; and Zaban made the audience laugh when he talked about the demand by Israeli chefs – including Pini Levy, Hussam Abbas, Eyal Shani, Ezra Kedem and Erez Komarovsky – to receive credit for inventing an eggplant dish with tahini (baladi eggplant carpaccio). In fact, this is actually baba ganoush, an ancient Mediterranean dish that was prepared and consumed by Muslims, Jews and Christians. In various versions, it is popular to this day all over the Levant.</p> \n<p>“It’s no wonder that all the Israeli chefs who demand credit for inventing baladi eggplant carpaccio attribute it to the 1990s, right after the Oslo Accords,” says Zaban. “During those years Israeli cuisine developed a new identity, which corresponds with the Palestinian tradition and Mediterranean cooking. To this day Israeli cooking has a love-hate relationship with these traditions.</p> \n<p>“Think how difficult it would be for an Israeli chef to say ‘Palestinian cooking’ or ‘Arab cooking,’ and how easy it is for him to say ‘Shami,’ ‘Galilean,’ ‘Jerusalemite.’ That may also be the reason why this conference could take place in the United States, and not in Israel. In Israeli discourse, diners flee from reality to food, which becomes a reflection of the fears and anxieties from which they’re fleeing. In today’s political atmosphere, the dark sides of ‘Israeli taste’ are downplayed: the economic, ethnic and national oppression that are hidden in a pita. That’s also the main reason why Israeli cuisine is so successful in the United States and Europe – it is able to provide a softened, ‘civilized’ and non-threatening experience of the Middle East,” Zaban concludes.</p>",

        "text":["<p>President Reuven Rivlin commented about relations between Israel and American Jews on Thursday, following Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely's disparaging words about the latter. In his speech, Rivlin said that tensions between Israel and U.S. Jewry are high and that a new alliance between the two sides was in order.</p> \n<p>Hotovely attacked U.S. Jews in an interview with i24 News on Wednesday, blaming the growing rift between the American Jewish community and Israel on the former's &quot;convenient lives,&quot; and criticized them for not serving their country in the military. She also said that American Jews were using the Western Wall crisis for political gain.</p> \n<p>Rivlin discussed the agreement decided on by David Ben Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, and American Jewish leader Jacob Blaustein, which emphasized that American Jews were primarily U.S. citizens whose loyalty lay with that country, and that Israel represented only its own citizens. Furthermore, Israel did not expect American Jews to immigrate and neither side would interfere in political decisions taken by the other.</p> \n<p>For almost seventy years, this agreement formed the basis for understandings between Israel and Diaspora Jews, serving as a bridge upon which strong and lasting relations between Israel and the largest Jewish community were built, said Rivlin. He noted that he had just returned from a visit to the U.S., where he witnessed the great love American Jews have for Israel, and said that this agreement may need to be reexamined.</p> \n<p>“I also saw great concern and pain over the weakening of the bridges connecting them to Israel,&quot; he said. &quot;I clarified to them that they have to respect Israel’s democracy and its people’s word. To us, I say that this is a moment of reckoning for both communities. American Jews are less traditional than they used to be but still very involved, with a very strong independent identity. Due to changes that have taken place, it is time to renew the alliance and find a common language before it’s too late.” He added that American Jews yearn for ties with Israel, but as equals, not basing their relationship on philanthropy on one hand or on blind admiration on the other.</p> \n<p>Israeli society, he said, is also in a different place vis-&agrave;-vis American Jews than in past years – Israel is prosperous, has a strong economy and serves as a model of initiative and technological innovation. “Therefore, we must set out on a new path,&quot; he said. &quot;No more relations based on charity, but a joint commitment to justice, mutual Jewish and human responsibility. No more silencing of mutual criticism, but courageous openness and honesty. No more idealization, but sincere partnership based on true familiarity with each other and on agreed-upon institutions for resolving problems, aimed at setting joint policies. This is how we’ll honor the memory of Ben-Gurion and his generation and justify his legacy.”</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Hotovely's comments, saying that &quot;Diaspora Jews are dear to us and an inseparable part of our people.&quot; Israeli religious and political figures with close ties to the progressive Jewish community called for her to be fired for her remarks.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the yard of the Oz family in the Galilee community of Atzmon, amid the fruit trees (figs, almonds, feijoas, lemons, pomegranates, clementines, olives) and the dense herb garden (aloe vera, sage, rosemary, lemon verbena), lies a bare, fenced-off patch of ground. This dead area was not neglected deliberately. It was dug up by wild boars that roam the village at night looking for wet roots to suck on, in the wake of long years of drought. To protect themselves against the boars, the majority of Atzmon’s residents put up high fences, in some cases electrified.</p> \n<p>Israel Oz, formerly an organizational consultant, now a writer and board director for various pension funds, differs from his neighbors in his views of how to deal with the boars. His approach is guided by his objection in principle to being entrenched behind walls; that, he says, is one of the ills of the “chosen communities,” as he calls them, the villages that are scattered across the Misgav Regional Council, in northern Israel.</p> \n<p>Recently he moved from Atzmon to central Tel Aviv. He rarely visits the Galilee home where his wife, Dorit, a psychotherapist and family and couples counselor, still lives. It’s possible that the house will soon be put up for sale. That will be the finale to a 34-year-chapter of his life.</p> \n<p>“I’m already emotionally disconnected from this place,” he told me last week, during a rare visit to the Atzmon dwelling. Perched on the slope of a hill, it overlooks the endless green of Segev Forest and, in the distance, a thin strip of blue – the coastline between Acre and Haifa Bay. “It’s not that I don’t have feelings for the house, for what’s enshrined in it, for the experiences and the memories,” Oz continues, “but the [Misgav] villages themselves are too highly charged for me.”</p> \n<p>He arrived at the decision to leave six years ago, when the Atzmon council initiated an amendment to the regulations for admitting new residents. The new clause would commit the members of the community to a “Jewish-Zionist way of life.” The change was not confined to Atzmon, but came on the heels of a series of similar initiatives sponsored by other communities in the regional council, situated south of Carmiel. The trigger was a petition submitted to the High Court of Justice a decade ago by a couple from Sakhnin, an Arab city in Galilee. Their request to buy a plot of land in nearby Rakefet, one of the Misgav locales, was rejected by the admissions committee.</p> \n<p>In the wake of the petition, the High Court issued an interim injunction ordering that a lot be set aside for the couple. Not long afterward, additional Misgav communities, including Mitzpeh Aviv, Manof, Yuvalim and others, sought to make residence in them conditional on an expression of loyalty to the Zionist vision – in other words, effectively to block the entrance of Arabs.</p> \n<p>In Atzmon, the proposed amendment won a majority, but was not formally approved because it failed to get the required 75 percent of the residents’ votes. Still, that was no consolation for Oz, who had fought the initiative. “About 70 percent voted in favor, which is a dramatic majority, far from marginal. I took it as my failure,” he says.</p> \n<p>Oz, who is today 67, started to edge his way out. At first, he split his time between Atzmon and Tel Aviv, but gradually the city became the center of his life. He could have made do with a quiet transition explained by practical considerations: the desire to be close to children and grandchildren who live in the Tel Aviv area, the wearying long trips between the Galilee community and the Mediterranean city. But his defeat in the vote, and his disappointment in the place where he’d spent half his life, demanded a public reckoning.</p> \n<p>The result of this is “Strangers,” a recently published novel (“Hayu Lezarim,” in Hebrew), which recounts the love between a widower and a widow: Yossi, an expert in information security, and Jihan, a Haifa-based, Christian-Arab architect. Their relationship is forged against the backdrop of Yossi’s residence in a fictional Galilee community, Mitzpeh Ahim. So distraught are its residents at the exceptional relationship that they organize a public discussion about “the need to reformulate the moral basis on which the community’s life is based.” Riding the waves of suspicion and hostility, the village’s militant leadership initiates a revision of the regulations, under which the community defines itself as “Jewish-Zionist” in character. “Villages with a mission,” Oz calls them.</p> \n<p>“Whether they are intended to take over land in Judea and Samaria, to develop the Negev or to Judaize Galilee, these settlements were established as a mission of the Zionist project,” he explains. “I wanted to explore the dilemma of these small, closed communities through a test case of a widowed couple, and in the course of writing I found many points of resemblance between the communities. All of them display a type of domineering arrogance, stemming from the very mechanism by which you decide who will be allowed to enter and live among you. It’s like ‘The finest to the air force’ – you are accepted or not accepted, and those who are accepted have a feeling of being chosen.”</p> \n<p>‘It was a nightmare’</p> \n<p>“Strangers” is Israel Oz’s second novel. In 2012, he published “The Last Assembly” (in Hebrew), which dug into the bleeding wounds of the kibbutz enterprise, focusing on the exclusion of women rooted in the culture, despite to the egalitarian image of the kibbutzim.</p> \n<p>Oz, who has three children and five grandchildren, was born in Kiryat Ono. His parents were Holocaust survivors: His father escaped from the Lodz ghetto to Russia and joined the Red Army; his mother endured Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz. He grew up on the boundary between Ramat Gan and Bnei Brak, was an officer in the combat engineers and went on to study economics and sociology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The first Galilee chapter in his life began following his marriage and a lengthy trip abroad, when he was appointed director of the municipal community center in Kiryat Shmona. After the birth of their first child, a daughter, the family moved to Jerusalem, but in short order began seeking an escape hatch.</p> \n<p>“As an activist in Peace Now, I felt that the city didn’t allow me to live in it,” Oz says. “The way people spat in our faces during demonstrations was the proof. We made the decision to move after the demonstration in which Emil Grunzweig was killed [in 1983].”</p> \n<p>The family happened to visit Atzmon on a trip to Galilee and decided to stay: “It was a dream for us, like living in New Zealand. So we went through the whole insane process of the admissions committee, and we were accepted.”</p> \n<p>Oz has a vivid memory of that event. “It was a nightmare,” he recalls. “The conversation was mainly about ‘What will you contribute to us?’. So I dredged up fire-breathing speeches about what I’d contribute. Even after you’re accepted, and you move in, a year later you come up for a vote, which will decide whether your admission is final. So, for a year you walk around with a feeling of being in an audition, your head in the ground, not saying a thing in order not to make anyone angry.”</p> \n<p>Oz and his family passed the audition and became full-fledged members of Atzmon. There were families, however, that were asked to leave at the end of the trial period. One such case generated Oz’s initial doubts about the community. “You have to understand: People relocated, moved their entire lives life here, and after a year they’re kicked out. That totally shocked me. I went from door to door and asked, ‘Why are you expelling them? How are they different from you?’ Nothing helped.”</p> \n<p>In what way were they different? Were they Mizrahim?</p> \n<p>“No. Mizrahim [Jews of Middle Eastern origin] aren’t accepted in the first place. There are practically none in the Misgav communities, only a few here and there, just to show that they exist. With this couple, there was just a wave of talk against them. The husband was a bit too religious – he sometimes conducted prayers in the synagogue, or organized events relating to Jewish tradition – and all kinds of tales were told about his wife. That story made me feel terrible.”</p> \n<p>Apart from that episode, Oz tried to avoid confrontational situations. In any case, he had no time to get mired in the village’s internal politics. For about three years he was chief of staff for Finance Minister Avraham Shochat in the 1992 government of Yitzhak Rabin (“The most riveting, and in the end most disappointing period for me”). Afterward, he established an organizational consultancy firm and spearheaded a privatization process in about a dozen kibbutzim (“a process of change and recovery,” in his words).</p> \n<p>Betwixt and between, Oz tried to contribute his share by assuming public posts in Atzmon, including membership on the admissions committee. “I often felt uncomfortable there,” he relates. “I admit that I, too, fell into the trap. Because there are six-seven candidates for every place in the village, and you’re the one who has to choose, you end up deciding people’s fates. Nowadays the candidacies are almost irrelevant, because parents pass membership on to their children. In many communities it’s a closed caste. Where did this distorted notion of the ‘continuing son’ came from? This is state land, you know.”</p> \n<p>What kinds of reasons do the committees cite for rejecting people?</p> \n<p>“You don’t really have to give a reason – no minutes are taken. If we decided no, then it was no. The rationalizations are along the lines of ‘They don’t have two cars, so they’ll have a hard time getting along here,’ or, ‘It’ll be hard for them to make a living,’ ‘The relations between them don’t look good,’ or ‘Did you notice that he spoke the whole time and she was silent?’ There’s no end to it.”</p> \n<p>But the deep crisis Oz suffered was not engendered by his revulsion at the classification process: It was the initiative to amend the regulations at the beginning of the decade that “pushed me out,” he says, and elaborates, “I understood that I wanted to live in Israel, not in a Jewish-Zionist community. I don’t see myself as disconnected from Israeli society, and I have no interest in living inside a bubble that defines itself in a way that removes me from it. At that time it was still an inner decision. I didn’t complain about anyone, I didn’t give interviews and I didn’t raise a banner.”</p> \n<p>Oz channeled his protest into the new novel, whose climax is a tempestuous members’ meeting about revising the admission regulations. The advocates of revision resort to aggressive, militant rhetoric, with comments such as, “Where will we draw the line between Christians and Muslims?” and “Let them go live in [the nearby city of] Carmiel.”Afterward, Yossi finds graffiti on the concrete path leading to his house: “Only Jews live here.” That, too, draws its inspiration from a real event. In 2013, the inscription “No loyalty – no citizenship” was sprayed on the house being built in Rakefet by Fatana and Ahmed Zabidat, the Sakhnin couple who went to court after their request to live in that community was rejected on grounds of “social incompatibility.”</p> \n<p>At around the same time, Oz came across another instance of nationalism in a nearby community. “A couple who are friends of mine wanted to rent a room to students – an Arab couple from Haifa,” he recalls. “A small group from the community objected, a furor erupted, name-calling on the social networks, a meeting of the local committee was called to consider whether to rent to them or not. In the end, the students themselves decided to drop the idea. They told me, ‘We had pity on them [the owners of the house]; we couldn’t bear to see what they were going through.’ My friends also left in the wake of that case. Two years later, mediation between them and the community enabled them to return, but they’ve remained outsiders there.”</p> \n<p>The nationalist rhetoric in the Misgav Regional Council, where a high percentage of residents in its 35 communities vote for center-left parties, did not emerge in a vacuum. In 2011, the Knesset enacted the admissions committees law, which enshrined the right of “community settlements,” as they’re called, to reject people on grounds of “incompatibility with the social life in the community.” Even though the text of the law also prohibited discrimination on grounds of race, religion, sex, nationality, disability, personal status, age, parenthood, sexual proclivity, country of origin or political-party affiliation, its opponents argued that it contains vague and generalized criteria that will in practice allow for discrimination. Human rights groups, including Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, petitioned the High Court of Justice against the legislation. In 2014 the court, by a vote of 5-4, rejected the petitions on the grounds that the issue was “not ripe” for a decision.</p> \n<p>This effectively authorized the filtering of membership applications in community settlements situated in the Negev or Galilee and have no more than 400 households. Concomitantly, the classification procedures were standardized. In the first stage, the candidate appears before a “get-acquainted committee.” If the committee forms a favorable impression, the candidate is referred to an external assessment institution. Its recommendation is sent to a regional committee, only two of whose five members are from the community in question, and that committee decides whether to accept the family.</p> \n<p>The High Court defeat also spelled the end of “Misgav’s Future,” an organization of local residents who campaigned against the admissions committee law. Oz and I began our visit to the Misgav area in the community of Manof, at the home of Prof. Nimrod Luz, head of the sociology and anthropology department in Western Galilee College, who was one of the leaders of the Misgav’s Future project.</p> \n<p>“What riled me at the time was the intolerable disparity between the way people here perceive themselves and the way they behave in practice,” Luz told us. “A person can think whatever he wants in his head. We are all racists, we all like living with people who resemble us, that’s all legitimate. I also have no problem with people saying, ‘We are fascists, neo-Nazis or Judeo-Nazis.’ That really doesn’t interest me. What does infuriate me is the veneer of the pioneering ethos, the ideology.</p> \n<p>“Look at this house,” he continued. “It’s a bourgeois home. I have two cars parked in the yard, and the last time I held a hoe was when my wife asked me to pick sabras.”</p> \n<p>Luz launched his public activity in 2009, after the general assembly of Manof approved new regulations that required members to commit themselves to “the values of the Zionist movement, Israel’s heritage and the settlement of the Land of Israel.” Another clause asserted that “the community marks the Jewish commemorative days and holidays.”</p> \n<p>“I remember an argument I had with one of the supporters of the regulations, a classic left-wing voter, one of those who will shout ‘equality’ at every opportunity,” Luz said. “His arguments were, ‘You want to let Arabs in here,’ or ‘You’ll see that they’ll end up building a mosque.’ Just so you’ll understand the level of the phobias. As though the Arabs in Sakhnin were rubbing their hands and plotting how to screw the Jews of Galilee.”</p> \n<p>Oz, too, encountered similar allegations. “The conspiracy was said to be that it wasn’t just one or two couples who wanted to buy a plot, but that they were the vanguard,” he notes. “That in fact this was an organized, managed move, behind which was Adalah, with the support of the PLO. Insane stuff.”</p> \n<p>At the same time, Luz believes that the focus on the national element in the discourse is a mere distraction. “Don’t take it to a place of a Jewish-Arab dialogue, that’s bullshit,” he asserts. “The Arabs have long since understood that it’s pointless for them to submit their candidacies. The admissions committees have rejected mostly Jews over the years.”</p> \n<p>Oz agrees. “The easiest thing is to talk about Arabs,” he says, “but the Jewish-Zionist clauses are the cover story for a filtering mechanism that allows people to replicate themselves.”</p> \n<p>Alongside the official refusals, Oz says, there are hidden mechanisms of exclusion: informal advance conversations about filtering the candidates, delay and evasiveness in replying, heaped-up bureaucratic hurdles and the like. “I know a woman who submitted an application to be accepted to Misgav on three separate occasions,” he recalls, “and each time she was told, ‘the list is already closed.’”</p> \n<p>For his part, Luz gets up and shows us the ultimate proof of the potency of these mechanisms: the Misgav telephone book. “Go over the names of the families,” he suggests, “90 percent are Ashkenazim.”</p> \n<p>‘I can’t compete’</p> \n<p>It takes us some time to leave Manof, because the heavy iron gate at the entrance takes quite a while to open, courtesy of a resident coming in at the same time. “That’s the worst thing,” Oz rails against the sliding steel structure.</p> \n<p>Arriving in Atzmon, we immediately enter Menash’s grocery store, the village’s nerve center. The store is empty, which is what you’d expect at midday in a bedroom community, but Menash, who himself lives in Haifa, says that things aren’t great in general, because many of the new families prefer the cheap shopping centers in Carmiel and even in Sakhnin. From Menash’s perspective, the thin trickle of buyers is a symptom of the collapse of solidarity in the community.</p> \n<p>“I can’t compete with the big chains, even though I have lowered my prices significantly,” he says. “People don’t understand that if they don’t buy milk and bread here from time to time, their children won’t have a place to buy a popsicle on the way home from school. The new families couldn’t care less. My lease is up in another three years, and to tell you the truth, I’m thinking of leaving.”</p> \n<p>In the clubhouse of the youth movement Hanoar Ha’oved (Working Youth), a woman in a hijab is washing the floor – who said there are no Arabs in Misgav? Opposite is the village office. People come up to Oz in the street, compliment him on his novel. They’re general compliments, moderate in tone. If they’re outraged at the book’s description of the Jewish settlement project in Galilee, they won’t let that be known publicly, still less in the presence of a journalist. That would violate the sacred community code: Don’t wash your dirty linen in public. The criticism, then, sometimes passes through a passive-aggressive filter.</p> \n<p>We go on to the Atzmon members’ club. “This is where it all happens,” Oz says, gesturing at the empty space, referring to the fraught assemblies that took place here at the beginning of the decade. By the way, last February the supporters of the revised regulations – which failed to get the necessary majority in the original vote – found a bypass route, in the form of a declaration titled “Vision for the Community,” which is separate from the regulations (at least for now).</p> \n<p>The “vision,” which passed with an overwhelming majority, states that the “public life” in Atzmon will bear a “Jewish secular character, in a community that promotes values of tolerance, human dignity, mutual responsibility and reciprocal relations between the members.” Another clause adds that the locale “maintains the values of the State of Israel in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and the values of Zionism in all its shades.”</p> \n<p>“What’s the range of the ‘shades’?” Oz wonders. “From where to where?”</p> \n<p>According to Ran Nofer, a psychotherapist and group moderator who is a central activist in the initiative for change, “the idea was to articulate the values of our community in a positive mode, to define who we are and how we want to be, especially with regard to our children. In addition, it’s important to define a vision for a small community, because the public character in small, closed communities can be undermined, unlike in big cities where it’s harder to do that.”</p> \n<p>In contrast to 2011, when the amendment with the required loyalty oath was under discussion, Nofer relates, the approval of the vision concept did not polarize the community or stir up the same emotions. The proof: Eighty-eight percent of the residents of Atzmon voted for it. The broad support was achieved because in this case the document is essentially declarative and not legally binding. Revisions in the formulation also played a part. The addition of the words “public” (“It was important for us to make it clear that we are not dealing with what people do in private, but with the values of the village’s public space,” Nofer explains) and “secular” (“to ease things for those who had difficulty with just the word ‘Jewish’”) placated most of the opponents.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s impossible to escape the impression that the purpose of the document is to exclude Arabs.</p> \n<p>Nofer: “That’s the question that always comes up: ‘Tell me, you don’t want Arabs?’ I try not to fall into that trap but to talk about the public space. I have an opinion about whether I want Arabs to live in my community, but it’s not relevant, because there is no clause in the law that prevents an Arab from living in a community settlement. I got involved because it was important for me to have the Jewish and Zionist character given expression. For example, for the flag to be hung at the entrance to the village on Independence Day and for our society to mark Jewish-Zionist holidays and commemorative dates.”</p> \n<p>Erez Kreisler, who was head of the Misgav Regional Council for 15 years and was Oz’s neighbor in Atzmon until not long ago, also agreed to respond to Oz’s allegations. When I spoke to him by phone this week, he told me that, “the Misgav community settlements are a startup whose advantages immeasurably outweigh their shortcomings. When I came to the area, in 1989, the image of Galilee was that of an enfeebled, wretched, even dangerous region. The Misgav communities established themselves in the region like an anchor of stability and excellence that projects across the whole surrounding area. If it were not for the consumer strength of the Misgav residents, Carmiel would not have developed as it did. Take, for example, the cultural center in Carmiel, where half the subscribers are from Misgav. Without them it would not have survived. Not to mention the development of the Bedouin villages within Misgav and the [independent] city of Sakhnin.”</p> \n<p>But when a couple from Sakhnin wanted to live in Misgav, they were hounded unmercifully. That is not exactly life together.</p> \n<p>“You are looking at it simplistically. I want to see someone from hamula A move in with hamula B [referring to Arab clans]. Straight off they will burn his house. I am in favor of life together, but on the basis of some sort of structure and framework. To create an infrastructure like that takes generations. We took a step in that direction, for example, by establishing a bilingual school at [Kibbutz] Eshbal. But I want to take you back to the events of October 2000, which pretty much shattered that fantasy for many Misgav residents [referring to protests and disturbances by Galilee Arabs, which resulted in 13 of them being shot to death by police]. Let me remind you that they tried to burn some of the Misgav villages.”</p> \n<p>In fact, Kreisler, too, recently left Atzmon for Tel Aviv (“for work and family reasons, not because of criticism of the community,” he emphasizes). But the buyers he found for his house, a model Jewish couple, were rejected by the village’s absorption committee on the usual vague grounds of “social incompatibility.” Kreisler had to find alternate purchasers. Nevertheless, he defends the process: “Harmony and social cohesion are important in a small community, and I think that it’s reasonable and logical for filtering to take place on the basis of transparent criteria.”</p> \n<p>“The depiction of Atzmon in [Oz’s] book, as it’s reflected in Mitzpeh Ahim, does the village an injustice,” Kreisler sums up. “It hurt me personally and did Atzmon a disservice. I regret that.”</p> \n<p>Judaizing Galilee</p> \n<p>I asked Oz what he thinks the logic behind the existence of such communities is. “Let’s deconstruct it,” he replied. “The settlements [in the territories] have a political purpose. The original purpose of the kibbutzim and moshavim was to demarcate the borders of the State of Israel, and today they are the major workers of the land – an aim whose worth cannot be overestimated. The community settlements were established to Judaize Galilee. They succeeded in that, by driving [physical] wedges between the Arab communities. Misgav is expanding horizontally, whereas the Arabs are made to build vertically.”</p> \n<p>Then what’s the difference between the Misgav Regional Council and a regional council in Samaria?</p> \n<p>“No difference. Same same, except for the endless resources the state pumps into the settlements.”</p> \n<p>What about the ethos of Arab-Jewish coexistence that some settlers talk about proudly. Is this a similar situation in Misgav?</p> \n<p>“That’s the biggest bluff. I once spoke with a senior figure in Gush Etzion [Etzion settlement bloc, in the West Bank], who lives in the heart of the Gush Etzion junction, which is all concrete barricades and fenced in. He’s explaining to me how the Arabs have it good with them, they earn a living, and if you asked them, they would prefer to stay with us. And he really believes that. So, yes, in Misgav, too, the adjacent Arab population is a very significant supplier of labor and services: construction work, gardening, etc. Apart from that, most of the residents are completely cut off from the Arab communities around them.”</p> \n<p>Leaving the territory of the regional council, we enter the nearby town of Arabeh and stop at Abu Samer’s hummus place. Oz mentions this place in his novel, claiming, through the character of Yossi, that it has “the best hummus in the country,” an assertion validated by Jihan who delights in the “hummus with chickpeas, the warm falafel and the thinly sliced salad.” In the restaurant, Oz pulls out a copy of “Strangers,” opens it to the page with the hummus scene and hands it to the waiter.</p> \n<p>“Well, bro, did I give you good publicity?” he asks the waiter a few minutes later. The waiter mumbles something unclear. “They don’t understand, it’s amazing how they don’t know how to read here,” Oz says, in the wake of the waiter’s indifference.</p> \n<p>The characters in Oz’s novel speak in a similar linguistic register, and sometimes they seem to be speechifying. For example, when Avner, one of Yossi’s few allies in the community, says in despair, “If here, in an Ashkenazi-bourgeois-liberal-center-left village, an absolute majority voted for racist regulations, then it’s a lost cause, the country is going to hell. Everyone’s a settler, and everything is permitted to Jews who suffered, and what’s happening here in this community is proof that a true left never existed in Israel.”</p> \n<p>In general, the impression sometimes seems to be that political urgency, and not poetic momentum, is the engine that drives the plot narrative. Oz doesn’t necessarily dispute this analysis. “Israeli literature misses the target by not dealing with the bleeding wounds of Israeliness,” he avers. “People write about the flowers in the garden and not about the garden of predators – the zoo – that is our society.</p> \n<p>“In my opinion,” he continues, “silence is not an option, so I see writing as a type of commitment. To turn the spotlight on a place like Misgav, which is a microcosm of Israeli society, and say: Look what’s happening here. And these aren’t the militants of the right, not the settlers, not [the extremist group] Lehava and not Bibi’s factionalism. They are you.”</p> \n<p>Oz constantly emphasizes Jihan’s Christianity, not least by having her exclaim “Jesus Christ!” throughout the novel. Oz: “I didn’t choose a hijab-wearing Muslim woman who’s a maid, but a Christian from Haifa, a successful academic. Just like us! That’s the type of woman that the man [Yossi] connects with, so why don’t people accept her?”</p> \n<p>In other words, you find the connection between a Jewish man and Muslim woman too extreme. Maybe your enlightenment also has its limits?</p> \n<p>“No. I did a great deal of soul-searching, and Jihan changed her attitude during the writing. I think that if she were a Muslim, the waves of hostility around her would be so powerful that the relationship would not survive. The book would have had to end at page 40. Precisely because of her class traits and because she’s a Christian, a clash is created between the most credible relationship and the most unbelievable reality [of their not being accepted as a couple]. After all, it’s clear that we hate the Muslims.”</p> \n<p>That’s the point. In the Israeli dialogue, there’s a deeply rooted distinction between the Christians, who are “the good Arabs” and are considered successful, secular and aspiring to social involvement, and the Muslims, who are perceived as weakened, fanatic, dangerous and so on. Doesn’t the book validate that stereotype?</p> \n<p>“I can’t really tell you. The potential for the existence of an affair between a Jewish man and a Muslim woman seems poor to me, and my commitment was to the story’s internal logic and the cornerstones that would allow it to develop. I’m afraid that if she were a Muslim, her fate would be similar to that of the protagonist in Dorit Rabinyan’s novel ‘All the Rivers.’ After all, if [Education Minister Naftali] Bennett had read her book to the end before disqualifying it [for reading in high school], he would have discovered that the Israeli wet dream in which the Arab drowns in the sea is realized there.”</p> \n<p>Our last stop is the Misgav industrial park. The word “park” suits the site – it’s not gray and rusting, like most industrial zones. Agricultural plots are scattered between the factories, in front of which purple bougainvillea splurge and meticulously trimmed lemon trees grow. This handsome park overlooks the valley in which Sakhnin lies, squeezed between the headquarters of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, the military contractor, and the communities of Yuvalim and Eshbal. “Look at how tens of thousands live in dense concentration in Sakhnin,” Oz says, pointing, “and you saw how those in Misgav live, in contrast.”</p> \n<p>Not “those” – you.</p> \n<p>“My address is listed in the Interior Ministry as Tel Aviv, I have a Tel Aviv parking sticker, in local elections I vote in Tel Aviv, and I pay my property tax to my friend Ron Huldai [mayor of Tel Aviv].”</p> \n<p>You can’t erase 30 years so easily.</p> \n<p>“You’re right, erasing is impossible.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Mylan, the most valuable company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, announced on Friday that it will voluntarily delist its shares from the TASE in February 2018. The pharmaceutical company, whose shares account for 7% of the value of the TA-35 index, committed to maintaining the listing for at least one year when it listed its shares on the TASE in November 2015, as part of its failed bid to acquire rival drugmaker Perrigo.</p> \n<p>For the TASE, the announcement heralded the biggest blow since the delisting of Mellanox in 2013.</p> \n<p>“Over the last two years, we have learned that many of our Israeli institutional shareholders actually hold their shares in Mylan on the Nasdaq,” Mylan Chairman Robert Coury said. “Further, Mylan’s holding on the TASE represents less than 3.5% of our total shareholdings and the average trading volume on the TASE is less than 3.5% of our global trading volume. Given these factors and the fact that the TASE’s trading hours and days are different from other markets, our board of directors decided at this time that it would not be in Mylan’s best interests to continue our listing on the TASE. That said, we do appreciate the ties we have forged with the Israeli institutional market,” he said.</p> \n<p>Coury continued, “More importantly, over the last two years, I have had the privilege of becoming acquainted with the dynamic Israeli business environment and the strong work ethic of its people. As a result, we remain committed to considering future investments and other business development opportunities in Israel.” His comments echoed those he made in February 2016, on his second visit to Israel, shortly after Mylan was listed on the TASE.</p> \n<p>He said then that he was committed to the TASE and that he was proving this. “I think the listing should be limited in time. I will be involved in developing business in Israel and we’ve already started investigating investment opportunities. We intend to set up a subsidiary here as well. The only negative aspect I see in operating here is that Israel is a small country, but this doesn’t really matter in light of the level of intellect and technology here,” he said. As far as is known, these festive words were not expressed in any significant investments here.</p> \n<p>8.5% of the Tel Aviv stock market</p> \n<p>Mylan was listed for trade in Tel Aviv in November 2015, as part of a failed attempt to convince institutional investors in Israel who held shares in Perrigo pharmaceuticals to support Mylan’s offer to buy Perrigo. Mylan committed to list its shares for trading in Tel Aviv for at least one year. Mylan’s offer was rejected by Perrigo’s shareholders by a majority of 60%, largely due to the position taken by Israeli institutional investors. This decision turned out to have been a mistake, since Mylan offered $75 million in cash and 2.3 Mylan shares for each Perrigo one. The current value of the offer is $162.8 million, a premium of 86% on the current value of Perrigo shares.</p> \n<p>Israeli institutional investors have increased their holdings in Mylan since then after realizing that the quality of management there is significantly better than at Teva. They currently hold 8% of the company’s capital, worth 5.6 billion shekels ($1.59 billion) at the end of August. Mylan has in recent months become the highest valued stock in Israel, after the collapse of Teva. It is now traded at a valuation of 70.6 billion shekels, as of closing time on Thursday and before a cumulative 2.5% rise on Nasdaq. Perrigo traded at a value of 45 billion shekels and Teva at 46.5 billion shekels.</p> \n<p>The market value of Mylan comprises 8.5% of the total value of stocks and convertible securities on the TASE. The average trading in Mylan shares was 36 million shekels last month, which is 3.5% of the average trade in stocks and convertibles on the exchange.</p> \n<p>Mylan makes up 7% of the TA-35 index and 5% of the TA-125 index. Delisting it is expected to change these indices and lead to an increase in the purchase of mutual funds and ETFs that follow these indices, and to an exchange of these shares for others in the same indices.</p> \n<p>Along with the expected hit to the volume of trade on the TASE there is a positive aspect to the delisting of Mylan – a better balance in the TA-35 index, which has suffered from a bias toward shares of pharmaceutical companies. The combined weight of the four largest companies traded on the TASE Mylan, Teva, Perrigo and Opko was 22% of the index. This exposed the index to the fluctuations in the valuation of these companies in the United States, thus making it nonrepresentative of financial activity in Israel.</p> \n<p>The CEO of the Israel Association of Publicly Traded Companies, Ilan Plato, said in response to Mylan’s announcement that “Mylan’s delisting is a painful blow to the efforts to revive activity on the exchange and it will certainly reduce the volume of trade and increase the liquidity trap on the Israeli market. We repeat our call to the Finance Ministry and the Tax Authority to take operative steps to encourage trade and reduce taxation of profits in the stock market.”</p>",

Hezbollah relies on them (Iran) for the resources necessary to continue the battle. This is really about Iran continuing to extend their ability to influence other governments in that region.”  Yet, Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), who has met Hariri multiple times, urged caution. While noting that he is trying to further investigate the true causes of Hariri's resignation, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee added, “maybe there was another reason that he stepped down.”&nbsp;The location for Hariri’s announcement was also troubling for Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA). “The resignation is extremely suspicious that he would resign on a trip to Saudi Arabia rather than in Lebanon. The press in the region is speculating that he may be in some sort of detention,” said the 2016 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate. “Iran and Saudi Arabia’s proxy war is crushing people in this region.” [JewishInsider]  &quot;Trump’s Secret Weapon: The Hidden Ties That Bind Israel, Saudis&quot; by Jonathan Ferziger:&nbsp;&quot;A Netanyahu aide... said Iran now threatens so many countries that it’s natural for Israel’s alarm to be shared by others...&nbsp;“It’s very possible that Saudi Arabia and Israel are forming a joint strategy toward Hezbollah and Iran,” said Alireza Nader, a policy analyst at Rand Corp. “While Saudi Arabia may have some diplomatic and economic sway over Lebanon, it cannot fight Hezbollah militarily. But Israel has the capability to strike.” That doesn’t mean it wants to -- at least for now. “We may have to confront Hezbollah sooner or later,” Ofer Shelach, a member of the foreign affairs and defense committee in Israel’s parliament, said in an interview. “But everyone wants to put off this confrontation.”&quot; [Bloomberg]  &quot;AP Interview: Israel planning UN action against Iran&quot; by Josef Federman:&nbsp;&quot;Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told The Associated Press that he believes conditions are ripe to take a stand against Iranian actions in the region, including its support for the Lebanese Shiite militant group...&nbsp;“Israel has made clear what its red lines are and we will stand by those red lines,” he said.&quot; [AP]  RJC'S MATT BROOKS'&nbsp;DISPATCH&nbsp;FROM ISRAEL:&nbsp;Brooks is accompanying Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who is on a weeklong&nbsp;trade mission sponsored by the Republican Jewish Coalition and the Hawthorn Foundation. &quot;This is a really important trip,&quot; Brooks told Jewish Insider's Jacob Kornbluh&nbsp;in a phone interview. &quot;Eric Greitens not only is the only Jewish governor in the country, but also given his background as a former Navy SEAL and the fact that he is somebody who is a real serious and real rising star, I think the relationships, and the meetings, and the briefings, and all of the aspects of this trip are going to be very, very helpful for him in terms of his ability to go back and to stand up and be a leader on the pushback against BDS and to be a vocal supporter for the Jewish community.&quot;&nbsp;  Brooks on the newly-launched Jewish&nbsp;Democratic&nbsp;Council of America: &quot;Any group that wants to be both a pro-Israel advocacy group and pro-Democratic Party group has got to work to hold the Democratic Party back to its original moorings and its original anchor within the mainstream of the pro-Israel movement. Unfortunately, there are forces that are trying to pull the Democratic Party away from its traditional alliances with Israel, and we see that time and time again with the rise of the progressive left, and the J Street folks... No group will be successful unless it works to address and to hold the Democratic Party back where it needs to be, and the party of Joe Lieberman, and Scoop Jackson, and the Democrats who were unapologetically pro-Israel.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>HEARD YESTERDAY -- Gary Cohn on the similarities between President Trump and former boss Llyod Blankfein:&nbsp;&quot;They're both very driven.

He attended the University of California, Los Angeles, as an undergraduate and then went to law school at George Washington University.&nbsp;In his recent interview, he said that the Justice Department did not need to intervene just because a company was big, even a monopoly.

The neighborhood exploded... In his office a quarter-century later, Mr. Dinkins dismissed a question about whether, had he changed tactics one night sooner, he might have won re-election. “You don’t know that until after the fact,” he said. “I said to the police brass, Whatever you guys are doing, it ain’t working.

        "text":["<p>Lehava is a dangerous organization. Israelis have read and heard numerous news reports about its dangers in recent years: day camps to train for incitement, open threats against Arabs and Christians including calls to burn down churches, and actual arson against the bilingual school in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>We at the Reform movement’s Israel Religious Action Center have been following the organization’s sophisticated work for years. Lehava’s head, Bentzi Gopstein, often comes to Zion Square in downtown Jerusalem with the goal to turn the city center into an “Arab-free” zone, in his own words. The group recruits at-risk youths and uses methods of incitement, intimidation and violence against Arabs, aiming to create a separation between Jews and Arabs and prevent the chance for coexistence.</p> \n<p>Gopstein claims that the organization strives to prevent Jewish assimilation and saves young Jewish women, who allegedly are kidnapped daily by Arabs. These claims are absurd and ridiculous; the police confirm that not a single woman has been kidnapped by Arabs in recent years. The percentage of marriages between Jewish women and Arab men in Israel is tiny. Gopstein operates like other racists out of history and generates an unfounded fear of Arab men.</p> \n<p>The big problem is the cooperation the organization receives from the law enforcement authorities. Over the past seven years, we at the Israel Religious Action Center have filed dozens of complaints with the police about Gopstein’s actions, and have been shocked by the gross disregard for the evidence, the police’s blindness in not responding to violence, and the erasing of the stories of the violence’s victims.</p> \n<p>In practice, the security of young Arab men in Jerusalem, who suffer verbal and physical violence by Lehava activists, has been ignored. The police, who are out in force in the center of Jerusalem, do not respond to complaints by Arabs who have been attacked, in the best case, and threaten or arrest them, in the worst.</p> \n<p>At the top stands the attorney general, who for years considered the police’s recommendations to charge Gopstein without reaching a decision. Last week, one day before the government was due to respond to the High Court of Justice on a petition, we demanded that the attorney general and prosecutors justify why Gopstein hadn’t been put on trial in response to hundreds of statements that detail incitement to violence and racism. Only then did the prosecution announce its intention to indict him.</p> \n<p>Lehava is a small and extremist organization that disgusts most Israelis. The decision to try Gopstein gives such people an opportunity to demand that the police, prosecution and attorney general stop ignoring the racist incitement spread by the organization.</p> \n<p>This is the opportunity to expose Lehava’s true actions, which have no connection whatsoever to Judaism. Without enforcement, the extreme and impassioned discourse takes over. Ignoring the racist incitement creates a slippery slope of lawlessness and violence that endangers Israeli democracy and us all.</p> \n<p>Only when the law enforcement system functions properly does the moderate majority have a chance to curb extremism. Only then is it possible to create a safe egalitarian space. The fabric of the shared society in Jerusalem is especially delicate and needs protection. The public will support and strengthen the authorities if they act to protect sanity and democracy.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Noa Sattath is the director of the Reform movement’s Israel Religious Action Center.</p>",

Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, and replace him with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, within the next several weeks, senior administration officials said on Thursday.&nbsp;Mr. Pompeo would be replaced at the C.I.A. by Senator Tom Cotton...&nbsp;It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump has given final approval to the plan John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, developed the transition plan and has discussed it with other officials.”&nbsp;[NYTimes]  According to a media&nbsp;advisory, Sen.&nbsp;Cotton is expected to participate in a Saban Forum panel&nbsp;discussion&nbsp;this weekend&nbsp;together with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and moderated by Jeffrey Goldberg. The panel is titled &quot;Before Sunset: The Iran Deal and What to Do About It&quot; &nbsp;  DRIVING THE CONVO: &quot;Trump administration considers moving U.S. embassy in Israel” by Vivian Salama:&nbsp;“Israeli media reports Wednesday indicated that President Donald Trump does intend to move the embassy [to Jerusalem] and that a decision could come as early as Sunday. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said those reports were “premature,” adding, &quot;we have nothing to announce.&quot;  “This step would kill the possibility of a peace deal any time soon,” said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “The Arab states would be furious. The Jordanians would be worried. The Palestinians would walk away from any discussion.” &quot;I would be surprised if they made an announcement about moving it before they come out with their peace initiative because it would undercut the initiative,” said Dennis Ross, the U.S. point man on the peace process in both the George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. &quot;The problem is everyone sees Jerusalem through an emotional lens and it’s so easy to misportray this.” [NBCNews]&nbsp;  KAFE KNESSET -- The View From Israel On The Embassy Move&nbsp;-- by Tal Shalev and JPost's Lahav Harkov: Two senior Israeli politicians told Kafe Knesset they believe “this time it is serious,” citing internal pressure from Trump’s evangelical base as the main impetus for the announcement. These officials pointed to the statement by VP Pence earlier this week about the White House “actively considering how and when” to make the Embassy move. On the other hand, this morning King Abdullah II of Jordan already made clear what he thinks about an Embassy move. Other senior Israeli insiders expressed concern that the Channel 2 report itself could have thwarted any intent to make a policy change on the subject at this time.  The latest with the Netanyahu investigations: After months of chasing him around the globe, the Israeli Police have finally caught up to Australian billionaire James Packer and collected his testimony in File 1000, a/k/a the Gift Affair. Packer was questioned this week by Australian and Israeli investigators in Australia. Packer gave his version of events in response to allegations that he partnered with US billionaire Arnon Milchan, to give gifts and presents to the Netanyahu couple. Now, the police intend to question Netanyahu again, and confront him with Packer’s testimony, but according to various reports, they already have sufficient evidence to conclude the investigation and intend to finalize it and submit a recommendation for indictment by the end of the year.  However, there is a race between the Police and Bibi’s Knesset loyalists, coalition chairman David Bitan and MK Dudi Amsalem, who are vigorously promoting the Police Recommendations bill, that is aimed at preventing the publication of Police conclusions and recommendations on criminal affairs involving public and elected officials, and leave that to the Attorney General.

Citing reports of Hezbollah activity in Yemen, Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) asserted, “There is simply no way Saudi Arabia would allow for Hezbollah to gain a presence in Yemen and then build up an arsenal and presence on the Saudi border.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tamara Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brooking Institute, offered a different viewpoint of Riyadh's military campaign in Yemen. “The Saudi decision to intervene in Yemen appears impetuous and ill-considered, miring the Kingdom in a military quagmire, producing a nightmarish level of human suffering, and strengthening both Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula and Iran,” she charged.  “The Saudis are no longer willing to prop up Lebanon while it serves as the base for Hezbollah’s military and terrorist activities in league with Iran,” said Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It is not Mohammed bin Salman who is bringing danger to Lebanon,&nbsp;it is not the Saudis who are bringing Lebanon into the region’s wars,&nbsp;it is not Saudi policy that threatens to collapse Lebanon’s coalition politics. It is the actions of Hezbollah, abandoning any national role to act as Iran’s enforcer and foreign legion.”  Ranking Subcommittee member Ted Deutch (D-FL) expressed concern about the Trump administration’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. “I’m worried that the current administration’s sole focus on the strategic relationship, while ignoring other aspects, does not help provide full American leadership on issues vital to the U.S. like human rights in the broader region,” Deutch noted. Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) added, “I’m concerned that he (Kushner) has no idea what he’s doing. He has no foreign policy experience and zero foreign policy credentials,” [JewishInsider]  “Will Israel launch pre-emptive strike against Assad?” by Ben Caspit:&nbsp;“What disturbs the Israeli officers more is the Iranian &quot;Precision [Missile] Project,&quot; intended to provide Assad and Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah with the capability to manufacture their own rockets and missiles.&nbsp;As one top Israeli minister told Al-Monitor..., &quot;For that, we would need to consider going to war.

The source added that Kushner took other &quot;ridiculous&quot; political actions early in the administration, including inviting Michael Berland, a former adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, into the Oval Office to brief the president on multiple occasions.

That Ivanka is thinking about how all of this can translate into a post-White House life, to people who know her, is unsurprising. “Everything to Ivanka is a business transaction,” one person who has known her since childhood recently told me. “She’s Donald.”” [VanityFair]&nbsp;  “Peter Thiel Turns Down a Senior Intelligence Role” by Rosie Gray:&nbsp;“The PayPal cofounder and billionaire investor Peter Thiel recently withdrew his name from consideration to lead the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board Thiel informed the White House of his decision earlier this month, said one of the sources.” [TheAtlantic]&nbsp;  &quot;We’re All Part of Trump’s Show&quot; by Bret Stephens: &quot;The president is conducting a kind of meta-politics, the purpose of which is to erase ordinary standards of political judgment.

        "text":["<p>'We wanted to meet on neutral ground, and the weather here is nice,' says the South African half of an online couple whose first face-to-face meeting took place at Ben-Gurion Airport. (Departures / arrivals, Oct. 13, 2016)</p> \n<p>Beyers Coedzee, 52, lives in Johannesburg, arriving from there; and Vera Lamnci, 49, lives in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, arriving from Moscow</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask where you know each other from?</p> \n<p>Beyers: We met in February on a site called&nbsp;PenPal World, and since then we’ve exchanged emails. This is actually our first face-to-face meeting. The first time I saw her was five minutes ago.</p> \n<p>Vera, what’s it like to meet after months of corresponding?</p> \n<p>Vera (in English): I don’t speak English very well.</p> \n<p>Beyers: It will be hard for you to interview her in English.</p> \n<p>She doesn’t understand? You didn’t correspond in English?</p> \n<p>Beyers: No, we did it through Google Translate. I wrote in English, she wrote in Russian, and each of us translated into his/her language.</p> \n<p>How will you get along now?</p> \n<p>Beyers: If we get into a tangle, we can send each other WhatsApp messages, because that also has Google Translate. Vera is very good at it. She writes Russian in a way that gets translated into English in a simple way.</p> \n<p>What did you write each other about?</p> \n<p>Beyers: All kinds of things: about life, Buddhism, movies, computer games. I think we pretty much talked about everything.</p> \n<p>Do you think correspondence is a good way to get to know someone?</p> \n<p>Beyers: I’m not sure, but what is certain is that when you meet that way, you have to stay in touch. There’s no way just to chill out.</p> \n<p>It sounds to me like it’s very “chilled”: no need to comb your hair, get dressed </p> \n<p>Beyers: When you don’t see one another, you have to be creative all the time; you have to think about what you’re writing and how things are taken by the other person. It’s hard work, but very rewarding.</p> \n<p>Was it your goal to meet someone on the website?</p> \n<p>Beyers: It’s important for me to explain that PenPal World is not a dating website. Obviously some people use it that way, but that’s not the aim. I have never met a woman via the internet and I have never been registered at a dating site of any kind. I even wrote in my PenPal World profile that I wasn’t looking for a romantic attachment.</p> \n<p>So how did it happen?</p> \n<p>Beyers: At first I corresponded with a few people — Vera was only one of them. The correspondence between us started as a conversation and developed from there. Time passed and she was the only one I continued to write to — and it turned romantic.</p> \n<p>Why do you think the conversations continued specifically with her?</p> \n<p>Beyers: I met many interesting people on the website, but Vera and I share quite a few interests. What’s more important is that she has the same outlook on life.</p> \n<p>Which is?</p> \n<p>Beyers: Patience and acceptance. Not to get annoyed by trivial things, and always to be ready for an adventure.</p> \n<p>And how did you decide on this particular adventure — to meet in Israel?</p> \n<p>Beyers: I don’t remember the exact moment when it happened, but the subject came up three months ago. We wanted to meet on neutral ground, and the weather here is nice.</p> \n<p>Is it the first time here for both of you?</p> \n<p>Beyers: I was here once when I was 16, mainly in Jerusalem. But this time we plan to be in Tel Aviv, which looks like a terrific city. We’ll be here for eight days.</p> \n<p>Isn’t it a bit stressful to spend eight days with someone you’ve just met? What if you don’t get along?</p> \n<p>Beyers: We didn’t know if we would get along, and we still don’t know. We’ve known each other now for exactly 10 minutes, five of which have been spent talking with you — mainly by me. I even considered the possibility that I would show up here and she wouldn’t — or, even weirder, that a woman would show up but not the one from the photos.</p> \n<p>Didn’t you even talk on Skype?</p> \n<p>Beyers: No, not even once. It seemed pointless, as I don’t understand Russian and she can’t speak English.</p> \n<p>What would you like to happen now?</p> \n<p>Beyers: I have no expectations or hopes, and it’s important for me that it’s like that. We talked about how it was important for neither of us to have expectations, because it’s impossible to promise things. We just wanted to be together. I think we will understand what’s happening when we progress. It’s definitely liable to be problematic.</p> \n<p>Kholod Kabha, 27, and Walid Kabha, 28, with their son Amir, 20 months; live in Umm al-Khattaf, Galilee; flying to Antalya, Turkey</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask if this is the little one’s first trip?</p> \n<p>Kholod: Yes, it is. The last time we traveled he was too little, and he stayed with Grandma.</p> \n<p>How will he get along?</p> \n<p>Kholod: We don’t know yet; we’ll see how it goes.</p> \n<p>You’re taking a family holiday now, after the summer vacation?</p> \n<p>Walid: Yes. I don’t fly during holidays, I wait until everything is back to normal. Otherwise, you get to the flight and the whole village is there with you.</p> \n<p>Kholod: I arrive at the destination and it’s like I’m walking around in the village. Also, there’s no pressure on us now.</p> \n<p>Walid: We went through a tough time; now we’ll rest a little.</p> \n<p>What happened?</p> \n<p>Kholod: We have another son, a 7-month-old infant who was born prematurely at the end of the eighth month, 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds). He was in the neonatal ICU for six weeks and had a problem gaining weight. It’s called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): babies that are born early and underweight.</p> \n<p>How is he now?</p> \n<p>Kholod: Better. He’s with Grandma.</p> \n<p>Sounds scary.</p> \n<p>Kholod: It’s the first time I’ve left him, so it’s hard — but knowing he’s with Grandma, I’m not worried in the least.</p> \n<p>I meant in the hospital.</p> \n<p>Kholod: It was hard. There were good, kind people there, but it was a bit of a trauma for us. I was stressed the whole time, there were always a lot of tests. I cried a lot. I was afraid he would come out with some sort of defect. And he had another problem, as well: a high blood-oxygen level and fluid in the lung. I pumped milk and breast-fed him, but when he got sick I couldn’t breast-feed him for a week. I only pumped milk and there wasn’t very much, because at that stage there is less from pumping.</p> \n<p>Sounds like a nightmare.</p> \n<p>Kholod: After three weeks I couldn’t get up in the morning anymore. I told Walid I didn’t want to go to the hospital again, it was too much. I would go there from 9 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon so I could breast-feed him three times. It was also hard, because I left Amir with Grandma for so long. He was just a year old and cried all the time.</p> \n<p>Walid: Even when we got home, the whole place was like an ICU.</p> \n<p>Kholod: By the time I stopped pumping, I already had a drawer full of bags of milk in the freezer.</p> \n<p>Walid: The bedroom was a clinic. We were always cleaning, for fear of germs. Even now there are tests to do all the time.</p> \n<p>Are things all right now?</p> \n<p>Kholod: Everything is fine now. He’s gaining weight little by little.</p> \n<p>How did Walid cope?</p> \n<p>Kholod: Walid calmed me down every day.</p> \n<p>Walid: I’m a preemie, too — I was born at the start of the ninth month.</p> \n<p>Kholod: Me, too. I was born at the end of the eighth month. Walid also had a problem gaining weight as a newborn.</p> \n<p>Walid: She interrogated my mother about it.</p> \n<p>Kholod: We had an odd moment at the hospital. The nurse asked me, “What are those movements you’re using with the baby? Only I know those movements.” I told her I’d learned them from my mother-in-law. She asked me if my husband had been a preemie. I told her he had, and it turned out that she was the nurse who looked after Walid — she taught his mother how to treat him.</p> \n<p>Walid: She treated both of us, me and my son.</p> \n<p>Looks like you came out of it great.</p> \n<p>Kholod: But his mother said he was very irritable as a baby. His case remains open in the child development unit, because he refused to cooperate with them.</p> \n<p>Did Amir make trouble?</p> \n<p>Kholod: He was healthy, even overweight.</p> \n<p>Do you want more children?</p> \n<p>Walid: I don’t.</p> \n<p>Kholod: I do, but not now.</p> \n<p>Walid: It’s enough.</p> \n<p>Kholod: I want a daughter in a couple of years, when the little one will be 3.</p> \n<p>Walid: Three years it’s in God’s hands. I don’t want to think about it now.</p> \n<p>Kholod: Anyway, it was worth it.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Pending before Judge Avraham Dan Rubin in the Jerusalem District Court, sitting as a court for administrative matters, is the petition of Mahmoud Ziyadah. Ziyadah, 25, from the village of Madama, south of the West Bank city of Nablus, seeks to have his entry permit into Israel restored. He want to be able to continue to support, modestly but respectably, his small family (himself, his wife, their daughter and their unborn son).</p> \n<p>In the absence of a permit, Ziyadah will be unable to attend the court session in his case scheduled for Wednesday, that is so important for his future. Ziyadah is represented by attorney Tamir Blank. Attached to the petition is a letter of recommendation from a Jewish contractor who needs Ziyadah.</p> \n<p>Lior Skverer, a senior deputy prosecutor for the Jerusalem district, wants the petition rejected outright. In his response to the petition, he cited previous court rulings showing (the language is mine) that it’s not Israel’s problem that Palestinians can’t find work in the West Bank enclaves or that their wages are insufficient to support a family. </p> \n<p>Perhaps the judge already decided to deny the petition without considering Ziyadah and the future of his children. There’s no way to know. On the other hand, maybe he’s been reading World Bank reports saying the Palestinian economy is faltering due to Israeli restrictions. Perhaps he has also been reading professional army opinions stating that employing Palestinians in Israel is actually a stabilizing factor both socially and with respect to security. </p> \n<p>Skverer also cited the position of the Shin Bet security service, according to which Ziyadah poses a threat to Israeli security, writing: “The updated opinion of security officials is that ‘it is known that [Ziyadah] was involved in a confrontation with army forces during which stones were thrown at the forces.’”</p> \n<p>A confrontation? On February 10 of this year, a Friday, several residents of his village went on a nature hike. The group included Ziyadah’s brother and his brother’s family. Armed soldiers suddenly appeared, demanding that they get off their land, which, by the way is Area B of the West Bank, and is therefore under Palestinian civilian control but Israel security control. </p> \n<p>Ziyadah’s brother Ahmed, who is a volunteer with the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem and was therefore equipped with a video camera from the organization, refused to leave. This is our land, he said. The soldiers, who came down from one of the unauthorized outposts in the area of the settlement of Yitzhar pounced on him, hitting and shackling him. </p> \n<p>News of the incident spread throughout the village, and Mahmoud did what any brother would do. He ran to the spot to try to calm the situation. With his brother on the ground and the soldiers on top of him, Mahmoud, from a few meters away, implored them to stop. He was unarmed and his arms were raised. A soldier shot him right in the knee. When it’s cold, it still hurts. When he recovered and sought to return to work in Israel, Mahmoud discovered that his work permit had been revoked. </p> \n<p>When the Israeli army spokesman explained the soldiers’ actions at the time to Haaretz, he made no mention of stone-throwing. So how did the stones come up now in the prosecutor’s response? In a reply to a question from Haaretz on Sunday, the Shin Bet spokesman’s office said that they were unable to provide a response because the matter was pending in court. </p> \n<p>The prosecutor had another arrow in his quiver. The Shin Bet said that “the petitioner has ties to Hamas activists in his village.” Details, he wrote, could be provided to the judge in an ex parte proceeding, “as it involved classified intelligence, the disclosure of the details or sources of which could harm state security and public order.” Does saying good morning to a neighbor on the street or at the grocery also constitute ties? </p> \n<p>The prosecution and the Shin Bet intended to try to convince the judge that just when Ziyadah was recovering from his injury and attempting to get his work permit back, he also made contact with Hamas. After all, before his injury, he obtained a permit without a problem. </p> \n<p>There’s a twist in the plot: Shortly before this piece went to print, Ziyadah’s lawyer received a communication signed by Ishay Arkash, the attorney general’s representative in the Jerusalem district prosecutor’s office. </p> \n<p>“In light of the passage of time,” Arkash wrote, “and from an up-to-date examination by security officials, their position is that so long as no new information is received about the petitioner before February 2018, a new request [for a permit] — will be favorably considered.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Following a relatively swift investigation, a former Israeli combat soldier was cleared of allegations that he assaulted an unarmed Palestinian during a tour of duty in Hebron.</p> \n<p>It might have been cause for celebration, had the soldier not been the one to bring the allegations against himself.</p> \n<p>So last week, when the State Prosecutor’s Office alleged that Dean Issacharoff, spokesman of the soldiers’ anti-occupation group Breaking the Silence, had lied about his actions, Israeli right-wing leaders naturally rejoiced.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; To whitewash occupation, Netanyahu crew casts Breaking the Silence whistle-blower as bogeyman | Opinion</p> \n<p>The findings, they claimed, were further evidence of what they have been saying for years – that Breaking the Silence is an organization of liars and traitors bent on defaming the State of Israel and the Israeli army.</p> \n<p>As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a Facebook post: “Breaking the Silence lies and slanders our soldiers around the world. Today this fact received further proof, if anyone had a doubt. The truth wins out.”</p> \n<p>But in the latest twist in a case that has gripped the nation in recent days, Netanyahu’s declaration of victory appears to be premature.</p> \n<p>According to brand new evidence, the state prosecutors who pronounced Issacharoff a liar may have been investigating the wrong incident and questioning the wrong victim.</p> \n<p>Newly unearthed footage, broadcast on two of Israel’s most popular evening news programs Monday, suggests that the Palestinian whom Issacharoff claims to have assaulted was not the same Palestinian questioned by state investigators.</p> \n<p>It also appears that the Palestinian questioned by state investigators, the one who testified that Issacharoff had not assaulted him, had been referring to a completely different incident.</p> \n<p>In the clip, filmed three-and-a-half years ago by a Hebron resident employed by another Israeli human rights organization,&nbsp;Issacharoff is seen escorting a handcuffed Palestinian who appears to have bruises on his face. How he received the bruises and the circumstances of his arrest are not clear from the footage.</p> \n<p>An account published Tuesday morning in Haaretz by Amira Hass raises further questions about the credibility of the state prosecutors’ findings. In his first interview since the findings were published, Hassan Joulani, the Palestinian questioned by investigators about the incident, said that contrary to what state prosecutors reported, he had indeed been assaulted during his arrest – although by Border Police and not by Issacharoff.</p> \n<p>The blows, he said, were received during a separate incident – not the one cited by Issacharoff in the videotaped account that prompted the investigation.</p> \n<p>Joulani was arrested and beaten, according to this interview with him, in February 2014, during a demonstration marking the 20th anniversary of the mass murder of Palestinians at Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs by settler Baruch Goldstein.</p> \n<p>The assault reported by Issacharoff, however, took place after a routine round of stone-throwing.</p> \n<p>On one level, it boils down to the simple question of whether or not a former Israeli soldier lied.</p> \n<p>On a whole other level, however, the case of Issacharoff raises more fundamental questions about Israel’s 50-year-old occupation and its corrosive effects on society, among them: Who is to blame when soldiers serving among a hostile population in occupied territory act badly – the soldiers or the state that sent them there? Should Israeli soldiers speak out about the atrocities they witness during their service at the risk of tarnishing the image of the state? Can an investigation launched by a right-wing politician who harbors hostility toward anti-occupation organizations – in this case, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked – really be undertaken with neutrality?</p> \n<p>The investigation was launched after a video surfaced several months ago of Issacharoff talking about his experiences as a soldier in Hebron.</p> \n<p>During his service as an officer in the Nahal Brigade, Issacharoff revealed, he had brutally beaten up an unarmed Palestinian who was resisting arrest. Jumping on the opportunity to disgrace Breaking the Silence, several right-wing organizations approached the Justice Ministry demanding a probe. If the spokesman of Breaking the Silence had acted in violation of military law, they said, then he should the pay the price.</p> \n<p>About a month later, Reservists on Duty, an organization bent on discrediting Breaking the Silence, published a video aimed at undermining Issacharoff’s credibility. In the video, his former commander and members of his platoon call him a liar.</p> \n<p>But neither that video, nor the investigation conducted by the State Prosecutor’s Office, included testimony from a key witness.</p> \n<p>Disturbed by accusations leveled at his former comrade, Ruben Silverstone, an eyewitness to the event Issacharoff had testified about, published a video on Thursday corroborating the Breaking the Silence spokesman’s account.</p> \n<p>“On that day we were part of a security force dealing with the riots,” he said on the video. “We did arrest an individual, and Dean did knee that individual in order to arrest him. Those are facts. This is not a lie, and I just wanted to set that straight.”</p> \n<p>Frequent target of smear campaigns</p> \n<p>Established in 2004, during the second Palestinian uprising, Breaking the Silence collects testimonies from soldiers about alleged human rights violations witnessed while serving in the occupied territories.</p> \n<p>Most of the soldiers who provide such first-hand accounts request anonymity. The organization asserts, however, that it meets with each and every one of them and corroborates all the accounts it receives before publishing them.</p> \n<p>Breaking the Silence has been targeted in numerous right-wing smear campaigns, and the current government has gone so far as to introduce legislation that would deny it funding.</p> \n<p>The organization receives a large share of its funding from European governments and donors. According to its 2016 financial reports, its single largest donor is the New Israel Fund (New York), but other major donors include the International Human Rights and Law Secretariat (Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Netherlands), Misereor (Germany), Delegation of the European Union to Israel, Sigrid Rausing Trust (United Kingdom), Foundation for Pro-Victimus (Switzerland), the Swiss Foreign Ministry, Broederlijk Delen (Belgium), the Spanish Agency for International Development Coordination, and the Rockerfeller Brothers Fund (New York).</p> \n<p>Common complaints heard about the organization are that it publishes anonymous testimonies and badmouths the army abroad.</p> \n<p>In their defense, Breaking the Silence representatives maintain they have nothing against the Israeli army, but only against the occupation, and that in the digital era, it is impossible to prevent foreign individuals and organizations from accessing the sort of testimonies they collect.</p> \n<p>Last April, Netanyahu canceled a meeting with German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel after the latter held a meeting with representatives of Breaking the Silence while on a trip to Israel.</p> \n<p>The German angle to the story doesn’t end there. Jeremy Issacharoff, father of the former combat soldier at the center of the storm, is Israel’s newly appointed ambassador to Berlin. In recent days, Israeli right-wingers have been waging a campaign on social media to get him ousted. His crime: guilt by association.</p> \n<p>In a letter dispatched Monday, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely (who, in the current absence of a foreign minister, is the ministry’s senior political figure) urged all Israeli diplomats in Europe, Issacharoff senior included, to speak out against Breaking the Silence and pressure government officials in the countries where they are stationed to stop funding the organization because of the lies, she says, it spreads.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday morning, however, Hotovely clarified in a tweet that she rejects the calls to oust the ambassador just because of his son’s involvement in Breaking the Silence. “Jeremy is an excellent ambassador,” she wrote. “I am personally acquainted with his major contribution to the Israeli Foreign Service, and the struggle against Breaking the Silence will continue.”</p> \n<p>The army and Justice Ministry have tried to go after Breaking the Silence activists in the past, but this is the first time a representative of the organization has been singled out in such a way.</p> \n<p>Following the latest TV disclosures, six Israeli lawmakers, all representing parties on the left, issued a call on Tuesday to investigate how the state prosecutors reached their conclusions.</p> \n<p>“The decision to launch an investigation (against Issacharoff), after hundreds of testimonies about violence perpetrated by other soldiers have never been probed, raises suspicions that this was a political act,” they wrote in their request, “and that the State Prosecutor’s Office operated on the basis of ulterior motives.”</p> \n<p>The State Prosecutor’s Office issued the following response: “We are not familiar with the videos broadcast this evening. If someone believes that an act of violence took place at another time, that person can submit his claims to the relevant authorities.”</p> \n<p>Its response did not address the new claims made by Joulani in his interview with Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Avner Gvaryahu, executive director of Breaking the Silence, said, “Our first and most important mission now is to prove that the whole process was politicized.”</p> \n<p>“Once the entire picture is clear,” he added, “it will be clear as daylight that what happened here, in the best-case scenario, was pure negligence and an attempt to please a senior politician, and in the worst-case scenario, a bid to persecute soldiers who oppose the occupation.”</p> \n<p>If Gvaryahu is ultimately proven right, the latest attempt to break Breaking the Silence could backfire, big time.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Have a good time” just doesn’t cut it when you see Nick Cave live. That’s a given. His concerts are never bad, and the show at Tel Aviv’s Menora Mivtachim Arena on Sunday night was almost unbearably good.</p> \n<p>How good? Song after song, a paradoxical sensation arose anew. On “From Her to Eternity,” which just grew and grew and grew. You wanted it to never end – but then it did and another song, “Tupelo,” began – and you had the same feeling all over again. And again with “Jubilee Street,” and so on.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Nick Cave: BDS is the reason for my trip to Israel &gt;&gt;</p> \n<p>The show was built around two solid platforms: one musical – Nick Cave the singer, Nick Cave the writer, and Nick Cave and his superb band, the Bad Seeds. The other touched on a performatory, emotional and communal level.</p> \n<p>Cave has always been an expressive performer, someone who forges a direct emotional bond with his audience. But what happened Sunday night defied the usual definitions of a concert. This was more like a ritual, a mass act of worship, which was especially notable at the beginning.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, it grated at first. The combination of the audience’s instant hero worship of Cave and what seemed like his obsession with physically touching everyone in the audience was simply too much. He ran from one side of the stage to the other, interacting with everyone, obeying some inner demon seemingly goading him to overdo it. The music couldn’t counteract it. The songs from his latest album, “Skeleton Tree,” sounded rather weak, sluggish and lukewarm. They lacked the desired combination of hot and cold, proximity and distance. Everything was all too close, just wrong somehow.</p> \n<p>And then everything changed. It started in the middle of “Higgs Boson Blues,” and exploded in an almost frightening way in its intensity in the aforementioned “From Her to Eternity.” As Cave songs go, this was one of his hits from the 1980s – and we know what hits from the ’80s usually sound like at this large sporting arena. What happened Sunday night was the exact opposite. A metaphorical saw of noise shook the stage, accompanied by a whip that cracked again and again. You never knew where it would land next.</p> \n<p>The next 20 minutes, during which he performed “Tupelo” and “Jubilee Street,” were equally tremendous. Cave’s desire to touch us all erupted in these minutes, too, taking him, among other places, to the very back rows of the balcony. But now with the musical perfection on stage, he had absolute artistic backing.</p> \n<p>Things mellowed somewhat with “The Ship Song” and “Into My Arms.” But just when you thought the concert was heading in the usual “greatest hits” direction, Cave and his band wondrously performed some more songs from “Skeleton Tree”, which sounded 10 times better than the other new songs at the start of the show.</p> \n<p>First and foremost was “Girl in Amber,” which for me was the real tearjerker of the evening. Cave sings it beautifully, the accompanying black and white video of a woman slowly growing more distant is gorgeous, while the wonder of the Bad Seeds’ backing vocals was simply ineffable. Operating a saw? Cracking a whip? Yes, but angels too.</p> \n<p>And then Cave did something that will live long in the memory. He approached the audience, but this time was not looking for hands. He didn’t hug, touch or embrace, yet in a moment of beauty, somehow embodied love. He stood among the crowd, yet remained apart from it. His soft voice was almost pleading, against the background of his angelic accompaniment: Don’t touch me.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In March 2016, Israeli Transportation Minister Israel Katz proudly proclaimed that the new airport near Eilat, named after the late astronaut Ilan Ramon, would be ready in a little more than a year.</p> \n<p>The year has long since passed and work on the airport is still going on. The Israel Airports Authority says it expects the facility to finally open sometime in 2018, but declines to be more specific about the date. Industry sources believe it will be towards the end of next year.</p> \n<p>Ramon Airport is designed to ferry tourists in and out of the southern resort town of Eilat, which is now served by a tiny municipal airport as well as by Ovda Air Base. Once dismissed as a white elephant in the making, Ramon is now regarded as a financially viable project as Eilat tourism has enjoyed a big revival.</p> \n<p>Thanks to a Tourism Ministry initiative to subsidize airlines flying in tourists from Europe, some 128,000 visitors flew to Eilat last year. This winter tourism season should see 55 flights arriving in Eilat every week.</p> \n<p>The bulk of the delays in completing construction of the Ramon Airport, which began four-and-a-half years ago and is budegted at 1.7 billion shekels ($480 million) stems from changes in security requirements, most of them arising out of the trauma of Operation Protective Edge.</p> \n<p>During the 2014 war, a Hamas rocket crashed close to Ben-Gurion International Airport, causing the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority to bar American carriers from landing there for close to two days. Foreign airlines followed suit.</p> \n<p>Israeli officials realized that without Ben-Gurion, the country’s main international gateway, Israel had no international airport that could serve as a substitute in an emergency. As a result, Katz ordered changes to the airport’s original plans. Runways were extended to a length of 3.6 kilometers, 500 meters more than planned, to accommodate all types of aircraft, even jumbo jets. He also doubled the airport’s capacity for parking planes to 60.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, Ramon Airport has special security needs of its own. The final protocol for the airport will only be completed in February, sources said. The facility in the southern Arava Valley, located close to the Jordanian border, presents especially challenging security requirements. One such requirement is a perimeter fence, which will be tens of meters high when completed.</p> \n<p>Ramon faces other possible delays. It needs an international operating license, which will take several months to get. There’s also a lengthy trial period as the IAA learns to synchronize that airport’s multiple systems, ranging from baggage claim to trash collection. One malfunctioning system could delay the opening date.</p> \n<p>In addition, the city of Eilat is threatening to block the opening if improvements aren’t made to Route 90, the road linking Ramon to the city.</p> \n<p>“It would never occur to me that hundreds of flights would be landing at the new airport, in which they’ve invested so much, but that the road out of it would be jammed with traffic. Some of the best airports in the world have failed because there was no access to the city it served,” said Mayor Yitzhak Halevi.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israel Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich has said he won’t give his approval to open the airport if there is not adequate police presence. That means housing a permanent police station at an annual cost of 18 million shekels, an outlay no government body so far has agreed to pick up. The fire service is making similar demands.</p> \n<p>Officials don’t express concern about the delays. The Ben-Gurion 2000 project, which was supposed to give Israel a completely new terminal and other facilities in time for the millennium, wasn’t completed until 2004.</p> \n<p>“Whatever the delays, the fact is construction of the airport is being completed in record time under difficult conditions,” said one official, who declined to be identified. “Even if there’s a delay of a few months, it’s no disaster. Is there any national project in the State of Israel that was competed in time? That’s the way it is with big projects.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tomer Persico quoted remarks that MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) made recently at a conference of religious Zionists, where he presented his plan to offer the Palestinians three options: leave the territories, continue to live there with second-class status, or continue resisting, in which case “the Israel Defense Forces will know what to do.” These are chilling words that are liable to lead Israel into committing the horrific crime of genocide.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to believe that an elected representative of a party in the governing coalition could raise the option of genocide if the Palestinians don’t accept the terms he’s willing to offer them: either emigration, or life under an apartheid regime based on principles of Jewish law, which would be even worse than the one that existed in South Africa. Smotrich, a deputy speaker of the Knesset, is the most senior government figure to date to say unabashedly that the option of genocide is on the table if the Palestinians don’t agree to our terms – and it’s clear they won’t agree.</p> \n<p>Smotrich relies on the biblical Book of Joshua as his model. Researchers of genocide in the ancient world have already determined that the Book of Joshua is an important document for examining the characteristics of genocide in the ancient world. Some of its components differed from the genocides of the 20th century, but the Book of Joshua describes actions that were explicitly defined as genocide in the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The convention defines anyone who commits such acts as someone who committed crimes against humanity and must therefore be put on trial.</p> \n<p>This is how the Book of Joshua describes the conquest of the city of Ai (Joshua 8:24-29): “And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, even in the wilderness wherein they pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all Israel returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. ... So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation, unto this day. And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the eventide; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his carcass down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap of stones, unto this day.”</p> \n<p>The 1995 massacre in Srebrenica, an atrocity slightly less terrible than the biblical one, was defined as genocide by the United Nations. Article 2 of the genocide convention states that “genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.” These acts include “killing members of the group”; “causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group”; “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”; and “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.”</p> \n<p>Had the conquest of Ai taken place today, Joshua bin Nun would have been brought to court in handcuffs and tried on charges of genocide. And that’s Smotrich’s model.</p> \n<p>Article 3 of the convention states that punishable actions related to genocide include genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, “direct and public incitement to commit genocide” and “complicity in genocide.” It would be interesting to hear what an expert in international law would say about Smotrich’s remarks.</p> \n<p>Smotrich’s admiration for the biblical genocidaire Joshua bin Nun leads him to adopt values that resemble those of the German SS. Naturally, he didn’t take the trouble to make such comparisons, since someone who supports genocide doesn’t try to understand the worldview of the genocidaires who preceded him.</p> \n<p>From God's mouth to Himmler's ears</p> \n<p>This is how God explains to Joshua why Israel was defeated in one of its battles against the enemy (Joshua 7:11-12): “Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff. Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.”</p> \n<p>Or in other words, conquest and annihilation must be carried out according to precise instructions from God. When Israel violates these instructions by seizing property and looting without permission, they are punished.</p> \n<p>The similarity between the biblical text and what Heinrich Himmler said to senior SS officers in Poznan in October 1943 is chilling. Here is what Himmler said: “I am referring here to the evacuation of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people. ... The wealth they possessed we took from them. I gave a strict order ... that this wealth will of course be turned over to the Reich in its entirety. We have taken none of it for ourselves. Individuals who have erred will be punished in accordance with the order given by me at the start, threatening that anyone who takes as much as a single Mark of this money is a dead man.”</p> \n<p>In every genocide, the supreme authority insists on order and discipline from those responsible for carrying it out, in accordance with criteria which he sets. Members of the SS were convinced they were men of integrity, with clean hands, who didn’t loot their victims’ property. Does Smotrich believe the ethics of the Book of Joshua could serve as an example for how the Palestinians should be treated today?</p> \n<p>Smotrich has a reputation as a racist and a homophobe. Now it turns out that he also potentially supports mass murder. In any enlightened society, one can find people like this in dubious pubs, in Munich or Mississippi, that are frequented by skinheads tattooed with swastikas. But in Israel, the person saying this is a representative of the state.</p> \n<p>One obviously can’t expect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do anything about this. But the real danger to Israel comes from the hundreds of Knesset members and public figures from other parties – including Likud, Yesh Atid and even Zionist Union – who understand quite well where Smotrich and his colleagues in the Habayit Hayehudi party are dragging the state, but are afraid to stand up, form a united front with the Israeli left and tell the public the truth: Smotrichism, like Hitlerism, Stalinism and Maoism before them, is an ideology that leads to the perpetration of genocide.</p> \n<p>If those who understand this don’t rise up and eliminate this danger now, this will be the tragic end of the Palestinian people. But it will also be the end of the vision of a sovereign Jewish existence in Israel.</p> \n<p>Prof. Blatman is a historian of the Holocaust and genocide at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A somber spirit is haunting the Israeli left. Many ask, “Where did we go wrong?” For some, doubt is creeping in: maybe they are right? We saw a yearning at the recent memorial ceremony marking the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin – let us unite. But what exactly do they want to unite for?</p> \n<p>While the vast majority of Israeli citizens understand the occupation is leading us to destruction yet prefer to look away, and while the gaps in Israeli society are ever widening – the rich are getting richer, the poor get poorer – we on the left mostly debate the question of who’s to blame and not what we should be doing. We don’t ask how we can break the cycle of “There’s nothing to do,” because it’s a daunting and paralyzing question. Instead, it is easier to ask who is guilty.</p> \n<p>But “Who is guilty?” is a question about the past. We suggest working toward the future by taking one small, yet transformative, step.</p> \n<p>What can we do when it seems there’s nothing to be done? First, act based on what’s in our power to change. We suggest establishing a Jewish-Arab political slate that will run jointly for the Knesset and serve as the basis for the establishment of an Arab-Jewish party.</p> \n<p>This should be a mission that left-wing parties Meretz and Hadash must lead jointly, initially with their hundreds of thousands of voters and later with the growing circles of the desperate.</p> \n<p>Both parties are divided over the historical question: who’s to blame? They have different answers based on Zionist and non-Zionist degrees. They also have different positions in the heated discourse about Britain’s deeds 100 years ago – mainly regarding the question of whether Israel (and most of the Arab countries around it) was born in the sin of British imperialism. Only a person with a zealot’s fire burning inside of him would make a past sinner flagellating himself a condition for working together politically. The present convergence into ghettos of narratives as a substitute for political action is a disaster. Identities are hugely important, but identity politics is a dubious issue that isn’t concerned about the future, but rather, a poisonous settling of accounts with the past.</p> \n<p>We propose exchanging the narratives into plans of action and political organization. The purpose of organizing is to obtain political power through democratic means for fundamental change in two areas.</p> \n<p>First, changing the current situation of the occupation, and its present and future fatal metastasis. Let us stress: Stopping the occupation is the most important thing. It was Hadash, in one of its previous incarnations, that had the slogan “Israel Palestine – two states for two peoples,” which Meretz adopted many years ago. This will be the guiding principle of the joint slate, which means, among other things, opposition to “one state” – which has a high chance of becoming an apartheid state, or launching a bloody civil war, similar to the one in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Second, the slate’s platform will be a social-democratic one. It will be based mainly on demands that were supported by the public during the social justice protests of 2011. In other words, caring for every Israeli citizen and fighting against any discrimination based on nationalism, ethnicity, religion, gender and geography, while being for full civil equality – legislative, political, social and economic. Everyone will enjoy a social safety net in the fields of housing, health, education and welfare.</p> \n<p>We do not ignore the fact that establishing a Jewish-Arab slate is a difficult task for the two parties we are appealing to. Each has a hard time going beyond its comfort zone. However, consolidating Jewish-Arab forces in Israel justifies the taking of electoral risks. Moreover, the present comfort zones are liable to turn out to be illusory if either of the parties disappears from the Knesset in the next election after failing to reach the electoral threshold.</p> \n<p>It is true that Labor Party Chairman Avi Gabbay recently joined Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid in his dismissive attitude toward Arab citizens of Israel – thus ceding electoral space to Meretz. And true, today Hadash looks like its place is secure with the Arab public. Still, it is possible that both parties are at a dead-end, both in terms of their way forward and political power. Therefore, party wisdom, and not only moral responsibility, dictates joining forces. The two parties have a large pool of at least 350,000 voters (based on the number of Meretz voters and Hadash’s share of the Joint List in the 2015 election). These people can be seen as a powerful potential for change.</p> \n<p>A Jewish-Arab slate could lead to a historic turnaround in the long run. This prospect obliges the leaders of both parties and their supporters to seriously consider the question of what they can do – together.</p> \n<p>Prof. Itzhak Galnoor is the former head of the Civil Service Commission and Prof. Avishai Margalit is an Israel Prize laureate in philosophy</p>",

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;A year ago, the world changed overnight. The election of Donald Trump did something to us all. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu did not publicly welcome the news with hand-rubbing glee. Behind the scenes, though, it freed something in the prime minister.</p> \n<p>And that something wasn't good.</p> \n<p>The election emboldened Netanyahu. Not only the triumph of a Sheldon Adelson-backed Republican but also the defeat of three political forces Netanyahu viewed as likely ruts and potholes in his chosen path - the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, and, by extension, the leader Netanyahu most loved to hate, Barack Obama.</p> \n<p>The election also elevated to front-row, what-they-say-goes prominence the one group in the world which has retained an apostle-grade adoration of Netanyahu - the one of four Americans who identify as evangelical Christians.</p> \n<p>Taking his cue from Trump's nativist base, the election freed Netanyahu to cater to the winds of populism, Jewish supremacism, fundamentalist politics and dog-whistle racism within his own far-right coalition. Their demands – more settlement, a strengthened Orthodox monopoly, less equality for non-Jews, deportation of migrants – would not play well in the world. Which is music to Netanyahu's ears. What hurts Israel in the long run only helps him in the short run.</p> \n<p>Since last November 8, the prime minister's moves to slight and betray and infuriate the world Jewish community, to effectively annex the West Bank, and to undermine the already severely compromised values of the rule of law and of democracy and equality in Israel have set the nation and the Jewish world on a progressively more dangerous path.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu may well have seen himself as having won along with Trump last November. But the Israel of its own declaration of independence, and the relationship which Israel long prized with the Jews of the wider world, lost big.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, nothing has harmed Israel worse than the measures over which the prime minister himself has presided. Nothing, that is, carried out by Iran, Hamas, ISIS, or for that matter, by the BDS movement or as a result of the findings of Israel Police detectives investigating Benjamin and Sara Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>In the short span of Trump's taking power, Netanyahu has shattered a 70-year-long relationship with North American Jewry, a bond long seen as one of Israel's primary strategic assets. The prime minister has ignored the counsel of top Israeli security and diplomatic officials, in order to side with Trump on such issues as undermining the Iran nuclear deal and keeping mum on a surge of anti-Semitism over the past year.</p> \n<p>Here, then, are seven of the most harmful anti-Israel milestones of the year since Donald Trump's election:</p> \n<p>7. Netanyahu reinvents himself as Trump Part I -&nbsp;Netanyahu exalts Trump's wall, and enacts his own version of travel ban.</p> \n<p>In late 2015, Netanyahu had joined world leaders in condemning then-candidate Trump's vow to institute a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Trump subsequently canceled a planned trip to Israel, later stating that Netanyahu's criticism had been &quot;inappropriate.&quot;</p> \n<p>But by January of this year, as his entire 22-strong cabinet refused all requests to comment on now-President Trump's contentious executive order suspending refugee arrivals and barring visas for travelers&nbsp;from against seven Muslim-majority countries, Netanyahu tweeted:</p> \n<p>“President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.”</p> \n<p>By March, Netanyahu had enacted a&nbsp;new travel ban&nbsp;of his own. The ban specified denying entry to Israel of individual members of organizations and individuals who, the government deemed, advocated a boycott of Israel.</p> \n<p>6. Netanyahu reinvents himself as Trump Part II -&nbsp;Dismisses as &quot;Fake News&quot; all allegations of wrongdoing, while impugning and stonewalling senior government investigators and prosecutors – further cementing his bond with the Republican Party and mega-donor Sheldon Adelson – and further alienating and angering Democrats, who include the vast majority of U.S. Jews.</p> \n<p>&quot;In the Mueller probe and the incessant probes against Netanyahu we see the new face of the Left,&quot; hard right ideologue Caroline Glick wrote&nbsp;last week in a twinned defense of both Trump and Netanyahu. &quot;Unable to win elections, they exploit their control over the bureaucracy and media to overturn election results.</p> \n<p>&quot;There can be no greater threat to the health of a liberal democracy than that.&quot;</p> \n<p>5. &nbsp;Netanyahu, ignoring his own defense establishment and key allies, urges Trump to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.</p> \n<p>Despite widespread sentiment among senior security officials that Iran was continuing to comply with the terms of the agreement, and support for the deal among Israel's key allies in Europe, the prime minister took to the rostrum of the UN General Assembly in September to blast the deal, urging world powers to &quot;fix it or nix it.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;If President Donald Trump moves to scuttle the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, Israel's nationalist government can be expected to be the loudest — and perhaps only — major player to applaud,&quot; the Associated Press reported.</p> \n<p>However, it continued, &quot;There is a strong sense among [Netanyahu's] own security establishment that there are few good alternatives, that the deal has benefited Israel, and that U.S. credibility could be squandered in the turbulent Middle East in ways that could harm Israel itself.&quot;</p> \n<p>4. Netanyahu files for divorce from American Jewry by reneging pacts over Western Wall and conversion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>How bad is the rift? Last month, Netanyahu considered staying away altogether&nbsp;from the annual convention of the Jewish Federations of North America, reportedly for fear of being heckled and booed by resentful delegates. The Reform Movement, meanwhile, has announced that it will reject all bids to meet with Netanyahu or his office until a concrete offer for solving the Western Wall crisis is put on the table.</p> \n<p>And if that were not enough, as Trump courted the alt-right, he did next to nothing to acknowledge and counter a wave of anti-Semitism, and suggested that there were fine people among the marchers who accompanied Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting &quot;the Jews will not replace us,&quot; Netanyahu, the man with the sterling silver tongue, was silent.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>3. Netanyahu nods to majority supremacism, vowing to suppress and deport migrants and working to enact a bill which relegates Arab citizens to second class status and may sap the rights of women, LGBTQ people, non-Orthodox Jews and others.</p> \n<p>With less fear of opposition from a White House pursuing similar directions, Netanyahu is set on finally passing a Jewish Nation-State Bill. The draft text&nbsp;includes a provision stating that &quot;the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.&quot; It also demotes Arabic from its present status as an official language of Israel to an undefined &quot;special status.&quot;</p> \n<p>2. Effective annexation of West Bank, accompanied by intensive efforts to foil talks with Palestinians&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This was a year in which the government sought legislative and other means to legalize outposts and settlements which in the past even Israel had declared illegal. It was a year in which officials from Netanyahu on down boasted of how Hebron, Ariel, and other settlement centers were part and parcel of Israel. It was a year in which Netanyahu ruled out any Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, as well as any uprooting of settlers, legal or otherwise. And it was a year in which Netanyahu added no less than seven new and likely impossible preconditions&nbsp;for the resumption of&nbsp; talks with the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>1. Cutting electric power to the Gaza Strip</p> \n<p>All but forgotten in the welter of regional tensions and wars of words, was a Netanyahu government decision to accede to a request by the Palestinian Authority – then engaged in a power struggle with Hamas – to cut Israeli-supplied electric power to the Gaza Strip&nbsp;to a maximum of three hours and 15 minutes over every 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The government did so at the height of the heat of the Gaza summer, during the sunrise-to-sundown fast of Ramadan, with hospital wards and drinking-water desalination plants already closed down for lack of power, and with raw sewage running in the streets and between houses.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prof. Elie Podeh discussed the Palestinian and Arab refusal to accept the UN Partition Plan of November 29, 1947 in his article (“Their biggest missed opportunity,” Opinion, November 30), and even provided a long list of other Palestinian missed opportunities – all of which have led the Palestinian national movement to its nadir of today. Even if Abba Eban’s statement “The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity” is too much of a generalization, it is still worth going back and reflecting on it these days.</p> \n<p>It is clear that the Palestinians were disappointed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and that he will move the U.S. Embassy there. But the official Palestinian response reflects once again a number of failures that have led to politically catastrophic decisions.</p> \n<p>While the Israelis are celebrating, justifiably, over Trump’s decision, it is impossible to ignore that his speech included statements that without a doubt displease the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump said explicitly that recognizing Jerusalem and moving the embassy do not in any way determine the borders and the United States supports the two-state solution – if it is acceptable to both sides.</p> \n<p>The Palestinian response ignored these two statements, which in practice say that as far as the final agreement is concerned, the Trump administration’s stance is not significantly different than the position of previous American administrations. Without a doubt, they were included in Trump’s announcement to soften Arab opposition, especially that of Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>A responsible Palestinian leadership that strives to reach an agreed upon solution and does not make do with aggressive rhetoric could have seized on these statements. Only the Palestinian unwillingness to understand that if a solution is found, it will realistically have to be a compromise formula and not the fulfillment of all their demands, prevented the Palestinian leadership from relating to these aspects of Trump’s speech, which were actually quite opportune for them.</p> \n<p>One could have expected a different response from the Palestinian leadership, if only it was attentive to claims other than its own. It could have praised Trump for mentioning for the first time – yes, the first time – the two-state solution and expressing his support for it. Moreover, from the Palestinians’ perspective it was also possible to applaud the statement that the recognition and moving of the embassy did not mean the determination of borders. They could have interpreted this as American willingness to accept the division of Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>They could even have added that in such a case, Jerusalem could be the capital of two countries, Israel and Palestine, and the Palestinians would happily promote the establishment of an American embassy in their state in East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Instead, the Palestinian leadership attacked the United States and its president, declared that America cannot be an honest broker, threatened to boycott the visit to the region by Vice President Mike Pence, and announced that Trump’s speech irreversibly buried the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>Every rookie diplomat and politician knows that the first thing that must be done in response to the statements of an external body is to emphasize those aspects that are convenient for you and only afterward disagree with what is unacceptable. The Palestinians did exactly the opposite, and in doing so bolstered the Israeli achievement.</p> \n<p>This response, which joined a long list of historic missed Palestinian opportunities, was not the result of stupidity or a lack of experience. It seems its roots can be found in the inability to live with compromise, which characterizes the Arab political discourse in general.</p> \n<p>The absolute faith in its own righteousness is what prevented the Arab world from accepting the UN Partition Plan in 1947, and it is what prevented Yasser Arafat from accepting Anwar Sadat’s pleas to join him on his visit to Jerusalem and his speech to the Knesset. One can only imagine how history would be different if Arafat, too, had come to the Knesset in November 1977.</p> \n<p>Zionism’s moral legitimacy is encapsulated in Chaim Weizmann’s canonical statement that the conflict isn’t between justice and injustice, but between two parties which both have justified claims, and therefore compromise is the only possible fair solution.</p> \n<p>The Palestinians sometimes claim that they have already made their compromise, and the proof of this is their willingness to accept the 1967 lines. But this, of course, is a deception: The 1967 lines weren’t the result of a Palestinian willingness to compromise, but of the failure of their attempt to prevent implementation of the partition plan. It’s just like the Israeli claim that Israel’s compromises should be limited to its concession of the land on the other side of the Jordan River. That, too, is arrant nonsense, because this wasn’t a Zionist concession, but the result of Britain’s decision not to apply the Balfour Declaration’s principles, which were incorporated into the Mandate for Palestine, to the other side of the Jordan.</p> \n<p>Concessions are made in the here and now, over something you actually possess. That is what Israel needs to do; hence the debate within Israeli society. And that’s also what the Palestinians will need to do if and when it becomes possible to reach an agreement, one in which both sides will consent to difficult compromises.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This unwillingness to make compromises also explains Arab societies’ failure to develop democratic systems of government, which are based entirely on compromise, on the understanding that there is more than one legitimate opinion and that people who think differently than you must be respected. In the Arab political conversation, anyone who disagrees with you is too often considered a traitor or a foreign agent or part of a conspiracy. This makes it hard to accept a multiparty system or a compromise between two national movements. The Palestinians are demanding that Israel give up control over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, but they insist that their demands be accepted in full (including their demand for a “right of return”). This doesn’t bode well for the future of the negotiations, and the uncompromising Palestinian response to Trump’s announcement also does nothing to advance a historic compromise between the two national movements.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel has paid 227 million shekels ($64 million) in compensation for terror attacks to people affected by a large outbreak of fires in November 2016, despite there being no proof any of the arsons were driven by political motives.</p> \n<p>The money came from a fund held by property tax authorities, usually used only in cases of people affected by war or acts of terror, even though in some cases it was determined that the fire was caused by negligence.</p> \n<p>Haaretz has learned that the state has filed only five indictments related to the 2016 fires, in no case claiming that the arson was driven by political motives.</p> \n<p>In a response to queries by Haaretz to the Tax Authority, it emerged that to date, 99 percent of the 2,762 claims have been settled. On average, claimants received 80,000 shekels ($22,500). According to Tax Authority figures, most of the claims, 2,321, were made in the Haifa area. Another 225 were made in Tel Aviv, 191 in Jerusalem and 25 in Tiberias. In response to a question filed by MK Yousef Jabareen (Joint List), the treasury replied that 52 claims were denied.</p> \n<p>As a rule, compensation for damage caused by hostile acts is given only after an investigation by security forces determines that the damage was caused by war or an act of terror. In any other instance, when property is damaged by fire and the owner is uninsured, there is no compensation, unless the damaged party proves in court that the state was negligent.</p> \n<p>The state has paid compensation in the past in cases in which property damage was unrelated to war or hostile acts. After the enormous Carmel fire in 2010 the state compensated people whose houses had burned down and who had no insurance. But the number of cases was small then, and the funds did not come from property tax coffers.</p> \n<p>The Justice Ministry responded recently to a question by Jabareen regarding the labeling of many of the fires as hostile acts even though there was no evidence for this. The ministry said, “The determination did not link the conditions required for granting compensation and the existence of parallel criminal proceedings. This was due to the difficulty in obtaining evidence in these cases, where many perpetrators were not brought to justice. Setting a high bar would counter the intention of the law.”</p> \n<p>Subsequently, the Justice Ministry claimed that it directed the question to the Tax Authority, which stated that its decision regarding some of the fires was based on information received from the security forces. After thorough investigation, the Tax Authority determined that for compensation purposes the string of fires were part of a wave of arson incidents which was probably planned. Haaretz has learned that even in fires that were clearly not caused by arson, compensation was paid as if these were acts of terror. One example was a fire at Beit Meir near Jerusalem, which caused heavy damage to houses, warehouses, chicken coops and gardens. The fire was caused by a flare fired by a policewoman who had received warnings of unauthorized workers hiding in the village. Due to the dry conditions prevailing at the time, the flare ignited a fire that spread rapidly.</p> \n<p>The dozens of fires that broke out in November 2016 caused heavy damage to property, requiring the evacuation of thousands of residents. As events were unfolding, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister for Public Security Gilad Erdan and other cabinet members pronounced it a wave of arson and terror acts, an “arson intifada.” A month later a report by firefighting services determined that most of the fires had been set deliberately. However, other than in a small number of cases, little evidence for this was produced.</p> \n<p>Jabareen said that “declarations by the prime minister and members of his cabinet created an atmosphere of hostility and hatred towards the Arab public in Israel.” He added that “apparently it was convenient for all concerned to classify the fires as hostile acts, even when there was no proof of this.”</p> \n<p>Of the five indictments, one was filed in a military court in the territories against three suspects from the village of Deir Abu Mashal. They were accused of setting a fire that spread to the settlement of Halamish, causing serious damage there.</p> \n<p>The other four indictments were filed in Israel. In one case a resident of Umm al-Fahm was charged for lighting a pile of trash near his house. Another was filed against three residents of Deir Hanna, who were accused of setting a fire near their town. Another case was filed against two youths, with the judge noting that this was probably a prank. In another case two residents of Umm al-Fahm were convicted. One of them was a minor. They were sentenced to 24 and 20 months in prison after being found guilty of setting a fire near Mei-Ami for no reason. The attorney who represented the minor said he took full responsibility for his actions. “It was a prank with no serious motive,” he said. “If this was a nationalist-motivated crime the sentence would have been harsher.”</p> \n<p>The Tax Authority stated that in some of the cases there was evidence for arson or attempted arson. “Information in these cases was transferred to the Authority by security and firefighting services. According to the circumstances in these cases, it was determined that these were hostile acts. This was true in some cases in Haifa and Zichron Yaakov, as well as in other locations, allowing compensation to be given according to property tax laws. In Beit Meir the fire was caused by security forces operating against arsonists, which enabled the fire to be labeled as a hostile act which is eligible for compensation.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel’s shot at sending an unmanned spacecraft to the moon may be doomed after billionaire businessman Morris Kahn resigned as chairman of SpaceIL on Monday.</p> \n<p>According to the company’s managing director, Kahn’s departure after a year and a half on the job is based on the sense that although he had donated to the venture personally, his financial status was actually an obstacle to tapping other potential investors. “The situation in which the organization chairman was a donor himself got in the way of the fundraising process,” SpaceIL CEO Eran Privman told TheMarker.</p> \n<p>SpaceIL&nbsp;is a nonprofit organization founded in 2010 to participate in a Google contest, promising $20 million to the first group that landed an unmanned spacecraft on the moon. Kahn had been involved in the venture from the get-go and over the years donated $18.5 million to the cause. Altogether SpaceIL raised $55 million.</p> \n<p>In fact Kahn’s resignation is just the last phase in attrition at SpaceIL. Fourteen senior people have left – quit or were fired – not a few of them engineers and managers who, like Kahn, had been involved from the beginning.</p> \n<p>Almost there ...</p> \n<p>The SpaceIL project is headed by Privman, who tells TheMarker that Kahn left because of the nonprofit’s financial state. Namely, it needs $30 million to finish building the spaceship and move onto the next stage.</p> \n<p>It would just take three more weeks to finish building the spaceship and install its electronics, Privman says, after which it would undergo testing in conditions emulating outer space and the moon itself, to make sure the thing works.</p> \n<p>Basically, Kahn and management agreed that his role as chairman was detrimental to the fundraising effort, Privman explains. Kahn agreed to personally hand over another $10 million, if the organization could raise $20 million from others; now they hope that with him gone, they will find it easier to tap the state and private donors as well.</p> \n<p>They still hope to launch in 2018, but given that this is a competition, they won’t reveal the scheduled launch date, Privman says.</p> \n<p>However, if they can’t raise the $30 million, they can’t finish creating the spaceship and the project will collapse.</p> \n<p>“The challenge is a tough one and it’s legitimate for people to leave,” acknowledges Yanki Margalit, a technology entrepreneur who had been chairman of the venture from its establishment before stepping down a year and a half ago and being replaced by Kahn. “The dream among the people on the first day had been childish – to create a spaceship that would land on the moon within two years. Over the years, the project matured, and it took more time and money than anybody had expected. Kahn made a massive contribution to the project, which wouldn’t have gotten as far as it did without him. I hope people will be found to take it forward. I understand why he grew weary. The government isn’t part of it, it’s piggybacking.</p> \n<p>“This is hard work and it’s no coincidence that only three nations have landed crafts on the moon so far,” Margalit continues. “If we become the fourth country to land on the moon, it will all have been worth it.”</p> \n<p>Unrealistic goals</p> \n<p>When Google kicked off the competition in 2010, one of the conditions was that the spacecraft lift off by 2014. Nobody made it and the company extended the deadline, a few times. Now the deadline is the end of March 2018, but that too could be put off.</p> \n<p>Participants must be non-government entities (such as privately owned companies) that build and launch the craft into space, successfully land it on the moon, move it 500 meters along the lunar surface and get it to broadcast a video to Earth. Israel is contending against four other groups, from the U.S., Japan, India and an international group involving Brazil, Croatia, the U.S., India, Malaysia, the U.K. and Australia.</p> \n<p>Among SpaceIL’s donors, aside from Kahn, who donated about a third of its money, are an Adelson&nbsp;family foundation, the businessman Sami Sagol, the Israel Space Agency (which belongs to the Ministry of Science) and the Weizmann Institute. Although a privately-initiated nonprofit, SpaceIL could be seen as a national endeavor. It presently has 50 employees – as well as 200 volunteers talking about the project in schools throughout Israel.</p> \n<p>Assuming a spacecraft gets finished, it is supposed to be launched by SpaceX, though there may be some difficulty around the deadline, which was set at December 2017. That launch contract might yet fall through.</p>",

Not even close.</p> \n<p>The Jewish mourning day of Tisha B'Av came early this year.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The date marks two tragic occasions in the past during which the Jewish people effectively lost the Holy Land.

Because this year, in an explosion of legalized, governmentally weaponized Sinat Hinam,&nbsp; it marks the week that this country, as we have known it, effectively ended as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>-&nbsp;On Sunday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu publicly promised Israel's LGBTQ community - among them his own voters and a Likud lawmaker - that he supports surrogacy rights to same-sex couples.&nbsp;Two days later, with religious and Russian-immigrant-supported politicians opposing the measure, Netanyahu led his coalition in voting to kill the bill.</p> \n<p>Sinat Hinam.</p> \n<p>- Also&nbsp;on Sunday, security services at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport's departures area&nbsp;took aside and interrogated&nbsp;at length and with pronounced incredulity a prominent Jewish-American philanthropist who chairs Brandeis University's Board of Trustees, is Orthodox, and has close family in the settlement city of Maaleh Adumim.

In its place, directives that veer Israel towards genuine apartheid, including a downgrading of the status of the Arabic language and therefore of Arab citizens of Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The wording of the law, though diluted down from an outright endorsement of Jim Crow-type housing segregation, retains an element of implied&nbsp;support for what are commonly Jews-only communities.</p> \n<p>Sinat Hinam.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>- Soon after&nbsp;on Thursday, in a pre-dawn raid, police rousted out of bed and&nbsp;detained a Conservative rabbi in Haifa&nbsp;under a law forbidding officiating at weddings outside the government's Orthodox Rabbinate. The law carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sinat Hinam.</p> \n<p>- Still later&nbsp;on Thursday, in a direct slap in the face of Hungarian-born Israeli survivors of the Holocaust and of the anti-Semitism-besieged Jewish community of Hungary, Netanyahu hosted a&nbsp;love-fest welcome&nbsp;for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who based his recent re-election campaign on dog-whistle encouragement of Jew-hatred.</p> \n<p>And Tisha B'Av doesn't even start until&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;night.</p> \n<p>And, this beginning this year, it may go on indefinitely.</p> \n<p>This is what Netanyahu's new Israel feels like.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Israelis woke up to a country in which Netanyahu's hand-picked goon squad - politicians who mock and shout down bereaved parents, politicians who mock and denigrate disabled colleagues - posed grinning with him for a victory selfie after effectively repealing Israel's Declaration of Independence, passing the single most gratuitously hateful legislation in the nation's history.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This, then, is Netanyahu's legacy: He has&nbsp;taken the Israel of the Start Up Nation and turned it into the Israel of the Shithole Nation State.</p> \n<p>Call it irony or call it inevitability,&nbsp; this man who has spent every waking minute of the last decade warning Israelis about the dangers of the Iran of the ayatollahs and the Revolutionary Guard, also spent that same time turning Israel into the Iran of the Rabbinate and the rogue settler.</p> \n<p>Back when&nbsp; he was called King Bibi, back when he was lip-servicing peace, back when he had an overwhelming Knesset majority and American backing for far-reaching diplomacy, for enhanced democracy and equality in Israel, he could have done anything he damn well chose to do. His legacy was his to create.</p> \n<p>His legacy could have been coexistence, flexibility, humanity, respect, diplomacy, 21st century education for all, a good life for all people who share this land.</p> \n<p>After all these years, Benjamin Netanyahu's legacy is finally clear, clear enough to be summed up in two words:</p> \n<p>Sinat Hinam.</p>",
