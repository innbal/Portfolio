        "text":["<p>The European Union issued a new declaration on Thursday regarding its fight against anti-Semitism, adopting a softer tone than the one originally proposed by Austria, which was promoted over the past few months by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu had requested that the EU adopt the working definition of anti-Semitism issued by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental organization that was founded 20 years ago.</p> \n<p>This definition states that some criticism of Israel could be anti-Semitic, such as: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor,” or by applying double standards to Israel not demanded of any other nation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some EU countries, however, were concerned that this definition could prevent criticism of Israel's policy in the Palestinian territories. A compromise was therefore reached and the final statement calls on member states to use the IHRA definition as a “guidance tool,” without making it obligatory.</p> \n<p>The statement was issued by the European Commission in Brussels and approved by the forum of EU justice and interior ministers. It calls on EU members and the European Commission to take steps “to guarantee their safety and well-being” of Jewish communities and “take concrete steps to better protect the Jewish community in Europe and to continue their fight against anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>The declaration also notes the importance of education about and remembrance of the Holocaust, along with a recommendation to adopt the IHRA definition.</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;IHRA definition&nbsp;- which was adopted in 2016 by Germany, the United Kingdom&nbsp;and five others in the European Union -&nbsp;was central to a controversy involving allegations of anti-Semitism against U.K Labor leader&nbsp;Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;when the party refused to adopt the IHRA definition, opting instead for a diluted version. It has&nbsp;since adopted&nbsp;the full IHRA wording.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even though the IHRA definition is not legally binding, it serves as an international guideline of what anti-Semitism is, and has declaratory and symbolic importance as a definition to be used by law enforcement officials and in education and training all over the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to the IHRA definition: “Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews.”</p> \n<p>One of the examples given by the IHRA of anti-Semitism states: “Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity.”</p> \n<p>“Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis,” is given as another example of anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Characterizing Israel or Israelis “using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism (e.g., claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel)” is another example of anti-Semitism according the IHRA.</p> \n<p>But at the same time, “criticism of Israel similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.”</p> \n<p>Other expressions of anti-Semitism, according to the IHRA, include accusing Jews living outside of Israel of being more loyal to Israel, “or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interests of their own nations.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This also includes: “Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel,” and “calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion.”</p> \n<p>Holocaust denial is also an example: “Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust,” along with: “Denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust).”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as collective - such as, especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions,” is another example of anti-Semitism, according to the IHRA definition.</p> \n<p>The IHRA definition has been adopted by many countries, including Israel, Britain, Austria, Romania, Germany, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Macedonia. But its adoption by the EU would have much greater importance in making it an international standard.</p> \n<p>Austria, which holds the rotating EU presidency during the second half of 2018, promoted the adoption of the declaration fighting anti-Semitism, with the encouragement of Netanyahu, who spoke with Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz on the matter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel and Austria have cooperated on the issue, despite the Israeli government’s boycott of Kurz’s coalition partner, the populist right-wing Freedom Party, which Austria’s Jewish community has accused of not renouncing its anti-Semitic past. Many of its present members still use anti-Semitic and Nazi symbols and expressions.</p> \n<p>For some time now the Israeli government has been promoting a policy in which anti-Zionism is recognized “the new anti-Semitism” – as Netanyahu has said many times.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>As part of this policy, the Strategic Affairs Ministry, which is charged with combatting what Israel calls the international campaign to “delegitimize” it – led by the BDS movement – regularly accuses groups boycotting Israel or the settlements of intentional and systematic anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>For example, after Airbnb announced it would remove rooms for rent in the settlements form its website, Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan said the company had caved in to “the anti-Semitic BDS groups.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At a conference Erdan recently attended in Germany, the minister said Europe needs to fight BDS in exactly the same fashion it needs to fight classic anti-Semitism, and called BDS advocate, singer Roger Waters, an anti-Semite.</p> \n<p>On November 21, an international conference was held in Vienna that focused on combatting anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, entitled: “Europe Beyond Anti-Semitism and Anti-Zionism - Securing Jewish Life in Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu sent a video statement to the conference in which he was heard saying: &quot;Since the establishment of the State of Israel, we face a new form of anti-Semitism, vicious efforts to demonize the Jewish State and deny the Jewish people the right to self-determination in our ancestral homeland, the Land of Israel — whereas every other nation is allowed to define its flag, its national anthem, its national identity, except for the Jewish people. This is anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu also added that &quot;the first step to combat anti-Semitism is to define it.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;The Israeli government,&quot; the premier continued, along with seven other European governments, including Austria, has adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. I urge all countries to adopt this definition and to increase their efforts to combat anti-Semitism and its modern manifestation, anti-Zionism. There is only one remedy for slander, and that is the truth.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu made the same comparison a week later while addressing the Knesset plenum during the visit of the Czech president in Israel. He drew the comparison again during an interview with CNN a day later, in which he responded to a poll that showed a surge in anti-Semitism in countries he has been working to bolster ties with in recent years: Austria and Hungary. In his interview Netanyahu defended the Austrian chancellor and claimed that he was battling anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>The frequent use of the term &quot;anti-Semitism&quot; by the Netanyahu government, including controversial cases involving fierce critics of Israel or the settlements, without drawing a distinction between the two, have made adopting of the IHRA definition a highly contentious political issue.</p> \n<p>EU states critical of Israel policy in the West Bank were concerned such a move would help silence censuring and thus refrained from fully adopting the definition.</p>",

When the others sang an opening hymn, his mouth did not move. When the others read the Apostles’ Creed, he stood stoically. And when one eulogist after another testified to George H.W. Bush’s integrity and character and honesty and bravery and compassion, Trump sat and listened, often with his lips pursed and his arms crossed over his chest.&quot; [WashPost;&nbsp;CNN]  —&nbsp;George H. W. Bush’s Funeral Was the Corny, Feel-Good Moment That Washington Craves — by Susan Glasser:&nbsp;&quot;What does it tell you that the feel-good events in Washington these days are funerals? George Herbert Walker Bush was memorialized... in the country’s first state funeral of the Trump era, one of those American rituals that, at least for a few hours, is supposed to remind the country that civility is not a dirty word and that partisan combat is not a permanent state of being... Trump had to sit there knowing that every statement praising Bush’s decency and modesty and courage would be taken as an implicit rebuke of him—of course, many of them were a lot more explicit than implicit.&quot; [NewYorker]  DRIVING THE DAY&nbsp;— President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will host leaders and members of the American Jewish&nbsp;community at two separate Hanukkah receptions to be held at the&nbsp;White House's East Room at 4:00 PM [CSPAN] and 8:00 PM [CSPAN]. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend both events.&nbsp;  THE DRIVE TO SCORE HANUKKAH PARTY INVITES —&nbsp;&nbsp;At one of the first White House Hanukkah parties during George W. Bush’s presidency, senior strategist Karl Rove quipped to Jeff Ballabon, a Bush campaign advisor, “If ten percent of the people in this room would have worked ten percent as hard to get the president elected as they did to get invited to this party, we would have had 90 percent of the Jewish vote.”  Tevi Troy, who served in the Bush White House, recalls:&nbsp;“When I worked in the White House, there were people who wanted to get there because they needed to show that they were the first level of importance and they were in the in-crowd.”  Motivations vary:&nbsp;For GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the taste of latkes from the White House kitchen were enough to convince him to donate millions to support GOP nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. For others, simply being seen in the room with leading political figures and donors can be interpreted as a measure of one’s standing in the Jewish community.  Tradition:&nbsp;Ever since President George W. Bush began the tradition of hosting an annual menorah-lighting ceremony in the White House, the event has served as a rare convergence of disparate Jewish leaders representing groups from across the wider political and religious spectrums.  Invitees feel a “sense of validation of their role and prominence in the community,” Obama Jewish liaison Matt Nosanchuk told Jewish Insider. “It’s both the feeling they get being in the White House, and the feeling that they’re there, that they’re in, and not on the outside. So it became a very highly sought-after ticket.”  But what happens when the President himself is a self-described outsider?&nbsp;Under President Trump, a proudly anti-establishment leader who relishes breaking DC norms and conventions, and who is equally unloved by the political establishment, some say the buzz surrounding White House Hanukkah party is different. [JewishInsider]  According to one Jewish leader planning to attend who asked not to be identified:&nbsp;“There are certain members of the Jewish communal establishment who would have gone to George W. Bush's Hanukkah party but will not come to Trump's because he's so much more radioactive.”  Jarrod Bernstein, an Obama White House Jewish Liaison:&nbsp;“I think that with this president, everybody needs to make their own decision about how much they want to be complicit in him and his agenda. I think that there are a lot of people who just might not feel comfortable about attending because everything this president touches is controversial.”  Noam Neusner, a Bush Jewish liaison and speechwriter:&nbsp;“Every administration is controversial in its time. I think that if people are invited to the Trump Hanukkah party they should go, and if they don’t want to go because they disagree with his policies then they should decline. That’s it. It’s not a terribly complex formula. It’s exciting to be invited to the White House. Even in an administration with which you disagree, it’s an honor and it’s quite a scene.”  WILL DEMS SHOW UP? —&nbsp;For President Trump’s first Hanukkah party, the White House did not invite any Democratic members of Congress. This year, all Jewish members of Congress, which includes 28 Democrats, were invited, according to the White House and confirmed by Congressional aides.  At least one member, Rep. Jerry Nadler, has told Jewish Insider that he will not attend the East Room event, citing a scheduling conflict.  Ann Lewis, a former White House Communications Director under Bill Clinton:&nbsp;“I think Democrats should be invited to such events during GOP administration, and Republicans to Democratic White Houses. Holding bipartisan, inclusive events is good for the Jewish community. Would I go? Maybe. If the president had just said something morally offensive, I might not. But my goal would be to honor the Jewish community and my country, not one individual.”  Halie Soifer, Executive Director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America:&nbsp;“I thought last year’s decision to not invite Democratic members of Congress, especially when the overwhelming majority of Jews in Congress are Democrats, was extremely short-sighted. This year, members of Congress were invited but I don’t think members of the Jewish community at large who are Democrats were invited.”  Jeff Ballabon, who now serves as an advisor to the Donald Trump re-election campaign:&nbsp;“I find the hypocrisy truly hysterical. This administration started and the so-called mainstream establishment announced that they were going to boycott the president,” Ballabon recalled, referring to the decision made by rabbinical and religious groups representing the Reform, Conservative, and Reconstructionist movements to discontinue the tradition of participating in a pre-High Holidays conference call with Trump in 2017. “They have been maligning the president since the campaign, using the worst kind of libel and lies, and I would be appalled to see any one of these individuals in the room.”  — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will light the 5th Hanukkah candle&nbsp;alongside U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman at the Western Wall this evening.&nbsp;  ON THE HILL —&nbsp;Congress looks to usurp Trump’s foreign policy powers — by Nahal Toosi and Marianne Levine:&nbsp;&quot;The Senate is on the verge of an extraordinary rebuke of Donald Trump’s foreign policy, underscoring a bipartisan willingness to encroach on the president’s powers as commander in chief... The fury is so great on Capitol Hill over the Saudi murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi — and the Trump administration’s tepid response — that senators are deliberating over whether to pull U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen.&quot;&nbsp;[Politico]&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate introduces bipartisan resolution condemning Saudi crown prince [Axios]  TALK OF THE REGION — In the Middle East, Russia is back&nbsp;— by&nbsp;Liz Sly:&nbsp;&quot;Among the presidents, prime ministers, kings and princes who have visited Moscow over the past year to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin are some of the United States’ closest allies...&nbsp;There’s a new power rising in the Middle East, and it needs to be wooed... Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called Trump a&nbsp;“true friend” of Israel, has spoken 11 times on the phone with Putin over the past year and only three times with Trump, according to a tally of the calls reported on Putin and Netanyahu’s websites. Netanyahu has visited Moscow four times in the past year. He’s visited Washington twice since Trump became president.&quot; [WashPost]  In Muscat, PM told Omani leader he’s ready to cede land but not security control&nbsp;— by Adam Rasgon:&nbsp;&quot;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Omani leader Sultan Qaboos bin Said that he is ready to cede territory, but not security control, to the Palestinians, a senior official in Ramallah briefed on the prime minister’s comments said.&quot; [ToI]  Tal Shalev&nbsp;reports:&nbsp;&quot;Qatar demanded a formal and public Israeli statement of support recognizing efforts to rehabilitate Gaza as a condition for transferring the next round of funds to the Gaza Strip.

Israeli officials told me the nationalist right-wing Hungarian government led by Viktor Orb&aacute;n wants to use the museum to whitewash any involvement of the Hungarian state or the Hungarian people in Nazi crimes during World War II... Two of Orb&aacute;n's advisers arrive in Israel and will meet on Thursday with Netanyahu's diplomatic adviser Reuven Azar... Netanyahu's office didn't invite any representative from the foreign ministry to take part in the talks, and there is real concern in the foreign ministry that Netanyahu will make the same compromises he made with the Polish Holocaust bill.&quot; [Axios]  Bari Weiss tweets:&nbsp;&quot;What are the implications of an Israeli foreign policy that embraces leaders like Trump, Orban and Duterte? Among other things, you get news items like this from Barak Ravid: Holocaust revisionism in Hungary enabled by Bibi's government.&quot;&nbsp;  BUZZ ON BALFOUR&nbsp;—&nbsp;Suspected of Crimes, Netanyahu Is Also Suspected of Fear-Mongering — by&nbsp;Isabel Kershner:&nbsp;&quot;On television, radio and social networks, many Israelis wondered if the [Hezbollah] tunnels disclosure was a cynical ploy akin to the 1997 black comedy&nbsp;“Wag the Dog,”&nbsp;in which a political candidate invents a war to distract from his personal predicament. While Mr. Netanyahu hasn’t exactly done that, critics said he appeared to be pumping the serendipitous military action against the tunnels for all it was worth... While acknowledging the importance of destroying tunnels, detractors immediately ascribed dubious political motives to the timing of the action and decried the drumbeating and media hype of what they said was basically a defensive engineering project on Israeli soil.&quot; [NYTimes]&nbsp;  AT THE UN —&nbsp;UN Expected to Pass First-ever anti-Hamas Resolution — by Amir Tibon:&nbsp;&quot;The UN General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on two resolutions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which are both expected to pass. The first resolution includes a condemnation of Hamas for its terror activities, and if it passes, it will be the first time that&nbsp;Hamas&nbsp;is condemned by name in a UN resolution. The second resolution... pushed by the&nbsp;Palestinian Authority. It includes condemnation of Israeli settlements and a reference to the parameters of a future peace agreement.&quot; [Haaretz]&nbsp;  Differing BDS Definitions —&nbsp;J Street along with Jewish American progressive groups sent a letter&nbsp;yesterday to Israel's Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan criticizing his call on U.S. governors&nbsp;to open an investigation into Airbnb's removal of listings in Israeli West Bank settlements.&nbsp;  J Street's Jeremy Ben-Ami tells us...&nbsp;&quot;The biggest problem with Israel's response is that here's a company that continues to do business in the State of Israel. It has thousands and thousands of listings in the State of Israel. It has thousands and thousands of listings of Jews around the world. It is neither anti-Semitic nor anti-Israeli. The problem with the government's response is the conflation of those who are truly anti-Semitic with those who are opposed to the policy of the government of Israel. And those two are not equivalent, and it is a big mistake of the government of Israel. But I would add also of the American Jewish establishment. When we put the two in the same bucket, when we say that those who are opposed to the occupation, who are opposed to settlement extension, are somehow anti-Semitic, that's a very big mistake.&quot;  2020 WATCH&nbsp;—&nbsp;Michael Bloomberg prepared to sell namesake firm for presidential run — by&nbsp;Brittany De Lea:&nbsp;&quot;During an interview with&nbsp;Iowa Radio on Tuesday, Bloomberg said if he decides to run for president, he would either sell the Bloomberg media company or place it in a blind trust.&nbsp;“But I think at my age, if selling it is possible, I would do that,” he said. “At some point, you’re going to die anyway, so you want to do it before then.&quot; [FoxBusiness]  Deval Patrick passes on 2020 run, citing 'cruelty' of elections process — by&nbsp;Devan Cole:&nbsp;&quot;Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick will not run for President in 2020, he announced on Thursday, citing the &quot;cruelty of our elections process&quot; and the effect it would have on those close to him.&quot; [CNN]&nbsp;  LONG READ — Cory Booker on the campaign trail in New Hampshire — by Adam Rubenstein:&nbsp;&quot;Jeffrey Goldberg once wrote that there’s “a high degree of certainty that Booker knows more Torah than” anyone else in the Senate. Booker says that Judaic thought has contributed deeply to his worldview. It helps him communicate in terms of “goodness, kindness, decency to another” and “justice.” Yiddishisms and Jewish liturgy dot his speeches. At [a] Dartmouth College [townhall in October], he mistakes the day of the week. It’s Sunday, but he thinks it’s Saturday. After being corrected, he announces, “Okay, so it is not Shabbat, but I’d like to give a little d’var Torah anyway,” he says.&quot;  &quot;He launches into a discourse on Abraham’s openness as represented by inviting strangers to his tent. It is one of Booker’s go-to stories...&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a compelling and practiced patter—and surely a strong asset in engaging one of the country’s most vocal and generous group of supporters—but it seems to confuse his audience of college progressives. “Is Cory Booker Jewish?” I overhear one undergrad asking another.&quot; [WeeklyStandard]</p> \n<p>** Good Thursday&nbsp;Morning!

Haim went home to debrief with Cheryl. “She goes, ‘We’re doing this,’” he recalled. “I knew right there and then we were doing this... I love saying, ‘Yes, dear’ to my wife.’” (The donation ended up being $50 million.) Haim has no regrets, especially when because the building also reminds him of his late mother, who he said always insisted on going shopping at the May Company when she would visit Los Angeles from Israel... Haim also quipped, “Ted, I’m sorry I said no to you and yes to Bob, but Bob bought my company for $5.2 billion.” [Variety]  Spielberg, 25 years after 'Schindler's List,' warns against collective hate — by&nbsp;Alexa Keyes:&nbsp;&quot;In the wake of the&nbsp;mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue&nbsp;in October, acclaimed Hollywood director Steven Spielberg believes now, more than ever, is when people must&nbsp;confront the alarming rise&nbsp;in hateful ideologies. Spielberg's Academy Award-winning film about the Holocaust, &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; is returning to select theaters this week in honor of its 25th anniversary... &quot;We have to take it more seriously today than I think we have had to take it in a generation,&quot; he said...&nbsp;For a man who is no stranger to &quot;best-of&quot; lists, Spielberg still ranks &quot;Schindler’s List&quot; as one of the most personal films he has ever made.&quot; [NBCNews]  ‘Asher’ Review: An Aging Hit Man Finds Love — by&nbsp;Glenn Kenny:&nbsp;&quot;Not too long into “Asher,” directed by&nbsp;Michael Caton-Jones&nbsp;and featuring Ron Perlman in the title hit man role, the hired killer has something that might be a heart attack while on the job...

        "text":["<p>Picture a long-haired man in S&amp;M-style leather underpants, his hirsute chest bursting through a white shirt with dangling buttons, and wearing women’s gloves, one hand waving an ornate lace fan. The man is dancing in a glistening white bathtub that stands in a luxurious, palatial room, while around him two other, no-less extravagantly dressed people dance and sing. One is a woman in a puffed-up, especially loud and revealing white dress, an artificial rose thrusting out of her panties, and exuding provocative sexuality; the other is a man attired in a flaming-red suit of the type sported by 18th-century European noblemen. Together they resemble nothing so much as three distant cousins of Marie Antoinette who have embarked on a singularly mad celebration of flagrant sexuality and gender fluidity, with nary a thought about the guillotine that awaits those who flaunt the consensus.</p> \n<p>We’re watching the video clip of “Crucified,” the first big hit of Army of Lovers. Released in 1991, it turned the almost esoteric Swedish pop group into an international sensation. With dance-able music, evocative texts relating to holiness, redemption, Christianity and Jerusalem, too, and a colorful camp look drenched in sexuality and flamboyance, the clip became a huge hit in Europe – one of the biggest-selling singles that year on the Continent – then crossed the Atlantic to scorch the dance floors in the United States and land in a slot high up on the hit parade.</p> \n<p>Army of Lovers became a tremendous success: a mix of kitsch, queerness and sensuality fused with elaborate production values in both live performances and clips. A series of pulsating disco-Eurodance hits followed, laced with plenty of self-humor. The world took the band to its heart, and the threesome continued to thumb their nose at religion, acclaim sexual liberation and occasionally mention Israel. The group went on international tours; limos and private planes became part of their routine. Along with ABBA, Roxette and Ace of Base, Army of Lovers became one of the most famous bands ever to emerge from Sweden and leave an international imprint.</p> \n<p>Nearly 30 years after that first hit, the film “Army of Lovers in the Holy Land,” was screened in the documentary competition at the recent Haifa International Film Festival, offering a refreshing, merry and notably pleasurable change of pace amid the films about significant topics, interesting but unutterably depressing, that Israeli reality provides nonstop. The panel of judges awarded the film, directed by Asaf Galay, its prize for best Israeli documentary, and a man in sharp leather boots with heels – whether they were thinner or higher, it was hard to determine – was there to leap on the stage with joy.</p> \n<p>Two weeks later, the same man, Jean-Pierre Barda, emerges from his small Tel Aviv apartment for an interview with Haaretz. Yes, one of the members of Army of Lovers has lived in Israel for the past three years, enjoying relative anonymity. In Sweden, he’s famous and readily recognized, accustomed to the looks and furtive whispers he gets from passersby on the street, but in Tel Aviv he’s just another oleh hadash – a new immigrant – no more.</p> \n<p>Barda, 53, is pleased with this new phase in his life. He likes the anonymity, likes living in this country and doesn’t for a moment regret his decision “to make aliyah.” After three years, he feels quite at home. “When I was an oleh hadash, the most common question I encountered was, ‘Why?’” he says with a smile.</p> \n<p>“But it’s so obvious, isn’t it?” he says. “And then I explain that I wanted a change to a less stressful life, and they almost always ask, ‘So you came here?!’ But actually, there is a big difference between here and Sweden. Because if I had tried to do it in Sweden – to step off the treadmill – it would have been impossible. The whole system grabs you there and doesn’t let you disconnect. But here, parallel to the crazy fast lane, there’s a slow lane. Even in Tel Aviv, you have the beach, the yoga, the grass [i.e., marijuana]. It’s the total opposite of my life in Sweden. Here I feel relaxed, here I’m a lot less famous, I don’t feel like people are looking at me all the time. Sitting with you here in a caf&eacute;, for example, I don’t have to think about whether people are listening to us or not.”</p> \n<p>Jean-Pierre Barda was born in Paris in 1965, the eldest of three children. His father, who was from a religious Jewish Algerian family, was a barber and later a waiter and a ma&icirc;tre d’, and his mother a homemaker. When he was 7, the family moved to Stockholm. Judaism played a central role in his life, he tells me. They weren’t religiously observant, didn’t pray every day, but he and his siblings attended a Jewish school where they learned Hebrew and imbibed Judaism. At age 12, he joined a group from the religiously observant Bnei Akiva youth movement on a visit to Israel, where they and their rabbi did the usual tour of holy places.</p> \n<p>Already then, Barda had begun to realize that being straight was not his thing. It was equally clear to him that his father would not accept his homosexuality with understanding.</p> \n<p>Barda: “I knew that religion played an important role in his life. And besides that, whenever my father noticed something about me that wasn’t masculine or anything like that, he would tell me, ‘Stand straight,’ ‘Behave like a man.’ So I knew where he stood on those matters.” He adds, “It’s a generational thing. It’s not that he wanted to be cruel to me – he just couldn’t handle it.”</p> \n<p>Things came to a head when Jean-Pierre was 16. The family went on vacation to Paris, and a girl who was a good friend of Barda’s and whom his parents were certain was his girlfriend, visited them there. He lived with her in a studio apartment that belonged to his parents, who resided in another nearby studio apartment. One evening, when Barda was on a hot date with a boy, his parents invited the girl for dinner.</p> \n<p>“They started to ask her questions about where I was,” Barda recalls. “She of course knew I was gay and was on a date, and finally said to them, ‘It’s not for me to answer these questions. You have to ask him yourself.’”</p> \n<p>When he got back, he saw his parents standing in the window of their apartment, waiting for him. “I saw them there and I thought, ‘Uh oh, something’s really wrong here.’ On the way up the stairs I ran into my father, and I turned and ran. He chased me and we had it out on the street. In the end, I slept with the guy I’d gone out with that evening. And the next day, when I got home, my things were already packed and I was on the way back to Sweden. After that I didn’t talk to my parents for almost 15 years.”</p> \n<p>Barda studied humanities in high school and was certain he’d become an artist, actor or fashion designer, but a job he got as a makeup person landed him in that profession. He worked as a makeup and hairstyling artist in magazine and television productions, gained a reputation in the field, and in the mid-1980s was invited to do the makeup for “Barbie,” a drag show with Alexander Bard that was a hit in Stockholm at the time.</p> \n<p>“It was the same genre as Divine,” Barda explains, referring to the stage name of the late drag queen. “Alexander was on the stage in drag, not as a beautiful woman but as an avant-garde cross-dresser. His name was Barbie, he was the secret child of Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy, the CIA sent him to Mars when he was a baby and that’s where he grew up.”</p> \n<p>Bard invited Barda and a model named Camilla Henemark (“La Camilla”) to appear with him onstage as backup singers. Within a short time the three decided to drop the act and to form a band, which they called Army of Lovers. For Barda, the band was a new home, replacing the one he’d been kicked out of at 16.</p> \n<p>Sleeping with the enemy</p> \n<p>There’s an interesting internal contradiction in the name “Army of Lovers,” Barda says at one point in the new documentary. On the one hand there’s the word “army,” which is associated with war, and on the other, “lovers.” Fellow band member Dominika Peczynski (who followed Michaela Dornonville de la Cour, who replaced La Camilla) rolls her eyes at him and comments that he’s obsessed with sleeping with everyone. But Barda says insistently: Maybe that’s the solution, simply to sleep with the enemy. Bard, the third member of the band, who’s sitting next to them on a sofa, leaps up and says that all this is “very Army of Lovers.” Yes, he continues, we’ll sleep with them all. If that will solve anything, they’ll show up immediately. They will be “the sex workers of the world.”</p> \n<p>Quick cut to a live performance by the band, in which Barda, in a red dress, vinyl boots and heavy makeup, sings an amazingly exaggerated, melodramatic solo, while Bard and Peczynski take advantage of a gilded royal couch behind him to simulate an act of passionate intercourse before the eyes of thousands of amused onlookers in the audience.</p> \n<p>In the film, the three make the point that they are not professional musicians, but amateurs. Bard relates that he decided to establish a band that would be so charismatic that it would make no difference whether its members could sing or dance, and Peczynski sums it up by saying that they may not know how to sing, but they’re really good at wearing high heels.</p> \n<p>Indeed, even if they are not virtuoso singers, they knew a few things about a magnetic stage posture, sophisticated design, flaunting the conventions and, above all, fun. Lots of fun. In an era when MTV dictated the developments in the music industry, the elaborately bizarre, irreverent and just plain funny clips of Army of Lovers did the job. Their songs, notably “Sexual Revolution,” “Obsession” and, of course, “Crucified,” joined the top 10 in the charts of a host of countries.</p> \n<p>They wrote the songs themselves but didn’t hesitate to draw on the help of professional singers in recording studios so they’d sound better. They also took a lot of flak and scorn for their constant use of playback in concerts. But for the band such put-downs were like dust in the wind, no more.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t important to us if we were singing with playback or without it,” Barda tells me. “The main thing for us was ... for it to be special. For us, the criticism we got for using playback was cultural snobbism, that’s all. Why is playback less good than a live act? We write the material ourselves. We get the ideas ourselves. We are in involved in the whole production, even the videos, including the costumes. It’s our production.”</p> \n<p>Did you come to have a good time, or did you have messages or an agenda you wanted to promote?</p> \n<p>Barda: “At first we didn’t think about messages and things like that. But when you find yourself in the limelight, it somehow comes up by itself. You feel that people are looking at you and you think, ‘Oh, I can say something.’ So along the way we had other motivations than just, ‘Hey, look at me’ or ‘I just wanna have fun.’”</p> \n<p>What did you realize was worth saying?</p> \n<p>“Our message was to take down boundaries. Something very liberal, have sex with everybody all the time. We are all three very liberal, though Dominika and I have our roots in something that is not so liberal – we both grew up in conservative, Jewish families.”</p> \n<p>You started off as part of an avant-garde, humorous drag show, and Army of Lovers also started off with humor and irony. What’s it like to wake up one morning and discover that your fun thing has become a global hit?</p> \n<p>Barda laughs. “We were in our bubble, and because even before success struck we were pretending that we were the greatest band in the world and that we were super-famous already, it was actually pretty natural. But it wasn’t all that sudden. Because right at the start, even before ‘Crucified,’ we had a taste of success with another song, ‘Ride the Bullet.’ That was a small hit on MTV and people like [fashion designer] Jean-Paul Gaultier discovered us through it, and it prepared us a little for the big success we had with ‘Crucified.’”</p> \n<p>But still, success on that scale isn’t something that usually happens. How did you cope with it? What was enjoyable about this story and what was difficult?</p> \n<p>“‘Crucified’ took off so fast we didn’t have time to think. Suddenly we found ourselves traveling on a daily basis to all kinds of places, sometimes three countries in one day. We would do a morning show in Holland, an afternoon show in Belgium and an evening show in Prague. It was very intense. For me personally – not in the beginning, but in the long run – it was fun doing promotions, fun doing TV shows, fun getting dressed and rehearsing. But after a while it got to be a little too much.</p> \n<p>“I felt I was losing contact with my surroundings, with my good friends. It was a kind of empty feeling. Maybe it would have been different if it all happened when we were younger. But each of us already had a life, had a different career outside music, and the success required us to disconnect from the other parts of our lives. It wasn’t easy. For me, for example, it was important to keep in touch with my everyday life by still working in the [hair and makeup] salon where I’d worked before. Sometimes I would go straight from the salon to the airport or vice versa. And coming to the salon was always a relief for me, because there I wasn’t the one in focus – my client is always the focus. So for me it was very therapeutic to keep my day job.”</p> \n<p>Hint of Moshe Dayan</p> \n<p>In 1993, following a string of hits, the band released a new song and was taken aback to discover that it stirred up an extreme furor. This was after Peczynski joined the band, creating a Jewish majority in it. Together, all three wrote “Israelism,” which got the usual Army of Lovers treatment, including a sampling of “Hevenu Shalom Aleichem,” a clip with a variety of figures relating to Judaism and to Israel, and the band’s signature provocative style. Bard played a tart wearing a one-cup bra, in black, an allusion to Moshe Dayan's eye patch; Barda pulled out a gilded dagger that performed a circumcision on Bard; and there were plenty of Israeli flags, Stars of David and Hanukkah menorahs alongside scandalous cleavages, daring garters and sexuality that burst the banks.</p> \n<p>The reactions were swift in coming. In the documentary, we see one of the more amazing responses. It was on Israel Television’s current events program “Popolitika,” featuring a guest who proved that the present culture minister didn’t invent a thing – namely, then-MK Ovadia Eli (Likud), who chaired a Knesset committee aimed at combating anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“Complaints from irate Jewish viewers have reached me,” Eli said, “and in their wake we asked the British broadcasting station [referring to MTV] to examine the complaints. We drew their attention to the fact that the subject offends the sensibilities of Jews in Israel and abroad. [There are] motifs of aggressive sexual activity and in the background national symbols.” The MK did not hesitate to admit that he himself had not viewed the clip. Following a flood of outraged complaints, MTV finally banned the song from broadcast.</p> \n<p>“We never intended to be provocative – it just happened,” Barda tells me. “We thought it would be great to do a song that was a tribute to Jewish culture and to Israel, because we’re all pro-Israel. So we did it in our way, with a lot of humor. If you do a tribute to Israel and write it seriously, it comes out like propaganda, so for us that was the only way to do it. You also have to remember that the genre is pop, so it has to be fun, entertaining. I never thought religious people would get upset over it.”</p> \n<p>Peczynski, too, recalls in a phone conversation that the band was stunned by the hullaballoo.</p> \n<p>“We were quite shocked that those were the reactions we got, we didn’t understand them,” she told me. “Of course it was a different take on religion, any religion, because it has a lot of humor in it, and a lot of cleavage. We worked with what we had. We had two Jewish members in the band, we put on lots of makeup and sexy clothes, and we combined it with a sense of humor. We had fun writing this song. It’s absolutely not derogatory from our point of view. It doesn’t have to be so serious, this religion thing. And of course I understand now that a lot of people thought it was disrespectful, but that was not our intention. Maybe it was an attempt to glamorize [Judaism] a bit.”</p> \n<p>In 1994, after five albums and 20 clips, Barda, Bard and Peczynski felt they had reached the end of the line. Army of Lovers has since done a few reunion shows, and in recent years, the band has hit the road three or four times annually to do invitation performances – including one in the 2017 Tel Aviv Pride Parade – but lately, after immigrating to Israel, Barda has told the others that he’s decided to forsake the Army of Lovers for good. “I’m not saying we’ll never do it again, because never say never, but I want to get on with my life. I’m here in Israel now, exploring a new chapter of my life, and for me it’s mostly a distraction.”</p> \n<p>In the past two decades he’s gone back to working as a makeup artist and hairdresser, appeared as such on a successful TV variety show in Sweden, and in the past decade found himself spending time in Barcelona. “I spent a lot of time there, it’s not so far from Sweden and it’s sunny and it’s by the sea,” he notes. “I met a lot of Israelis at gay parties there, and then I started to reeducate myself, to go back to my original plan from when I was young, to move to Israel.”</p> \n<p>Barda made the move officially in 2015 and works in a salon here, too. In the documentary, when a Swedish journalist interviews him in his Tel Aviv apartment, he’s astonished to discover that Barda has given up a spacious five-room apartment in Stockholm in favor of a modest two-room apartment there. Barda explains that he was happy to get rid of all his stuff, that the downsizing came as a relief. Now, in the caf&eacute; where we’re meeting, Barda – whose Hebrew isn’t bad at all but who still prefers to do the interview in English – explains that it was no problem for him to leave his life behind and move to a different place. The only thing that stressed him out was the realization that his immigration would entail parting from his parents, both of whom are now elderly and ill.</p> \n<p>Did you really feel at home here as soon as you arrived, as you say in the film?</p> \n<p>“From the start it was, wow. I arrived and started going to an ulpan [intensive Hebrew course], and, yeah, wow.”</p> \n<p>And today, three years after arriving, what’s left of that ‘”wow”?</p> \n<p>“I still feel like wow. But I’m feeling like now it’s time to make use of getting better with Hebrew. And actually I think maybe the real fun starts now. At the beginning I spent a lot of time getting to know the neighborhood, discovering the streets. I really love simple everyday stuff.”</p> \n<p>The gold necklace he wears carries a Star of David pendant, and a small gilded hamsa, a palm-shaped amulet, dangles from both of his earrings. “I feel more fulfilled here,” he says. “I mean, like look over there, look at that woman. How cool is she? You never see people her age like that in Sweden. Here you see all ages. In Sweden older people are flipped aside. The further south you go, the more you start to feel that all the generations are involved. It’s like that in Spain, too. But in Scandinavia you don’t have this family bonding, because it’s all taken care of by the state. Here you still have family values. People still take care of each other. Here for example, when I’m sick, my friends bring me food. That never happened in Sweden, never. Not even my family comes to make me food in Sweden. It’s, like, heavy. Here I feel like if I were to die tomorrow, within a week somebody would find out; in Sweden, it would take at least two weeks.” He laughs.</p> \n<p>Do you sometimes miss home?</p> \n<p>“Not at all. It’s scary. I miss friends sometimes, but no more than that.”</p> \n<p>And here in Tel Aviv, do people you meet know Army of Lovers?</p> \n<p>“When they hear the songs they suddenly recognize them. ‘Oh, that song! Oh, is that you?’ They recognize the songs but don’t connect them to Army of Lovers. They’re better known in the LGBT community, and some people there do remixes of the songs.”</p> \n<p>Speaking of community, you morphed from a boy who was forced to hide his sexuality into a pop star who appears around the world in extroverted drag and exudes sexuality. That’s an extreme transition.</p> \n<p>“After I came out of the closet, at age 16, I felt tremendous relief, I just exploded in self-expression. But it was a long and gradual process of liberation, and sometimes I think I’m still in that process – maybe not vis-a-vis my parents, but in terms of conservative people. Even though there is greater acceptance today of the LGBT community, there are still parts of society that don’t accept it, especially right-wing and religious extremists of all faiths.”</p> \n<p>In the film all your interviews were done in full costume. Was that the band’s idea?</p> \n<p>“If we do an interview as Army of Lovers we always do it in full dress.”</p> \n<p>So I’m the only journalist who gets you in a tank top and flip flops?</p> \n<p>“Because it’s the Israeli version,” he laughs. “I’ve changed my life. Now it’s a combination of the flip flops and high heels. But I take every opportunity I get to wear high heels. I love to wear high heels.”</p>",

Gen. Yoel Strick, asked the commander of United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), Maj. Gen. Stefano Del Col, on Thursday to assist in neutralizing an attack tunnel being dug from Lebanon into Israeli territory.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A Hezbollah blitzkrieg: Tunnels on Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Netanyahu visits Lebanon border; 'Iran's entrenchment in Syria has been halted'</p> \n<p>According to an Israeli army statement, Strick demanded UNIFIL reach the tunnel from the Lebanese side of the border, &quot;and noted that whoever enters the underground perimeter endangers his life.&quot;</p> \n<p>The tunnel, which is being dug from the village of Ramyeh in southern Lebanon, crossed into Israel, but does not pose an immediate threat to residents, the statement said.</p> \n<p>Israeli army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, said on Thursday that Strick clarified to Del Col that the Israeli army looks harshly upon the tunnel's digging.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Manelis said Del Col was given a map which shows several structures in Ramyeh &quot;from which we know with certainty that tunnels are being dug towards Israel.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Israeli army statement said that &quot;the responsibility for the well-being of the residents of southern Lebanon living near the underground tunnels penetrating Israel lies with the Lebanese government.&quot;</p> \n<p>The UN force in Lebanon confirmed later Thursday that Israel has identified a second Hezbollah attack tunnel reaching into Israel.</p> \n<p>UNIFIL's Head of Mission Stefano Del Colo confirmed that he visited along with a technical team the spot where the IDF discovered the second tunnel close to the Blue Line. In an official statement, UNIFIL confirmed that &quot;based on the site inspection,&quot; it could indeed say that a tunnel existed at the location.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>UNIFIL also said it was &quot;engaged with the parties to pursue urgent follow-up action&quot; and guaranteed it would pass on its findings &quot;to the appropriate authorities in Lebanon.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later Thursday evening at a ceremony in honor of Mossad operatives receiving citations of excellence that while Hezbollah may be amping up its threats against&nbsp; Israel, the group is not equipped with enough missiles to damage Israel to the extent it wishes to. &quot;According to Hezbollah's plan, they were supposed to be equipped with thousands of missiles today, but they only have dozens,&quot; Netanyahu said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The reason they only have several dozens,&quot; the premier continued, &quot;is actually sitting in this room. It's a combination of the powers of Mossad, the Israel Defense Forces and our entire defense&nbsp;establishment,&quot; he added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Israeli military launched the operation, dubbed Northern Shield, on Monday night. Netanyahu said earlier Tuesday that there had already been &quot;operational successes&quot; in the operation. &quot;Whoever tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that Israel &quot;is operating decisively and responsibly on all fronts simultaneously. We will continue with further actions – public and clandestine – in order to safeguard the security of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Has the Israeli army become the latest prop in Netanyahu's battle for survival? | Analysis ■&nbsp;Attack tunnels from Lebanon: Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Over the past two months, Northern Command and Military Intelligence concluded with a high degree of certainty that they had identified the existence of several attack tunnels below the border fence into Israel.</p> \n<p>At that point, preparations began for the large-scale engineering operation that began Tuesday morning. The General Staff held periodic discussions on the progress of the tunnel-locating venture, which was coordinated by the head of Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Yoel Strick.</p> \n<p>The army said the rocky terrain near the Lebanese border actually made seismic locating technologies more effective than they were in the sandy terrain near the Gaza Strip. These technologies are based on identifying movements in the earth caused by digging. Thus to monitor the digging in this rocky terrain, the army used different methods than it has in the south.</p> \n<p>Northern Command officers predicted that it will take several weeks to locate and destroy all of Hezbollah’s attack tunnels, or in the worst case a little longer. But this assessment is based on an optimistic intelligence assessment – that the army will be able to identity with a high degree of certainly the entire routes of these tunnels.</p> \n<p>Noa Landau contributed to this report.</p>",

        "text":["<p>At his press conference and in other public statements, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been selling the public pompous slogans about his activities, like “the security situation is complex,” “a large-scale campaign that will demand sacrifice” and so forth. But in practice – as revealed by “the affair of Gilat Bennett’s desserts,” first reported by Amit Segal of Israel Television News – when he’s alone with himself (or with his wife), his true desire is to liquidate his political rivals by wallowing unrestrainedly in the mud.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu – who got the United States to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran, was given a royal welcome in Moscow’s Red Square and is applauded in New York, as his wife says, whenever he’s spotted – contacted a tycoon who owns a media outlet to tell tales about Education Minister Naftali Bennett’s wife, who once worked in non-kosher restaurants. This is the political embodiment of a well-known form of bourgeois schizophrenia: The more cultivated and dignified the exterior – after all, Netanyahu presents himself as someone who is “sacrificing himself for Israel” – the worse the interior will be.</p> \n<p>Naftali Bennett – who has refrained from attacking Netanyahu over his numerous criminal investigations, and who announced, together with his party colleague Ayelet Shaked, that he would remain in the government even if Netanyahu is indicted – responded to the prime minister with an unprecedentedly harsh tweet.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Urich, the consigliere du jour at the Prime Minister’s Residence, found support for the information about Gilat Bennett, which was published in Haaretz. And Yair Netanyahu, another success story from the prime minister’s family, accused Bennett of personally giving the devil – aka Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Arnon Mozes – and other journalists negative information about his mother, Sara Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>What are cabinet ministers busy with these days? With pee-pee, doo-doo and gelatin. They’re like a bunch of seventh graders who have exhausted the options for dissing each other and have therefore moved on to cursing each other’s mothers.</p> \n<p>This revelation about Netanyahu comes as no surprise. His hatred for Bennett is long-standing and rock-solid. (Associates of the latter often define the prime minister’s current priorities as follows: 1. Stay out of jail. 2. Remain in power. 3. Destroy Bennett.)</p> \n<p>What is surprising, if anything, is Netanyahu’s assumption that disclosing Bennett’s dubious religiosity would have any kind of effect on right-wing voters. After all, he has before him the example of Shaked, who’s completely secular; yet her electorate identifies with her determined anti-liberalism and admires her cruelty, without delving into the status of her pots and pans.</p> \n<p>What’s new about all this is Bennett’s forceful response. Just a moment ago, he suffered a political defeat at Netanyahu’s hands: After delivering an ultimatum about getting the defense portfolio, he folded.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Bennett was truly furious when he discovered this attempt to attack his wife. (Men who fight for their wives’ honor will be mentioned here only with respect.) But it’s also possible that he’s beginning to catch the faintest whiff of the beginning of Netanyahu’s end.</p> \n<p>Because even though Netanyahu’s base is closing ranks as usual, and even though he has a safe bloc of Knesset seats that will stick with him in the upcoming election – when you take a picture of the future, say five years from now, the image of the old uncle Netanyahu doesn’t come back from the developer.</p> \n<p>Five years. That’s the relevant time period for Bennett and Shaked, who understood back when they tried and failed to add soccer star Eli Ohana to their Knesset ticket that the market value of the shell company they successfully took over – the Habayit Hayehudi party – has a fairly low ceiling.</p> \n<p>Within this time frame – during which their hierarchical relationship may very well flip – it looks like they’ll try to take over Likud and run for prime minister as a team. En route, they’ll bump up against a few people who are no suckers, like Likud’s Gideon Sa’ar and Yisrael Katz, who won’t make way for them easily.</p> \n<p>But what can you do? The road to that goal evidently runs through Gilat’s kitchen.</p>",

The event is called “The Open” and it’s held in Burbank, California, once a year.</p> \n<p>What is West Coast Swing?</p> \n<p>It’s dance that requires attention and attentiveness. I also dance salsa, cha-cha and others, but of all of them, this is the most complex. It’s got lots of technique, of leading and being led, and demands a great deal of attentiveness to the partner. It’s hard to explain to people who don’t dance.</p> \n<p>I guess I don’t get it, but “The Open” sounds like a competition.</p> \n<p>Yes, I competed as part of a group of six couples called K Swing Team, which has been working together for years. We finished second, after a very close battle. But I also had a serious personal accomplishment.</p> \n<p>In the competition?</p> \n<p>No, in the world. I decided I wanted to make a change. Until two years ago, with West Coast Swing, it was impossible to compete by dancing the part of the other partner. Meaning, men lead and women follow, so I, for example, could only lead, even though I enjoy being led more.</p> \n<p>That’s surprising. And two men can’t dance together? Aren’t there any gays in West Coast Swing?</p> \n<p>There are, but not many. The men are mostly straight, and in Israel I can count the number of dancers who are gay on the fingers of one hand. When I started asking men to dance, it was really not accepted; people looked down on men who wanted to be led.</p> \n<p>How did it start?</p> \n<p>Twelve years ago, with salsa dancing. I dance at a high level, I learn fast. I got bored and decided to learn the part of the other side, too. But my coach, who was old-fashioned in her views, refused [to dance the lead]. So I went a bit crazy and started to ask men to dance with me.</p> \n<p>What happens when you ask a man to dance with you?</p> \n<p>Sometimes they refuse. But when they say yes, you can already get a sense of the person after one or two steps, and they realize immediately that I’m a good dancer and the approach changes in a second. I like watching their faces. At first it’s “Fine, okay,” then “Yes!” There’s always that moment of change, of surprise.</p> \n<p>Do most accept or are they afraid?</p> \n<p>I’ll say proudly that today it’s rare for me to be refused, both because I’m recognized and known to be a good dancer, and also because of the hard work I put into persuasion. It used to be insulting when I was refused, but today it makes me laugh. And I also feel that being able to play both parts is not only a matter of ideology, it makes me a far stronger dancer in terms of being in control of the language.</p> \n<p>What language?</p> \n<p>Dance is a language, and if you know both sides, you speak it better. A man who knows how to lead well but doesn’t know how to follow, can’t be a great dancer. Just like in life, a man who doesn’t try to understand a woman from her point of view, to understand what she thinks, will have a problem.</p> \n<p>As we all know.</p> \n<p>In any event, this year, at the end of The Open, they announced that, from here on, there will be full equality. In other words, if next year I want to compete in the category as the one who follows, I can.</p> \n<p>An upheaval.</p> \n<p>I think there’s something in me that helps others accept the strange, the different and the special. In my opinion, something about my confidence in who I am comes across as calming to the other side. Even if I ask the most extreme homophobic male to dance, he’ll be okay with it.</p> \n<p>What do you do when you’re not dancing?</p> \n<p>In regular life I’m a procurement and tech manager for a properties and investment company.</p> \n<p>Sounds appallingly straight.</p> \n<p>I also design jewelry. I’ve sculpted since the age of 5, and I’m a fashion photographer, a singer and a professional makeup artist. I have a YouTube channel, I’m in a Bollywood musical as the bad guy. That’s the only place I don’t smile. And I also want a relationship, but that doesn’t always happen. Not everything happens by order – life isn’t Ali Express.</p> \n<p>Hagit Abu Draham, left, 41, lives in Maccabim, and Orit Reisman, 42, lives in Jerusalem; flying to Lisbon</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask if you’re sisters?</p> \n<p>Orit: Yes. There’s a year and a quarter between us.</p> \n<p>Hagit: Almost twins.</p> \n<p>Orit: We grew up together. Our parents died and it’s just the two of us, going on together.</p> \n<p>Do you travel together a lot?</p> \n<p>Orit: Occasionally. Most of the time we get along really well, and even if we argue, we make up. We don’t have much choice.</p> \n<p>Hagit: We’re opposites who complement each other in personality.</p> \n<p>Who’s on which side?</p> \n<p>Hagit: Orit is a good, romantic soul, a very spiritual, deep type. She’s an illustrator and a copyeditor. I’m more practical, down to earth, and also more temperamental. I’m a criminal lawyer.</p> \n<p>Orit: I’m now reading a book I worked on that has just been published [in Hebrew]. I did graphic design for the cover. It’s called “1,111 Days in My Life Plus Four” [originally published in English in 2006].</p> \n<p>Good title. Don’t you read the book before you design the cover?</p> \n<p>Orit: I read parts of it. It was written by a person named Ephraim Sten, who worked in Israel Television for many years and died [in 2004]. He was in the camps in Poland and kept a diary the entire time. After he reached Israel, he put the diary in a drawer and didn’t touch it for years. Only when he was quite old did he open it and read it, and added passages and notes. There are constantly two voices in the book: the young voice versus the elderly one.</p> \n<p>What do the numbers in the title refer to?</p> \n<p>Orit: He was in the camps for 1,111 days. The other four are days when he returned to Poland at an advanced age, to see the places he remembered. I like the book, because it has a very humorous and light approach and it’s very moving – but the truth is that I find everything related to the Holocaust to be very moving. That’s something I got at home.</p> \n<p>Hagit: We are second-generation survivors.</p> \n<p>Orit: Our parents survived the Holocaust, and apparently that has an effect.</p> \n<p>Were they in the camps?</p> \n<p>Orit: Dad was in a labor camp in Ukraine. He was 7 years old and he cut down trees, took care of horses and worked hard. And Mom was in a ghetto. That actually is one level below the most terrible experiences of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Hagit: Mom had a very good life until the age of 8, but Dad underwent more difficult things.</p> \n<p>Orit: There were always a lot discussions at home about the past and about memories, but also a lot of Zionism and love of Israel, because you have to keep going.</p> \n<p>Hagit: They were among those who talked, they didn’t hide things.</p> \n<p>Was there a trauma to hide?</p> \n<p>Orit: Mom immigrated to Israel right after the war, but Dad was a refusenik. He was in Romania, which was a communist country at the time, and was even in a pre-immigration Zionist agricultural training program, but the authorities found out about it and sent him to a labor camp. The result was that his whole family went to Israel and he remained there by himself for 10 years. They even censored the letters he got from Israel. He didn’t know about his father’s death in Israel. He only found out long afterward and then sat shivah, late and by himself.</p> \n<p>You speak as though it just happened.</p> \n<p>Hagit: For years, only Orit took an interest in the past and I didn’t want to hear about it. In the end we looked into our family roots and went to the places where our parents grew up.</p> \n<p>Did you go with your parents?</p> \n<p>Hagit: No, only the two of us, with my little girl. Our parents never wanted to go. They hated the Hungarians, the Romanians and the Czechs to the depths of their souls. We visited Mom’s town in Bukovina and Dad’s village in what was once Czechoslovakia and is now Romania.</p> \n<p>Orit: It was a moving trip. We were in the cemetery in Bukovina, which is very small, and we saw the local synagogue, which of course is now closed. There are no more Jews in those towns. For years we heard the descriptions of the town and of the river and the forest next to it, and in my imagination it was always black and white, but when we got there it looked colorful.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Let there be no hope for slanderers. Israel, as became clear this week for the umpteenth time, has a wise, responsible political and military leadership. It recognizes the limits of power of a small country in the face of its many foes — such as the armies of Hamas and Hezbollah, with their advanced weapons, excellent human and technological intelligence and highly capable, highly motivated combat forces.</p> \n<p>To wit, in order to reach the decision to destroy the tunnels built by Hezbollah reaching 40 meters into Israeli territory, it took half a dozen meetings of the security cabinet and there was a fierce dispute between the defense minister and the chief of staff. As we know, the chief of staff won, while the defense minister, who was concerned about the timing of this complex, dangerous operation, was forced to resign.</p> \n<p>And of course there were those who reminded us that without the backing of a superpower, a vulnerable state like Israel can’t launch a large-scale military operation like destroying those 40 meters of tunnels, because of its impact on the region, and perhaps on the entire world.</p> \n<p>To obtain the necessary backing, a high-level delegation, headed by the prime minister and the defense minister, went to Brussels to show U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his staff the terrifying intelligence, including solid proof that the tunnels had penetrated 40 meters into Israeli territory.</p> \n<p>Okay, the secretary said, wiping cold sweat from his brow, you want my permission to destroy them? Yes, the defense minister said, fixing him with an assertive gaze. You’re certain, the American persisted, that it’s within your power to carry out this dangerous operation? Positive, the prime minister replied.</p> \n<p>Pompeo, as is evident from the operation that continues even as you read these lines, approved it. He even lit a Hanukkah candle in honor of the modern-day Maccabees who are fighting — the few against the many, the weak against the strong — against the existential danger posed by the tunnels.</p> \n<p>Operation Northern Shield was launched, with appropriate symbolism, on the first night of Hanukkah, the holiday of Jewish heroism. Like that ancient war, it will evidently be crowned with the laurels of sacrifice, heroism and daring.</p> \n<p>Songs will be sung about it, and it will join our historic, unequivocal victories over Hezbollah in the Second Lebanon War of 2006 and Hamas in the subsequent campaigns in the south, Operation Cast Lead in 2009 and Operation Protective Edge in 2014. And also the latest heroic campaign against Hamas, which is still without a name, and which just ended — again, in a resounding victory.</p> \n<p>It’s well known that the Israel Defense Forces, especially in its large-scale operations, is creative and full of surprises. In Operation Northern Shield, it is continuing this tradition of creative surprises, evidently with great success.</p> \n<p>The operation, as we know, didn’t begin with airstrikes to destroy the tens of thousands of missiles that threaten Israel’s citizens and its infrastructure. Neither did the IDF send tanks and engineering units to exploit the shock of these airstrikes in order to destroy the entrances to the tunnels.</p> \n<p>Rather, before the enemy’s disbelieving gaze, it began the offensive this time with the latest doomsday weapon: nonlethal explosives. The next surprise was bulldozers instead of tanks, drilling rigs instead of planes and sensors instead of artillery. The heroism of the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit, which is waging critical psychological warfare day and night — especially against the enemies — also reached a peak this week.</p> \n<p>What about us, the missiles ask. Why were we forgotten once again? After all, we are 150,000 times more dangerous than the tunnels.</p> \n<p>You’ve always preferred to deceive yourselves, you stubborn Jews, and you learn nothing from history, not even that of the last century. But don’t wear blinders this time. Iran and Hezbollah didn’t deploy those missiles throughout Lebanon merely for them to rust.</p>",

Then it is redacted for four more lines.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The countless Israeli connections to Mueller's probe of Trump and Russia | Analysis</p> \n<p>The document also says that Flynn assisted in a separate criminal investigation in addition to the inquiry into foreign interference in the 2016 election.</p> \n<p>That again strikes many close observers of the Mueller probe as an implicit warning that Kushner may be involved.</p> \n<p>“Given that one of Flynn’s main tasks during the transition period was to set up back channel communications between Trump and his Russian handlers that would bypass U.S. intelligence services, it is very likely that the redacted portions of the sentencing memo are related to that endeavor,” Nancy LeTourneau&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;for Washington Monthly. “If so, Jared Kushner has reason to be very concerned.”</p> \n<p>Kushner himself has been interviewed by Mueller’s team. CNN reported last year that the conversation was largely about Flynn - which could imperil the First Family member.</p> \n<p>“If Flynn offered federal authorities a different version of events than Kushner - and Flynn’s version is buttressed by documentation or federal electronic surveillance of the former general - then the president’s son-in-law may have to start scrambling,” Bloomberg columnist Timothy L. O’Brien&nbsp;wrote.</p> \n<p>President Trump’s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said he wasn’t concerned about the Flynn deal.</p> \n<p>“If he had information to share with Mueller that hurt the president, you would know it by now,” he&nbsp;told NBC&nbsp;on Tuesday. “There’s a Yiddish word that fits. They don’t have bupkis.”</p> \n<p>The Israel connection to Kushner and the Trump/Russia scandal is not news.</p> \n<p>After winning election but before taking office, Trump was determined to show that he would be a stronger supporter of Israel than Obama. One of his priorities was to undermine Obama’s decision in his final month in office to abstain on the anti-Israel vote at the UN and allow it to pass, rather than veto it.</p> \n<p>Haaretz&nbsp;reported&nbsp;that Israeli officials also asked the Trump transition team to try to intervene to stop the resolution.</p> \n<p>Russia did not end up delaying the vote, which passed 14-0 with one abstention.</p> \n<p>Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI about his encounters and conversations with Russian officials like Kislyak, the ambassador to the United States. Flynn originally told the FBI that he had no memory of discussing the UN resolution with Kislyak, before later recanting and admitting he had lied. Mueller’s document reveals that Flynn eventually sat for 19 interviews with the Special Counsel’s team.</p> \n<p>Kislyak, and particularly his connection to Kushner, has been the center of intense speculation as journalists and investigators look at the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russian officials in 2016.</p> \n<p>According to&nbsp;The Washington Post,&nbsp;Kushner told Kislyak in early December 2016, a few weeks before the UN vote, that he wanted to set up a secure line of communication between the transition team and the Kremlin, and house it in a Russian diplomatic facility in the United States. Flynn also attended that meeting.</p> \n<p>Kushner also met during the transition with the president of a state-run Russian bank, a meeting that he initially did not report in his security clearance application. The White House says it was a diplomatic meeting taken at Kislyak’s request, while the bank said it was a business meeting in conjunction with Kushner’s real estate work.</p> \n<p>Kushner is believed to be the key figure who convinced President Trump to fire FBI director James Comey, which led to the creation of the special counsel’s office in the first place. The circumstances of Comey’s firing are also under investigation by the special counsel.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>With Tuesday's dramatic announcement that the Lebanese Hezbollah militia had dug tunnels under Israel's northern border frontier, the public stage of the tunnel-search operation began. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arranged a press conference, timed as usual to coincide with the top of the evening television news broadcasts. Not for the first time, Israeli army Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, who was at the prime minister's side, looked like he would rather be anywhere else.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot sat there, as usual, in his everyday uniform rather than dress uniform attire. His entire body language screamed “Help!” When it was his turn to speak, he sounded like a prisoner reciting a message drafted by his captors. He would probably have found root canal work more enjoyable.</p> \n<p>This is not the way the chief of staff comes across in closed meetings far from the public view, however. In the past year, cabinet ministers say, he has to a large degree been the one advancing the Israeli line of action, in both the north and south. He was the one who pushed for the offensive approach to stop Iran’s military entrenchment in Syria and then to neutralize the tunnel threat from Lebanon. He was also the one who pushed for a more restrained approach in Gaza, a stance that led him to clash vocally with certain cabinet ministers.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; A Hezbollah Blitzkrieg: Tunnels of Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan | Analysis ■&nbsp;Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;■&nbsp;The battle over the timing of Israel's operation against Hezbollah tunnels | Analysis</p> \n<p>Netanyahu felt the same way, but often kept himself at a safe distance behind the chief of staff. The prime minister’s frequent public statements this week regarding the tunnels in the north were notable compared to his silence just a few weeks ago in the course of the escalation in the south, when a massive barrage of rockets was launched into Israel from Gaza.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s current need for publicly demonstrated support from the army sometimes leads to a problematic blurring of boundaries. This was striking at the press conference, where senior officers were effectively serving as extras in footage that is sure to find its way into Likud election campaign material before long. And it was even starker when Netanyahu forced Eisenkot and Southern Command chief Herzl Halevi to participate in a politically charged meeting with the heads of the local authorities in the Negev last month.</p> \n<p>The sensitivity of things will only increase as the tension grows over decisions that Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit has to take on whether to indict Netanyahu. If another military escalation occurs in the meantime, the prime minister’s political rivals will question whether his judgment is being affected by his legal predicament. Public skepticism will also increase as a result. This is a critical question in a country where the draft is still mandatory and where the civilian home front is likely to be harmed in any wartime scenario.</p> \n<p>That too would be nothing new: In 2006, after the Second Lebanon War, Aluf Benn reported in Haaretz about a consultation that then-Prime Minister Ehud Omert held before deciding on the failed ground operation in the final 60 hours of the war. The man who arranged the meeting and also took part in it was none other than Olmert’s opinion polling consultant, although the parties involved denied that any political issues were discussed.</p> \n<p>Bad blood</p> \n<p>Eisenkot has recently been in the habit of starting meetings by noting how much time he has left in his tenure. In less than six weeks, he’ll be on route to being a free and happy man again. This is something he learned from one of his predecessors, Gabi Ashkenazi, who would count down what remained of his “sentence” with more than a year left to go as army chief of staff.</p> \n<p>The outgoing chief of staff does not hide how weary he has become of the politicians. It wasn’t just the press conference that was forced upon him this week.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot is disturbed by the false leaks from cabinet meetings, by the attacks on the military advocate general, by the growing tendency of the political right wing to portray the army as weak and defeatist, and by the possibility that all this will erode public trust in the army (despite latest annual Israel Democracy Institute survey indicating stability in this regard).</p> \n<p>As his term draws to a close, he still awaits the report of the committee he convened to review issues raised by the army's ombudsman, Yitzhak Brik, on army preparedness.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the bad blood that accumulated between Eisenkot and Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who resigned last month, is plainly showing now that there is no longer a need to feign mutual affection. This week Lieberman took off the gloves in an almost public manner. And Eisenkot, in private, speaks about the former defense minister in a way that recalls Ashkenazi’s relations with Ehud Barak.</p> \n<p>The media were filled this week with Lieberman’s complaints about the chief of staff’s refusal to embark on a ground incursion in Gaza last month. And the public only heard the softened version. In conversation with the former defense minister, some people heard him say that the army was “impotent” in Gaza and that the “pathetic” operation in the north was designed to erase the bad impression left by the critical series of letters written by Brik and reported in Haaretz. But at the time, when Brik had been yearning for support from Lieberman, the defense minister declined to get involved. After some hesitation, he actually declared that the army was readier for war than it had been since 1967.</p> \n<p>In recent months, the army's general staff has felt that Lieberman was acting like an internal opposition, losing his patience with the officers and frustrated by the alliance between Eisenkot and Netanyahu. In an interview during the summer with the Yedioth Ahronoth daily, Lieberman complained that “too many lawyers” were sitting in on meetings. At one meeting where the necessity of a Gaza operation was debated, Lieberman is said to have told the astounded officers that sometimes he felt like he was talking there to leaders of the left-wing Peace Now movement.</p> \n<p>In response, Lieberman’s office told Haaretz: “The outgoing defense minister has never commented upon and will never comment on closed military discussions or on rumors and gossip.”</p> \n<p>Lieberman was justly proud that he managed to keep the appointment process for the next army chief of staff from descending into a confrontation among the various candidates, as happened in the Harpaz affair, the 2011 affair over the selection of the subsequent chief of staff. But unfortunately for him, the success was not complete. The dirt just came out at higher levels, as a result of his disagreement with the prime minister.</p> \n<p>The quietest candidate</p> \n<p>Members of the general staff say that Maj.Gen. Nitzan Alon, the quietest and most modest of the candidates to succeed Eisenkot, spent several weeks believing he had a promise from Lieberman that he would be the next chief of staff. But Lieberman was not able to make this happen due to Netanyahu’s opposition. He was compelled to shift his support to Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi. Then, too, Lieberman resorted to a ploy — making an announcement of the nomination while Netanyahu was away (on a secret visit) in Oman.</p> \n<p>In the wake of all the current upheaval in the appointment process for a new chief of the Israel Police, Alon’s name has even been mentioned as a possible candidate for the post. But when the time comes to appoint new heads of the Mossad espionage agency and the Shin Bet security service, he is likely to be viewed as a serious candidate.</p> \n<p>All of the candidates emerged from the appointment process for the next army chief of staff with some hard feelings. Alon had been given a promise that evaporated. Kochavi, who had been pegged as future chief of staff material from around the time he was 30, ended up being perceived as a choice of last resort, who neither the prime minister nor the defense minister wanted as their first choice.</p> \n<p>Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir was assigned to the position of deputy chief of staff only after Netanyahu’s intervention and Lieberman’s resignation. (Lieberman had not backed the appointment). And the fourth candidate, Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, was essentially out of the running two and a half years ago, after his controversial Holocaust Remembrance Day speech and the public hazing that the right had subjected him to ever since.</p> \n<p>It’s no wonder that Eisenkot is wrapping up his tenure with displeasure over the conduct of politicians, and that Kochavi will be starting his term as army chief of staff in a less celebratory mood than should have been the case (and without getting the longer period to break himself into the job that he had wanted). But the situation also presents a certain advantage. Like Benny Gantz and Eisenkot before him — chiefs of staff who were also only appointed to the position after the prime minister had exhausted all of the other possibilities — Kochavi doesn’t owe anyone anything. This could be a useful point of departure for him, if he chooses to adopt it.</p> \n<p>Despite everything going on behind the scenes, interestingly, Lieberman refrained this week from directly criticizing Netanyahu. And when he resigned last month, he did not make his criticism about the government’s policy in Gaza personal. When you consider that Netanyahu chose to keep Sharon Shalom, Lieberman’s chief of staff and loyal confidant, in place at the Defense Ministry, perhaps it indicates that the parting of ways between Netanyahu and Lieberman is only temporary.</p> \n<p>Since there was no army operation in Gaza last month, Lieberman had to resign from the government and outflank it on the right to survive the next Knesset elections. But after the elections, Netanyahu may not be able to find a more comfortable partner than Lieberman at the Defense Ministry. And that's not just because he is not keen to give Habayit Hayehudi leader Naftali Bennett the job.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s chief concern is his political survival in the face of the looming threat of criminal indictments. Since Lieberman, like the ultra-Orthodox parties, doesn't think it necessary that the prime minister resign if and when he is indicted, it’s quite possible that Netanyahu will ultimately choose to reward him once again with the defense portfolio. In other words, it may be premature for the army to be badmouthing Lieberman.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan once again proved his haplessness and negligence in choosing nominees for police commissioner by selecting his ministry’s director general, Maj. Gen. (ret.) Moshe Edri, despite the numerous skeletons in his closet.</p> \n<p>Erdan then added insult to injury when he stuck by his nominee even though the Goldberg Committee – whose job is to vet the ethics of candidates for top civil service posts – rejected Edri.</p> \n<p>Following reports that the attorney general was considering telling the cabinet it isn’t bound by the Goldberg Committee’s decision, additional details about Edri’s behavior emerged this week. Among other things, he had a preliminary conversation with the woman who ultimately administered his polygraph test, and also worked to help a relative who served as a policeman in a unit he commanded.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Say no to Edri for police chief | Editorial</p> \n<p>This new information led Edri to withdraw from the race for the commissioner’s job, but the ramifications of this wretched affair shouldn’t end there. The behavior of both the government, which refused to adopt the Goldberg Committee’s position, and the attorney general, who appears to be trying to undermine the committee’s authority, proves just how badly the committee is needed.</p> \n<p>The fact that Erdan, along with ministers Ayelet Shaked and Naftali Bennett, rushed to reject the views of a committee that the government itself established, and whose continued operation it ratified just half a year ago, proves that the Goldberg Committee serves as the last barrier to the complete politicization of appointments to senior positions in the defense establishment and the civil service. It is therefore necessary not only to preserve it, but even to strengthen it by making its decisions officially binding on the government.</p> \n<p>Additionally, the information since discovered about Edri must lead to his dismissal from his post as director general of the Public Security Ministry. Someone who has failed, time after time, to comply with basic ethical norms cannot continue serving in a job financed by a government ministry.</p> \n<p>In the past, the High Court of Justice overruled Yossi Ginossar’s appointment as director general of the Housing Ministry due to his “criminal past.” Edri, based on the discoveries of the past few days, appears to have something approaching a “criminal present.” This requires steps to be taken to remove him from his current job.</p>",

        "text":["<p>OPEC tentatively agreed an oil-output cut on Thursday but was waiting to hear from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding the exact volumes for a production reduction aimed at propping up crude prices, two sources from the group said.</p> \n<p>Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak flew home from Vienna earlier for talks with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Novak returns to the Austrian capital on Friday for discussions among&nbsp;Saudi-led OPEC and the group's allies.</p> \n<p>The price of crude has fallen almost a third since October but U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries make oil even cheaper by refraining from output cuts.</p> \n<p>&quot;We hope to conclude something by the end of the day tomorrow ... We have to get the non-OPEC countries on board,&quot;&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters before the OPEC meeting started.</p> \n<p>&quot;If everybody is not willing to join and contribute equally, we will wait until they are.&quot;</p> \n<p>Asked whether OPEC could fail to reach a deal, Falih said all options were on the table. Possible output cuts by OPEC and its allies ranged from 0.5-1.5 million bpd, and 1 million bpd was acceptable, he said.</p> \n<p>OPEC's closed-door meeting began around 1100 GMT and was still ongoing after 2-1/2 hours.</p> \n<p>Brent oil futures fell as much as 5 percent to below $59 per barrel on fears that there could be no deal but later recovered somewhat, trading down 2 percent by 1325 GMT.</p> \n<p>&quot;One million bpd may disappoint many. But should the cut be from a September or October baseline, rather than November, the net impact would be sufficient to limit storage builds,&quot; Greg Sharenow, executive vice-president for Pimco, said on the sidelines of the OPEC meeting.</p> \n<p>&quot;It is unlikely to spark a meaningful price rally, but also will not be so dire either. In many respects it is the middle road, which may be the optimal solution,&quot; said Sharenow, who helps manage a $15 billion commodities fund at the $1.77 trillion U.S. investment management firm.</p> \n<p>OPEC delegates have said the group and its allies could cut by 1 million bpd if Russia contributed 150,000 bpd of that reduction. If Russia contributed around 250,000 bpd, the overall cut could exceed 1.3 million bpd.</p> \n<p>Novak said on Thursday that Russia would find it harder to cut oil output in winter than other producers because of the cold weather.</p> \n<p>Oil prices have crashed as&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output since June after Trump called for higher production to offset lower exports from Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer.</p> \n<p>Russia,&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry.</p> \n<p>TRUMP RAISES PRESSURE</p> \n<p>Iranian exports have plummeted after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in November. But Washington gave sanctions waivers to some buyers of Iranian crude, further raising fears of an oil glut next year.</p> \n<p>&quot;Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The world does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!&quot; Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday he would support a cut as long as Iran did not need to reduce its own output. Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said Iraq as OPEC's second-largest producer would support and join a cut.</p> \n<p>Possibly complicating any OPEC decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A party primary in Germany this Friday could determine who becomes the next “leader of the free world,” following Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent decision to step down as chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).</p> \n<p>The conservative party will be choosing its first new leader in nearly 20 years, with Merkel’s successor in a decent position to head the next government in 2021. Recent polls show the center-right party ahead of its rivals, although that popularity has been slipping for more than a year now.</p> \n<p>Some conservatives say the decline is due to the liberal immigration policy Merkel imposed on her party in late 2015, when she drew both praise and brickbats for allowing hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany.</p> \n<p>The chancellor’s critics would like to see the CDU move to the right on immigration, in a bid to stem the continued rise of the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is now the third-largest party in the German parliament.</p> \n<p>Friday’s race to become party chairman – Merkel is set to remain as chancellor until her fourth term officially ends in 2021 – is between three wildly different candidates.</p> \n<p>According to the polls, the favorite to replace Merkel is one of her loyalists, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (more commonly known as AKK). She is the party’s general secretary and a confidant of the chancellor. Although Kramp-Karrenbauer has somewhat distanced herself from her patron recently, her election would likely see a continuation of Merkel’s centrist policies.</p> \n<p>However, although she appeals to the more liberal voters Merkel has brought to the party, AKK’s ascension would likely do nothing to quell dissatisfaction from other parts of the CDU. In a bid to counter that, the 56-year-old has said she wants provide a greater platform for the different viewpoints within her party.</p> \n<p>Kramp-Karrenbauer has repeatedly spoken out against anti-Semitism in Germany and accused the AfD of harboring anti-Semites. She is also strongly opposed to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, and in May dedicated an entire op-ed in Germany’s largest tabloid, Bild, to the subject.</p> \n<p>Kramp-Karrenbauer’s biggest rival is Friedrich Merz. The 63-year-old served as leader of the conservative faction in the Bundestag from 2000 until 2002, until Merkel unseated him and began reshaping their party. Merz eventually quit politics in 2009, going on to work as a corporate lawyer for various businesses. Since 2016, he has been supervisory board chairman for the German subsidiary of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment management firm.</p> \n<p>His corporate background is clearly seen in his economic agenda, in which he proposes tax cuts for the rich and the implementation of tax-free stock investments. He is also an avowed Atlanticist, heading a U.S.-German think tank to promote transatlantic relations. He has also urged Germany to get tougher on Russia, and in 2016 supported the European Union’s sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> \n<p>However, Merz’s corporate roots and elitist aura have also been a source of criticism. He identifies as middle class, despite his declared annual income of 1 million euros (nearly $1,335,000).</p> \n<p>He was the first to declare his candidacy to replace Merkel and is running a close second in recent polls – appealing to the party’s traditionally conservative supporters. He promises to take a tougher stance on immigration, even questioning the constitutional right to seek asylum in Germany.</p> \n<p>That kind of message could signify a return to power for the party’s old, right-leaning establishment, which had been marginalized under Merkel and her more centrist peers. Merz could possibly encourage voters who had switched to the AfD to return to the fold, but his fiscally and socially conservative profile could also drive away more center-leaning voters.</p> \n<p>The final candidate is Jens Spahn, who is seen as the rank outsider. The 38-year-old has been a vocal critic of Merkel’s immigration policy over the years, developing a network of up-and-coming politicians within the party.</p> \n<p>He has also warned about anti-Semitism being imported into Germany due to its influx of Muslim immigrants. Anti-Semitism is “an omnipresent part of everyday life” in a number of Muslim countries, Spahn said last December.&nbsp;He faced criticism for his remarks, with the German Jewish newspaper J&uuml;dische Allgemeine accusing him of using allegations of anti-Semitism to bash immigrants while conveniently forgetting its role in Germany's history. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>He currently serves as health minister in Merkel’s governing coalition and has won plaudits for a program to hire some 13,000 caregivers for the elderly – a profession in which Germany suffers a chronic shortage.</p> \n<p>He has also repeatedly attacked Germany’s Green Party for its supposedly liberal and globalist beliefs, and presents himself as being tough on immigration. However, that message does not seem to be clicking with the party base.</p> \n<p>As a result, the 1,001 delegates at Friday’s annual party congress in Hamburg are expected to choose between Kramp-Karrenbauer and Merz (although a poll published Sunday in Bild Am Sonntag said barely a quarter knew who they were voting for, or were prepared to say publicly).</p> \n<p>Whoever wins will face a challenging future. The new leader of the CDU may have to position themselves against Merkel’s policies as she sees out her last term as chancellor – potentially making the party appear divided. Merz and Merkel are said to endure a difficult relationship due to their historic power struggle in the early 2000s. Indeed, should he become the new party leader, it is possible Merkel might step down as chancellor before 2021, leading to new elections or difficult negotiations with the party’s coalition partners.</p> \n<p>Any power struggle could also lead to a further decline in the party’s popularity. The Green Party has surged in the polls since Germany’s last federal election in late 2017, and now presents itself as a liberal alternative to the center-right party. This means that the winner on Friday may have to deal with their party being downgraded to being just one among many, and not the automatic first choice to run the country.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The ultra-Orthodox “society of learners” has long been regarded as a uniquely Israeli phenomenon. Where else but in the Jewish state would a government not only agree to let a large segment of the population shun secular education and the labor market to pursue a life of Torah study, but use taxpayers’ money to enable this to happen?</p> \n<p>But the same phenomenon has been quietly happening in New York for quite some time and only now is the problem it poses gradually being acknowledged.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After the city did everything possible to avoid grappling with the issue, the New York State Department of Education has recently issued rules to enforce a modicum of secular education at non-public schools (read Haredi yeshivas) and is vowing penalties against violators.</p> \n<p>As crackdowns go, it’s not very much, but it’s an important start. That’s because it takes aim at the foundation of the society of learners phenomenon, which seeks to ensure that all ultra-Orthodox men spend as much of their life in religious studies as possible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In that model, the role of the yeshivas is immerse: boys and young men in Torah learning to the exclusion of virtually any other education that might give them an opening to the outside world, in particular the temptations of a job and money.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to a study by Young Advocates for a Fair Education (YAFFED) – a group that has been pressing New York authorities to force yeshivas to follow education laws – the youngest Haredi boys get about six hours a week of instruction of basic English and math. The classes are an afterthought after a grueling day of religious studies and often taught by unqualified teachers. In any case, even that minimal effort comes to an end after the boys reach age 13.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Like their brothers in Israel, when they become adults there’s little these men are trained to do besides continue to study or hold the most menial job. Many are only fluent in Yiddish and are so isolated that they aren’t aware of what they don’t know, and lack the most basic tool to rectify their deficiencies.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The result is the same dynamic that operates in Bnai Brak operates in Brooklyn. Ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the epicenter of American ultra-Orthodoxy, are poor; two suburban towns that are exclusively Haredi are the two poorest in New York State.</p> \n<p>Haredi leaders have fought an angry counter-offensive to keep the education authorities out of their yeshivas, on the grounds that they are following the way of life Jews have observed over the centuries. Interfering with a yeshiva’s curriculum is an assault on freedom of education and religion.</p> \n<p>Certainly those issues are relevant to the debate about the yeshivas, but they aren’t decisive. Society and the state have an obligation to set standards, especially if the well-being of millions of people is at stake, even if it may interfere with individual freedoms. That’s the price we all pay for living in urban, networked societies. The recent outbreak of measles in the Haredi community is a case in point: A parents’ freedom not to vaccinate violates others’ right to health.</p> \n<p>In Israel, the society of learners has become so big, as the Haredi population has grown, that is has begun to have impact on the entire economy. Every Haredi man who can’t or won’t get a secular education and enter the labor market puts a great burden of producing and paying taxes on the rest. It poses a threat to the future of the country.</p> \n<p>The U.S. is far too big for the ultra-Orthodox to create that kind of problem, but New York City is not.</p> \n<p>There are only 240,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews in the greater New York area, but they are impoverished (43% are defined as poor and 16% as near poor). They get by via a mix of mostly badly paid work and increasingly on government assistance.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unlike most impoverished communities, Haredim know how to work the system both to benefit families and educational institutions. They make efficient use of every program available. For instance, in two largely ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, Williamsburg and Borough Park, the proportion of residents getting food assistance (the SNAP program) runs at 51.8% and 33.8%, respectively, versus just 20.4% for all of New York City.</p> \n<p>The lion’s share of assistance come legally, but the pressure to find money to keep an increasingly impoverished community afloat makes it tempting to skirt the law, as the Lakewood, New Jersey welfare fraud case illustrates.</p> \n<p>The pressure is only going to grow. Because of its high birthrate, the Haredi population is expanding rapidly. YAFFED forecasts that if current demographic trends continue by 2030, the Haredi school-age population will account for up to 37% of Brooklyn’s total and 13% of New York’s. Needless to say, the overall Haredi population will show the same numbers, i.e., New York will be home to a large and growing community of poor and uneducated.</p> \n<p>Haredim are by no means the only New Yorkers who suffer those socioeconomic problems, but they are the only ones who make it a principle to deny their children a minimum of opportunity to escape them.</p> \n<p>Just like Israel, the city and state have an obligation not only to Haredi children but to the future of New York to make sure that doesn’t happen.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Can we talk?</p> \n<p>In response to “Israeli army says applying lessons learned in Gaza to foil Hezbollah’s tunnels” (Amos Harel, December 5.)</p> \n<p>All Israeli residents will rightly support the arm’s destruction of attack tunnels into our country. Whether from Lebanon or Gaza, the tunnels are a dangerous threat to our soldiers and citizens. Nevertheless, one may question the allocation of resources to sealing Israel from the rest of the world. A combination of Iron Dome and other anti-missile defenses, plus underground barriers will surely ensure our security in the near future, but shouldn’t we at least consider attempting to deal with the source of these enterprises? Why not invest more effort in understanding and neutralizing the motivation of those digging the tunnels and firing the rockets?</p> \n<p>One option is to use military means. In other words launch attacks against Hamas, Hezbollah and other forces that threaten us, but the defense establishment has shown a notable reluctance to apply such methods. This leaves us with the more rational approach of negotiation. Hamas clearly wants a so-called hudna, a long-term truce. Hezbollah has actually been observing such a truce since the Second Lebanon War. But how about talking to the Iranians, who support both these movements? This would go to the heart of the matter and, if successful, result in long-term security for Israel.</p> \n<p>Most Israelis will voice skepticism about this proposal, suggesting that there is nothing to talk about with a nation that describes us as a “cancer” and calls for our destruction, but it should be pointed out that the Saudi initiative, later the Arab Peace Initiative, calling for peace with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal to the pre-Six-Day War borders and the establishment of a Palestinian state, has been accepted by the Muslim countries also, including Iran. We may be reluctant to accept the terms of the initiative, as stated, but surely there is a basis here for negotiation.</p> \n<p>How about setting aside the doomsday scenario, whereby Israel has to live with a perpetual existential threat, and trying a more hopeful way?</p> \n<p>Daniel Gavron</p> \n<p>Motza Ilit</p> \n<p>We can handle&nbsp;the truth</p> \n<p>In response to “Voters, not the police or the courts, should decide Netanyahu’s future” (Alan M. Dershowitz, December 6)</p> \n<p>Of necessity, criminal prosecutions are started out of the public eye, allowing investigators to freely engage sources and assess their credibility. If they decide a crime has occurred and it is worth prosecuting, they indict. The trial or plea is where the public learns the whole truth.&nbsp; If a politician’s crimes include manipulation of the media, as the charges here imply, the need for a trial or robust investigation to out all of the facts is even more apparent. Dershowitz thinks Israelis, and the rest of us with a stake in Israel’s survival, can’t handle the truth. I think they, and we, can.</p> \n<p>Stuart Wilder, </p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Police harassment</p> \n<p>Thank God for Alan Dershowitz, who is not afraid to shout that the emperor (in this case the Israel Police) has no clothes. Surely our ironmen of the law have better things to do than harass politicians who smoke bigger cigars than their own. How about catching criminals, or is that too difficult and dangerous ?</p> \n<p>David Frank,</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>A better way?</p> \n<p>In response to “A Hezbollah blitzkrieg: Tunnels on Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan” (Amos Harel, December 6)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The discovery of the tunnel threat on the northern border and its presumed removal by the army show that the generations-old conflict continues. Is this hide-and-seek the best that can be done under circumstances that have barely changed in seven decades and look to be still with us in 2019 and far beyond?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The capacity of human beings to regroup and develop new tactics in long-running wars has been a constant of history. But the results of such endeavor have always been unfortunate for nations and individuals, the morality of each move and countermove in too many cases being more than questionable.</p> \n<p>Is there any morally acceptable way of engaging in warfare that does not diminish and demean our common humanity, offering us only regret and recrimination that we could not conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of the best that is in our nature and not its worst?</p> \n<p>John Cronin,</p> \n<p>via Haaretz.com</p> \n<p>Mendelblit’s tricks</p> \n<p>One would have to be stupid or living on another planet not to see that Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit is using every trick in the book to protect Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from indictment. He is dragging this case out to the max, in the hope that the public will eventually lose interest. One of his latest tricks is the enlargement of the legal team overseeing the cases. The intention is to create as much diversity of oppinion as possible so as not to form a consensus (clever trick).</p> \n<p>It is absurd that the decision whether to indict is given to one individual. In the U.S., these decsions are made by a grand jury.</p> \n<p>One has to think that knowing Mendelblit is a religious person, he must be cognizant of the fact that if this current governing coalition is replaced, there is a strong possibiity that a new one will be much “less religious,” and that would not suit him at all.</p> \n<p>The Israeli public deserves better. We are now being exposed to the real depths of corruption that this country has sunk to. It has become a cesspool of corruption. It is beginning to make Israel look like a Third-World banana republic.</p> \n<p>The megalomaniac on Balfour Street in Jerusalem (and his wife) need to be given their pink slips so that someone responsible can replace them and clean house. The only ones who will miss them are those exclusive restaurants in Jerusalem that provided all those gourmet take-away meals, at the public’s expense.</p> \n<p>Mitchell Radov</p> \n<p>Ashdot Ya’akov &nbsp; Answering Danon</p> \n<p>In addressing the United Nations on the 71 anniversary of the vote to partition Palestine, Israeli UN ambassador Danny Dannon set three conditions in which Palestinians can have a bright future. While his speech offered nothing new in content, here is a Palestinian response to Danon.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel can have a long and lasting peace beginning tomorrow if it meets these three conditions.</p> \n<p>1. Honor all UN resolutions, not only the one it likes. No cherry-picking!</p> \n<p>2. Lift the strangling and inhumane siege on the Gaza Strip! Collective punishment is a form of war crime.</p> \n<p>3. Free the 5,640 Palestinian political prisoners (including women and children) currently being held in Israeli prisons.</p> \n<p>Mahmoud El-Yousseph</p> \n<p>Westerville, Ohio</p> \n<p>On political assassinations</p> \n<p>In response to “A Swedish lesson in political violence” (David Stavrou, November 12)</p> \n<p>Tragic events may cause national traumas, especially when they are not solved, as in the murder of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in Stockholm as he and his wife left a movie theater in February 1986. Stavrou draws a link between the murder of Palme and that of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin after a peace rally in Tel Aviv on November 4, 1995.</p> \n<p>In both cases, he rightly writes, democratic societies were challenged by forces who use violence and must find the strength to defend themselves against those who abuse fundamental freedoms and rights.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Israel the murderer was a Jewish right-wing extremist, who was immediately apprehended and has been sentenced to life in prison. The repercussions of the murder, however, are still felt in Israel. A promising peace process was derailed and has not gotten back on track since then.</p> \n<p>The incitement inside Israel against “leftist” peace proponents has continued unabated.</p> \n<p>In Sweden, the murderer was never caught and the field was left open for speculations and conspiracy theories. But this doesn’t imply, as Stavrou claims, that the murder didn’t expose divides in Swedish society, though not of the same magnitude as in Israel.</p> \n<p>Olof Palme was a controversial politician in his own country and part of the bourgeois opposition hated him. One of the tracks in the murder investigation was the so-called police track concerning allegations that a cell of far-right policemen was behind the murder but it wasn’t sufficiently examined.</p> \n<p>While both Israel and Sweden had to cope with the traumas following political assassinations, Sweden still “sanctifies freedom of expression and freedom of assembly” in a way that even Israel, despite its incomparably more difficult security situation, could learn from instead of copying illiberal policies from other countries.</p> \n<p>Mose Apelblat</p> \n<p>Kfar Sava</p> \n<p>Happy birthday,&nbsp;‘ol Blue Eyes’</p> \n<p>Legendary singer/actor/producer/director and a staunch supporter of Israel, Frank Sinatra was born 103 years ago, on December 12, 1915.

        "text":["<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel's party is meeting Friday to elect a new leader who could help shape Germany's political direction for the next generation.</p> \n<p>A close ally of Merkel's and a one-time rival are considered favorites for the job to lead the center-right Christian Democratic Union.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; These are the candidates vying to replace Angela Merkel</p> \n<p>Merkel announced in October she would give up the reins in her party, though she has said she plans to remain chancellor until the end of the current term in 2021. However, it's possible elections could be called before then.</p> \n<p>Three high-profile contenders have spent the last month touring Germany to drum up support. Major German parties have tended to determine their leaders without a contest, and this is the first open competition for the CDU leadership since 1971.</p> \n<p>The outcome is hard to predict, and the race between the two favorites is expected to be close. Whoever wins will be favorite to run for chancellor in the next election, though that isn't automatic.</p> \n<p>The favorites are CDU general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a Merkel ally who is widely considered the chancellor's preferred successor and is closest to her centrist stance; and Friedrich Merz, a former leader of the party's parliamentary group who stands for a more conservative approach and is seeking a comeback after a decade away from front-line politics.</p> \n<p>Both have prominent backers, though many CDU grandees — including the chancellor — have held off publicly endorsing a candidate.</p> \n<p>Health Minister Jens Spahn, another Merkel critic, is considered the outsider. At 38, he would stand for a change of generation. Kramp-Karrenbauer is 56 and Merz 63, only a year younger than the chancellor.</p> \n<p>The choice will be made by 1,001 delegates at a party congress in Hamburg, many of them professional or part-time politicians at federal, regional or local level.</p> \n<p>Merkel has been CDU leader since 2000 and chancellor since 2005. She moved her party relentlessly to the center, dropping military conscription, accelerating Germany's exit from nuclear energy, introducing benefits encouraging fathers to look after their young children and allowing the introduction of gay marriage.</p> \n<p>Most controversially, she allowed large numbers of asylum-seekers into Germany in 2015.</p> \n<p>For years, Merkel's popularity lifted the CDU and its Bavaria-only sister party, the Christian Social Union. In the 2013 election, they won 41.5 percent of the vote and only just fell short of an outright parliamentary majority.</p> \n<p>At present, the center-right bloc is polling under 30 percent. Merkel's fourth-term governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats has lurched through a series of crises since taking office in March, and the CDU has lost supporters both to the liberal Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany.</p> \n<p>Merkel said Thursday that 18 years at the helm &quot;is a long, long time — and the CDU has, of course, experienced ups and downs in this time,&quot; but also won four consecutive elections.</p> \n<p>&quot;I am grateful for the time that is behind me, and I am glad for being able to continue working as chancellor,&quot; she said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Hamas began paying salaries to its employees on Friday, a day after Qatar&nbsp;delivered the second $15-million payment to the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>According to Gaza's Finance Ministry, each employee is to receive approximately half of their monthly salary in this second round of payments, which was coordinated with Israel.</p> \n<p>Some $5 million of the total amount has been earmarked to pay wages of Hamas officials. Another one-third is allocated to the families of those&nbsp;killed and wounded in confrontations&nbsp;with Israeli forces, and the rest will be used to foster employment, according to assessments.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;With Gaza quiet, Israel’s next challenge could come from West Bank&nbsp;■&nbsp;These Israeli troops were deeply scarred by a Gaza war incident, but never told anyone. Until now</p> \n<p>Israeli&nbsp;officers have argued during recent security briefings that the decision to allow&nbsp;Qatari&nbsp;funding, which was&nbsp;criticized by many Israelis, creates a narrow window of opportunity for Israel to propose solutions to&nbsp;Gaza’s humanitarian woes in return for a long-term cease-fire.&nbsp;The officials believe that if Israel does not act within several weeks, another round of fighting is likely.</p> \n<p>Even though many Israelis criticized what they considered a limp-wristed response to the&nbsp;hundreds of rockets&nbsp;Hamas fired at Israel last month, Hamas has been deterred by the latest round and doesn't want to lose any more assets than it already has, according to Israeli intelligence assessments.</p> \n<p>Therefore, the Israeli army wants the National Security Council to move forward with rehabilitation projects that have been discussed in recent months. If this effort fails, security officials warn, Hamas is likely to escalate the situation in an effort to attract global attention, even at the price of another round of fighting with Israel.</p> \n<p>Currently, Hamas is trying to make the most of its recent achievement to&nbsp;secure financial aid&nbsp;and would not want to resume fighting before reaping maximum benefit from the latest round, the officers assess. The Israeli army believes&nbsp;Hamas&nbsp;needs visible steps it can present to Gaza's residents as suitable recompense for the heavy casualties they suffered during the weekly demonstrations along the Israeli border.</p> \n<p>Despite the poor weather conditions, large numbers of protesters are expected to gather along the border later on Friday to participate in the weekly demonstration. The committee that organizes the marches has called on Gaza's residents to participate en masse, dubbing this Friday's march &quot;The Great Stone Intifada.&quot; Attendance is also expected to be high in light of a U.S.-backed resolution condemning Hamas being voted down at the United Nations late on Thursday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank criticized Hamas, accusing it of selling the blood of Palestinian protestors killed or injured by the Israeli army in recent months for Qatari money. Hamas has denied these accusations, claiming the payment of salaries is a proof of the success of the weekly marches.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of Palestinian Authority employees in the West Bank received 50 percent of their salaries Friday after the government in Ramallah transferred the funds to local banks.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's wife, Sara, was questioned under caution on Friday by the police for over three hours&nbsp;on suspicion of fraudulently deceiving the state comptroller over the employment terms of the family's former media adviser Nir Hefetz.</p> \n<p>The case was investigated as an appendix to the Bezeq-Walla bribery case, following the testimony of state's witness Hefetz. Attorney Dan Shimron, who was also involved in the case, testified to the police at the same time.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's lawyer, Yossi Cohen, said after the questioning that he believes it will turn out to be &quot;another pack of lies and tales by state's witness Nir Hefetz, which have no substance.&quot; According to Cohen, &quot;new lies are fabricated&quot; as other cases concerning the Netanyahu family &quot;crash&quot;.</p> \n<p>The case started with the prime minister's request to the state comptroller, as Haaretz had reported, to arrange Hefetz's employment as the family's spokesman, after he had refused to be paid for his services.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: 'Flush your iPhone': The minute this scandal became a Netanyahu bribery case ■ 'Sara's top aide in New York': The businessman police say connected Elovitch to the Netanyahus</p> \n<p>In 2014, Hefetz and lawyer David Shimron met Comptroller Joseph Shapira, who referred them to his office's permits committee to check if Hefetz's unpaid employment could be authorized. During the talks with the committee, one of the participants suggested that the Netanyahus donate money to a voluntary organization instead. But in fact the committee did not permit Netanyahu to employ Hefetz without payment and he continued working for the family free of charge without a permit.</p> \n<p>At a certain stage the Netanyahus' submitted to the permits' committee receipts for 8,000 shekels that were donated to the Yad Sara NGO instead of paying Hefetz. However, Hefetz's testimony to the police in January raised a suspicion that the receipts given in exchange for his wages were in fact for assistance the NGO had given a relative of Sara Netanyahu. The police fraud unit officers are expected to investigate the suspicion that Netanyahu had tried to defraud the state comptroller by giving him the receipts.</p> \n<p>If the prosecution decides to indict Netanyahu in this case, it will be added to the indictment already served against her regarding offenses in the prime minister's residences.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu associates said on Thursday that they still have no idea what she is expected to be questioned about and over what suspicions.</p>",

        "text":["<p>There’s an old adage that it takes a village to raise a child. In Israeli basketball. a small village in the northeast is helping Gilboa/Galil compete successfully against Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Jerusalem, the giants of the nation’s basketball league. The team is located in the small village of Gan Ner (population 2,700) near Mt. Gilboa, and the town’s rabid fan base and support for the players and team has helped to defeat both of their well-heeled competitors in the past month.</p> \n<p>Gilboa/Galil has defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv, whose annual budget is more than 10 times larger, in seven of their last eight regular season meetings, as well as besting Hapoel Jerusalem five times in the past three years. They are currently tied for first place in the Premier League with a 6-2 record.</p> \n<p>The northern team has improved incrementally in the four seasons since returning from relegation, posting a winning record last season before losing in the quarter-finals of the league playoffs.</p> \n<p>“We had to change our approach completely after returning to the Premier League,” says the team’s general manager, Artzi Frati. The general manager, a lifelong resident of a neighboring moshav, has been in charge of operations for the past five years. He told Ha’aretz that the team’s reversal of fortunes is based on its development of up-and-coming talent in its youth program, while fostering positive chemistry among the parent club’s players.</p> \n<p>Also, they have successfully chosen their foreign players, some of whom were barely known, through careful vetting of their character as well as their basketball skills. Finally, effort was invested in establishing an atmosphere of warmth and mutual support between the team and the Gilboa Regional Council and especially with the host community in Gan Ner. Artzi refers to these principles as “the team’s DNA,” adding, “We don’t sacrifice our values for the sake of a few extra victories.”</p> \n<p>Tamir Estrago is among a core of 30-40 volunteers from Gan Ner who work closely with the players. When new players join the squad, he takes them around town to get them acquainted and oriented. “Each of the players live in Gan Ner separately in the home of one of the town’s families, and we give support and advice to any of them when they might need it.”</p> \n<p>Families invite players for Friday-night meals and to the family sukkah for Sukkot. Most of the players are very young. Artzi: “We try to look for foreign players under the age of 25 so it’s important to give them a feeling of home and support in a strange country.” Artzi figures this special relationship with the community is one-third responsible for the team’s success.</p> \n<p>In return, the team gives back to the community. Every year, the whole village is invited to the team’s opening practice before the beginning of the season. “Following this year’s practice, the town and the players shared a feast with 150 fans.” The team also has a policy of recognizing veteran members of the yishuv during time-outs of home games.</p> \n<p>If there is one player who’s the model of Gilboa/Galil’s approach, it’s Joaquin Shuchman, who has been in the club’s system for nine years, the past six with the parent team. At 23, Shuchman has been team captain for four years, the youngest player in the history of the Premier League to captain a team. Though not the most gifted athlete, his frenetic style of play, particularly on defense, and buoyant personality is infectious. Shuchman has turned down richer offers from higher profile teams in Israel to remain where he is.</p> \n<p>Shuchman immigrated from Argentina at age seven with his family, who settled in Nahariya. Artzi spotted him playing in a youth league at age 14 and was impressed by his potential. He helped the Shuchman family move to a local moshav and arranged housing and work for everyone. Shuchman himself gives recognition to the team’s professional staff, atmosphere of cooperation and close support of the community, agreeing that it’s vital to Gilboa/Galil’s success.</p> \n<p>The team’s fast start can be attributed to continued development of their Israeli players such as Shuchman, Tal Karpels and Natanel Artzi, who complement their four new foreigners, Bryant Crawford, James Kelley, Ian Miller and Greg Whittington.</p> \n<p>The man who puts it together for Gilboa/Galil is coach Ariel Beit Halachmi, who took over the reins during the final third of the team’s relegation season and has remained with them since. Beit Halachmi enhanced his reputation this summer by coaching Israel’s Men’s Under 20 basketball team to a European title. This was the first time in history that any Israeli team won a FIBA championship at any level.</p> \n<p>Beit Halachmi’s team employs pressure defense and an up-tempo offense that has Gilboa/Galil leading the league in scoring with 93.8 points a contest. He says this year’s team is probably more athletic and plays a faster pace that his previous teams, but is cautious. “It’s early in the season, we have a young team that needs to work on staying relaxed and in control, and hopefully we can avoid the run of serious injuries that hit us last season.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>“We can really achieve a breakthrough that may of course be historic, a first,” MK Miki Zohar (Likud) said at the meeting of the committee he formed to pass a bill requiring internet service providers to block access to porn websites as the default. To enter such a site, you’d have to key in a code.</p> \n<p>”If in the end we reach understandings on all the issues, I think we’ll finally have a law and a real solution for children,” Zohar said.</p> \n<p>Well, there may be a law, but the last thing that can be said is that it the legislation will be a “real solution for children.” The bill and the half-baked ideas that Zohar tossed out during the discussion, while trying to portray himself as the protector of children, are a classic example of building a slippery slope.</p> \n<p>The current law forbids the display of “sexual relations characterized by violence, abuse, contempt, humiliation or exploitation,” while the new version forbids the display of “sexual relations of any kind.” It also prohibits “the display of nudity or a human sex organ.”</p> \n<p>In the bill and during the committee discussion, what stood out was the egregious contrast between the lip service – maintaining privacy and doing no harm – and the total contempt for the industry the Knesset members are trying to police. They mobilized totally disproportionate means that could cause damage far greater than the improvement they aren’t really providing.</p> \n<p>There was a reason Gael Azriel, the Justice Ministry’s legal adviser, was alarmed when Zohar proposed sending the Population Registry to internet service providers as if Israelis' personal details were a grocery list. It’s as if one of the country’s worst information leaks ever – the leak of Population Registry data discovered in 2011 – never happened.</p> \n<p>If that’s not enough, Zohar also wants to link the database with the internet and rely on Israel’s cybersecurity expertise to ensure that somehow everything will be all right – despite countless incidents when our most personal information was poured online.</p> \n<p>Values and means</p> \n<p>During his work before the discussion, Zohar learned one very important detail: Internet service providers know, or can easily find out, your browsing history.</p> \n<p>Instead of trying to find a way to reduce this danger to privacy, Zohar has turned the issue into an excuse for any future damage to privacy – damage that’s required for the sacred goal of preventing children from seeing porn. “I’m concerned for your children too,” he told MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz).</p> \n<p>During the discussion, Zohar and MK Shuli Moalem-Refaeli (Habayit Hayehudi) said they were tired of the obstacles put up by technology experts and legal advisers. For these legislators, the technical issues are minor details that will be taken care of, and it makes no difference how.</p> \n<p>“There are people here who talk about values, and there are people here who have to translate the values into methods of implementation,” Moalem-Refaeli said. “I think that as legislators, as emissaries of the public, as leaders of the public, we’re talking about values. The value that we want to provide is to prevent children and teenagers from surfing pornographic websites.”</p> \n<p>Moalem-Refaeli thus made clear how she confuses values and means. “Preventing access to porn” isn’t a value, it’s a tool that can be used for implementing values. And by the way, on the other side of the political spectrum, values that MKs Zandberg and Dov Khenin (Joint List) are willing to fight for include gender equality and sexuality not marked by exploitation or objectification.</p> \n<p>Moalem-Refaeli and Zohar’s confusion of values with means is accompanied by a total lack of understanding of technology – not only the way the internet works but also the complexity of translating values into (a) code. And on the internet, “code is law,” as Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig wrote two decades ago.</p> \n<p>The legislators are merely trying to push their “values” and treat technology as an object waiting to serve them. They don’t understand the values in whose name they’re acting, or the complexity of the playing field on which they’re trying to impose their legislation. So we can’t expect them to provide a “solution for our children.”</p> \n<p>Opening the gates</p> \n<p>But that doesn’t seem to bother them; after all, they’re trying to protect the children. Their solution is designed not as a fence for keeping children away from harmful content, but as a threat to shame the parents. Not to mention that freedom to use the internet is a matter of freedom of expression, and the moment we’re ashamed we also remain silent.</p> \n<p>In the discussion, Zohar said that if you decide to activate the code, you’ve knocked down the fence for protecting your children. You and all the members of your household will be able to watch porn. The gate is open to you, but your children will pay the price.</p> \n<p>Zohar and a representative of telecom company Cellcom admitted that in the end, lists of “porn users” would be created, intentionally or not. And that in itself provides a huge opening for exploitation.</p> \n<p>As Nir Hirshman, a Likudnik and member of the Digital Rights Movement, warned: “You want to bring back the eavesdropping by Mapai” – a forerunner of the Labor Party. “You want a nation of informants who look over their shoulder to see who’s following them, and shady officials who have blacklists of deviants.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, an article in the business daily Calcalist suggests that Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan is reviving the so-called Facebook bill, which would let the authorities take down any content deemed potentially criminal. The authors of that legislation ignore the technological and social complexities and simply want more power to control the public debate.</p>",

        "text":["<p>To mark the 25th anniversary of “Schindler’s List,” a digitally remastered version of Steven Spielberg’s award-winning blockbuster is being rereleased Friday for one week only at over 1,000 screens in North America.</p> \n<p>Spielberg’s film won seven Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, is in the top 10 of the American Film Institute’s greatest American movies and is frequently cited as a masterwork of Holocaust cinema.</p> \n<p>The movie starred Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes, and, unusually, was shot in black and white. It was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and Nazi Party member who saved nearly 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by providing them with employment in his enamelware and munitions factories. He was later recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations – a title bestowed on gentiles who risked their lives to save Jews during the war – by Israel’s Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem.</p> \n<p>The poster advertising the restored version of the 195-minute film bears the tagline “A story of courage that the world needs now more than ever.” In a Q&amp;A session last week hosted by Facing History and Ourselves (a U.S. organization that trains educators who teach the Holocaust), Spielberg explained why he believes that to be true.</p> \n<p>“For me, the film is more important than ever – especially for the young people today who face a country and a world where democracy is threatened,” he said. “Some of the very things that led to the Holocaust are surfacing again. Hatred and violence, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia – these are current things in the 21st century.”</p> \n<p>But 25 years on, is the film still relevant, and would it prove so successful if it were being released for the first time today?</p> \n<p>‘Fertile ground’</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there’s a doubt that for many people, this film was their first foundational encounter with the Holocaust,” says Oren Meyers, a professor of communications at the University of Haifa who specializes in collective memory and popular culture.</p> \n<p>“It had a definitive influence on the way in which the Holocaust is remembered, especially in the West, and especially among non-Jews,” he says.</p> \n<p>Meyers believes the timing of the original release played a key role in its success. “When ‘Schindler’s List’ first came out, the Holocaust had started to become a definitive kind of identity marker for American Jews, because they could no longer agree by then on Israel or on their religious belief, so it was the one issue on which there was a consensus,” he says.</p> \n<p>Also coinciding with the film’s release, adds Meyers, was the rise of identity politics in America – which also affected the Jewish community – and the end of the Cold War. “All these things provided fertile ground for the film’s success,” he says.</p> \n<p>Isaac Zablocki, director of film programs at the JCC in Manhattan, is reluctant to use the term in reference to the Holocaust but believes a key factor behind the success of “Schindler’s List” was that it made the greatest tragedy of modern history “digestible.”</p> \n<p>“Spielberg just knows how to tell a story,” says Zablocki, who organizes an annual film festival in New York dedicated to Holocaust rescuers. “He knows how to reach an audience, he knows how to create drama and he knows how to make a film exciting and engaging.”</p> \n<p>“Schindler’s List” was certainly not the first film to address the role of rescuers in the Holocaust, but, according to Zablocki, “nothing had ever been done at that level before.</p> \n<p>“It’s interesting that Spielberg, as a Jewish director, chose that perspective,” he says, “and it could be that that’s what gave him an edge at the time.”</p> \n<p>“Schindler’s List” was a box office hit, earning more than $320 million worldwide (including $96 million in North America). It also drew considerable praise from critics at the time. Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, for example, the late Roger Ebert declared it Spielberg’s best film, “brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen.” Crowning it the best historical drama ever about the Holocaust, The New Yorker’s Stephen Schiff predicted that “Schindler’s List” would “take its place in cultural history and remain there.”</p> \n<p>But the film was not immune to criticism. Those who did not like it often cited its Hollywood-like “happy ending,” noting that most European Jews did not enjoy the fate of those on Schindler’s famous list. Among the film’s fiercest critics was Claude Lanzmann, the French filmmaker and creator of the nine-hour documentary “Shoah,” which featured only testimonies from Holocaust survivors and was released to critical acclaim in 1985.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Washington Post in 1999, Lanzmann (who passed away in July), called Spielberg’s film “an absolute distortion of historical truth.” He explained: “It is not what happened to the vast majority of Jews. The truth is extermination. Death wins.”</p> \n<p>But the film’s uplifting ending is also why audiences loved it so much, says Mimi Ash, acting director of the visual center at Yad Vashem. “I do think that’s probably part of its success, because it made it easier, as it were, to connect to the film.”</p> \n<p>Unconventional lead character</p> \n<p>Ash tends to believe, though, that a bigger factor in the film’s success was the fact it was based on such an unconventional character. “Here’s a man who was a Nazi, a hedonist, a profiteer, a man who loved women and booze,” she notes. “He just wasn’t the stereotypical, saintly rescuer. He shocks and surprises you. Sometimes the film has been criticized for focusing on a non-Jew – but I think that’s precisely what makes it so powerful. He’s a real human being, like the rest of us.”</p> \n<p>Meyers concurs that the choice of protagonist may help explain why “Schindler’s List” did so well.</p> \n<p>“When you look at moviegoers – and I’m talking mainly about non-Jews – no one wants to identify with the perpetrators,” he says. “At the same time, it doesn’t seem comfortable to identify with the victims, who are passive and helpless in many ways – and neither do you want to think of yourself as an idle bystander. So the character of Schindler was very helpful in this sense, because it gave people the ability to identify with someone who took action.”</p> \n<p>He’s not sure the film would have been as successful if it were released today, though.</p> \n<p>“Part of its success had to do with the reputation and the weight Spielberg carried back then,” says Meyers, co-author of “Communicating Awe: Media Memory and Holocaust Commemoration” (Palgrave Macmillan). “I’m not sure he’s in the same place he was 25 years ago.”</p> \n<p>Meyers believes some of Spielberg’s artistic choices would attract more criticism today, including the casting of English-speaking actors (“with vague accents”) in key roles rather than Polish-, Yiddish- and German-speakers.</p> \n<p>Zablocki is convinced the initial release of “Schindler’s List” marked the end of an era in Holocaust cinema. “It was the last of its kind in many ways,” he says. “It was a very straightforward black-and-white story, a story of good against evil – the kind Spielberg knows how to do really well. Most of the Holocaust films that have come out since have more of a twist to them. That’s because audiences are more cynical today, even when it comes to the Holocaust.”</p> \n<p>This is also why no subsequent Holocaust movie has achieved the same degree of success, in his view. “When you’re dealing with subtleties, more nuance and a deeper look into human nature, you’re bound to lose part of your audience,” says Zablocki.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Lebanon is currently embroiled in a digging scandal. Not the digging of tunnels, but of water wells.</p> \n<p>The last UN survey, in 2012, found that more than 60,000 unlicensed wells had been dug in Lebanon, plus another 20,000 that were licensed by the state. In the almost seven years that have passed since then, thousands of additional wells have been dug, most of them unlicensed.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A Hezbollah blitzkrieg: Tunnels on Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Almost every new residential building in the capital includes a well, and not to raise its value on the real estate market. Anyone who doesn’t have a well is periodically forced to buy water from tankers controlled by the “water mafia.”</p> \n<p>The mafia sets the price, and nobody has any power to complain. That’s because the water mafia, just like the “electricity mafia” that has taken over the installation of generators in Beirut, has protectors in the government, who make sure they get paid on the side.</p> \n<p>“Nobody can supervise the illegal wells, because they aren’t registered,” said the head of Beirut’s water department, Jean Gebran, in an interview with the Lebanese news site Al Moudon. And without supervision, it’s also impossible to know what the quality of the water is, how polluted it is or how it can be purified.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; IDF reveals it found another Hezbollah tunnel crossing into Israel, asks UN to help destroy it&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Anyone who can afford it fills his house with mineral water,” a Lebanese man wrote on his Facebook page this week. “The poor have in any case already gotten used to pollution.”</p> \n<p>But mineral water isn’t cheap. In cafes and restaurants, a bottle sells for more than $2 – though that’s less than coffee, which can reach $8 or even more.</p> \n<p>“Two issues interest us now, electricity and the cost of living,” a Lebanese journalist, who can’t be named lest he be indicted for the crime of “normalization” with Israel, said in an email to Haaretz. “Hezbollah’s tunnels are your problem, not ours. What happens down south doesn’t interest anyone, unless war breaks out.”</p> \n<p>Admittedly, Israel’s discovery of the tunnels and its efforts to seal them have hit the headlines. But aside from the water and electricity crises, ordinary Lebanese are much more interested in the vicissitudes of domestic politics, which have already delayed the establishment of a new government for the last six months.</p> \n<p>The latest hot story, which threatened to ignite a violent armed brawl that could have escalated into a civil war, as Hezbollah warned, began with a video clip. The clip showed Wiam Wahhab, the leader of the Druze party Arab Unification, cursing Prime Minister Saad Hariri and his father, Rafik Hariri, who was assassinated in 2005, though without naming either of them.</p> \n<p>Wahhab has denied that his curses were in fact aimed at the Hariris, but the Lebanese don’t need any explanations. Saad Hariri, at least, understood that he and his father were the targets and demanded that Wahhab be indicted for insulting him and the country.</p> \n<p>The chief prosecutor hastened to obey the prime minister’s order and summoned Wahhab for questioning. But Wahhab – whose party belongs to the March 8 bloc led by Hezbollah (other members include the Amal party, the Lebanese Democratic Party and El Marada) and who has strong ties with Syrian President Bashar Assad – never dreamed of obeying this summons.</p> \n<p>Hariri didn’t give up. Last Saturday, he ordered the domestic security agency’s intelligence branch to bring Wahhab in for questioning – and thereby opened the gates of hell.</p> \n<p>An armed force of 150 soldiers deployed around the village of Jahlieh, where Wahhab lives, to arrest the former minister, who is also very close to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The commander of the force personally went to the village mukhtar to ask him to summon Wahhab.</p> \n<p>While the mukhtar was explaining to the commander that Wahhab wasn’t home, heavy exchanges of fire erupted between the soldiers and Wahhab’s supporters, who sought to prevent his arrest. One of Wahhab’s bodyguards, Mohammed Abu Diab, was killed in the shootout.</p> \n<p>The situation would have exploded with a bang had the commander not decided to retreat from the village. But the bedlam didn’t end there.</p> \n<p>Wahhab accused Hariri of having been sent by Saudi Arabia to murder him – a charge the Saudi Embassy in Beirut naturally denied. According to one of Wahhab’s associates, there’s no way to explain “this illegal assault on the village, which was unprecedented in its scope” except as an assassination attempt.</p> \n<p>Admittedly, it’s hard to recall any precedent for such a showy arrest of a senior politician. Even Hariri’s associates consider this an unnecessary move that harmed the prime minister.</p> \n<p>But this wasn’t just an arrest sparked by a personal insult. In Lebanon’s rococo politics, stories are never that simple.</p> \n<p>Shortly before the arrest, Wahhab had organized a long convoy of cars packed with dozens of his armed supporters that drove toward Moukhtara, the hometown of Walid Jumblatt. The latter, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party, is considered the Druze community’s preeminent political leader. Wahhab, a bitter political rival of Jumblatt’s, wanted to mount a show of force and prove that he could appear in Jumblatt’s territory and challenge his leadership over the Chouf Mountains, the Druze heartland.</p> \n<p>Jumblatt, who supports Hariri, immediately declared that “Moukhtara is a red line” – meaning if someone wants war, he’ll get it. This threat wasn’t aimed solely at Wahhab, but also at Hezbollah, Wahhab’s political partner.</p> \n<p>Jumblatt, incidentally, is convinced that Wahhab is an agent employed by Assad to create a schism in the Druze community, or at least reduce Jumblatt’s influence. Though Assad has plenty to keep him busy at home, he evidently hasn’t forgotten to tend to Syria’s future in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Then came the arrest itself, which left Hezbollah with two options. Either it could exploit the incident to heat up the political arena, send its forces to protect Wahhab, confront the government forces and set Lebanon on fire, or it could try to calm the situation. Nasrallah chose the second option.</p> \n<p>“We’ve saved Lebanon from civil war,” the organization declared. “We were the main driver of the political moves that prevented an escalation in Jahlieh.”</p> \n<p>There’s no reason to doubt this. Not long after the battle in Jahlieh, Jumblatt, who is no fan of Hezbollah, sent a delegation to the organization’s headquarters in Beirut’s Dahiyeh neighborhood to say that he and his party had no part in the attack on Wahhab and the killing of his bodyguard.</p> \n<p>But he also has to maintain his relationship with Hariri. Therefore, he gave full backing to the decision to arrest Wahhab.</p> \n<p>The person who wasn’t in any rush to intervene was Lebanese President Michel Aoun. On one hand, he’s considered Hezbollah’s ally. But on the other, he accuses the organization of thwarting the establishment of a government, at a time when Lebanon needs a government urgently to make critical economic decisions and extricate the country from its severe crisis.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah was furious over what it termed the president’s “indifference” toward the incident and is already trying to determine whether Aoun plans to betray it later on. Paranoia is essential for any Lebanese politician, and Nasrallah is no exception.</p> \n<p>If he doesn’t manage to form a bloc of 11 ministers (out of a total of 30), he won’t be able to dictate the government’s agenda. That could theoretically make him irrelevant – not only to Lebanon, but also to Iran and, to a lesser extent, Syria. But the latter, unlike Iran, could build a base of influence for itself in Lebanon even without Nasrallah.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah, which in the early 1990s debated whether to enter politics at all, can no longer survive without it. Politics has become its principal source of power, for which it has been forced to pay a heavy price in blood, including by participating in Syria’s civil war.</p> \n<p>The battle in Jahlieh, which is shaking the Lebanese political world, shows the diplomatic acrobatics in which Hezbollah must engage to navigate its political path. Who should it support and who should it accuse? What narrative should it create? Should it use force or diplomacy? What can it gain from either decision?</p> \n<p>Nothing is self-evident in a country where yesterday’s allies become today’s traitors – where a Christian president who fought the Syrians and was therefore exiled from his country for 15 years subsequently became Hezbollah’s ally; where the Druze leader, Jumblatt, has reversed course repeatedly in his relations with Syria; and where the prime minister, who was supported by Saudi Arabia and also forced to resign by it, continues to conduct political negotiations with Hezbollah over forming a government.</p> \n<p>During a week when Israel was convinced that Nasrallah was dumbstruck over the exposure of Hezbollah’s tunnels, he was actually busy with a different issue of far greater importance to him. At least judging by the videos Israel has released, these tunnels – which after years of digging should have already been finished, fully equipped and ready to go – look like a project that was abandoned.</p> \n<p>Beirut is currently Hezbollah’s battlefield, and it intends to emerge victorious.</p>",

The official added that Iranian funds funneled for that purpose have decreased thanks to U.S. sanctions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The Israel Defense Forces is the only army in the world operating against the Iranian military.

A large crowd, some in Nazi uniforms, was parading in the Ukrainian city of L’viv to commemorate the establishment of a militia loyal to Hitler.</p> \n<p>“Division Galicia - the heroes of Ukraine,” the marchers chanted as they walked.</p> \n<p>As head of one of Ukraine’s leading Jewish advocacy groups, Dolinsky was livid at the idea of celebrating Nazi collaboration. For the same reason, he could try to do something about it.</p> \n<p>“When the government, state and civil society start to promote these organizations as heroes and those who fought for Ukrainian independence and whitewash their participation in the Holocaust actively and aggressively, I decided that my obligation and duty was to speak out against this,” Dolinsky told The Forward. “This is a denial of basic moral sense.”</p> \n<p>Read more:&nbsp;Russia Deploys New Laser Weapon Aimed at U.S. Allies in Response to Trump's Nuclear Ultimatum&nbsp;|&nbsp;U.S. 'Preparing to Sail Warship' Into Black Sea Amid Ukraine-Russia Tensions</p> \n<p>Today, Dolinsky, the 49-year-old director of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, is immersed in a campaign against the valorization of the SS as anti-Communist heroes.</p> \n<p>“When I was a kid someone told me that I’m a Yid,” recalled Dolinsky in a recent interview with the Forward. “I came home and asked my mom what it meant. She told me that we are Jews and we are different, don’t pay attention. For a long time afterwards I was confused and ashamed that I’m different and not like other kids.”</p> \n<p>Ukrainian Jews are about 0.1% of the country’s 44 million people.</p> \n<p>The country, which sits on the Black Sea, is bordered by Russia on its east, Belarus to the north and various eastern European countries to its west. Its relationship with Russia has dominated its politics for hundreds of years; it was a member state of the Soviet Union, and since its dissolution, the two countries have experienced periods of cooperation, tension and even armed conflict. The current government has no diplomatic relations with Russia and is actively resisting its influence. That’s where the Nazis — and Dolinsky — come in.</p> \n<p>The current anti-Russian government has enlisted history in its cause, and has embarked on an active campaign to suppress Communist symbols and to rehabilitate people and groups that fought against the Soviet Union — no matter what crimes they may have committed against the Jews.</p> \n<p>Born in 1969 to an active, if non-observant, Jewish family in the former Polish city of Lutsk in the country’s northwest, Dolinsky served two years in the Soviet Air Forces and was discharged shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> \n<p>While many Ukrainian Jews fled the country at that time, the pugnacious Dolinsky decided to stay. He said that he has been asked many times over the years, mostly by American Jews, about why he remained behind.</p> \n<p>“First of all, you were born here, you were raised here, your son was born here, your parents are buried here, so all your heritage and legacy is here and this is the country of your language and your friends and family. You can play a role here. I can be much more effective in life and in my professional activities here than anywhere abroad,” he said. Dolinsky is married, and the father of a 25-year-old son who studied in Israel and works in finance in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>It was during and just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when anything seemed possible, that he first became actively involved in efforts to rebuild his country’s moribund Jewish communal life, first serving in administrative roles in the newly established Jewish Foundation of Ukraine and the All-Ukrainian Jewish Congress before moving on to establish the Ukrainian Jewish Committee together with minor oligarch and lawmaker Oleksandr Feldman.</p> \n<p>Dolinsky is known as a firebrand, willing to speak out harshly against perceived threats to the community even when others prefer a more conciliatory approach.</p> \n<p>Asked if he finds inspiration in the example of former Anti-Defamation League leader Abe Foxman — an American crusader against anti-Semitism and bigotry more broadly — Dolinsky replied in the affirmative.</p> \n<p>“I think yes,” Dolinsky told the Forward.</p> \n<p>His high profile, bolstered by the use of social media and his close contacts with journalists, belies his small staff (only three full time employees and twenty volunteers spread across the country.) His posts on Facebook are often picked up and used as the basis of stories in outlets such as The Jerusalem Post and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. He also collaborates with the ADL, American Jewish Committee and National Coalition Supporting Soviet Jewry.</p> \n<p>Now, Dolinsky is taking aim at his government’s public awareness campaigns that praise organizations that collaborated with the Nazis and engaged in the widespread ethnic cleaning of Jews and Poles, such as the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and its militant offshoot, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.</p> \n<p>He faces a major obstacle, however, in Ukraine’s “Decommunization Laws,” which banned a slew of Communist — and some Nazi — symbols. The Decommunization Laws only list a limited number of Nazi symbols whose use is prohibited. That means by law, some are allowed, and that means Dolinsky’s quest is a bit quixotic.</p> \n<p>He believes that the Galician Division’s symbols should be included in the ban because the unit was a part of the SS and its members “all made an oath to Hitler.” And even if their logo ends up being declared legally acceptable, he isn’t deterred. “First of all, I want to bring attention to the issue of Nazi collaborators and those who perpetrated the Holocaust,” he explained.</p> \n<p>An avid reader who devours books on Jewish history, Dolinsky is one of a class of what can be called professional Jews, people whose entire Jewish identity is wrapped up in their work for the community.</p> \n<p>“It’s like an inseparable part of my life,” he said of his work. “It’s my whole life. I can’t even imagine myself outside of this. The work isn’t just work. The Jewish community isn’t about the work as a profession, it’s a passion that haunts all your life. It’s not about nine to six. It’s 24 hours, seven days a week.”</p> \n<p>As a representative of the UJC, he makes frequent media appearances, taking to the airwaves to make arguments that strike at the core of Ukraine’s self-image.</p> \n<p>In 2017 he publicly (and unsuccessfully) demanded that the local state prosecutor prosecute organizers of the SS march for their “malicious and demonstrative violation” of the law. Volodymyr Viatrovych, Dolinsky’s longtime nemesis and the official in charge of implementing Ukraine’s national memory policy, maintains that that the Galicia Division’s symbols are not legally problematic.</p> \n<p>And while many Ukraine scholars are critical of Viatrovych’s glorification of Nazi collaborators, most say he’s right about what the Decommunization Laws do and do not prohibit.</p> \n<p>Refusing to accept Viatrovych’s explanations, Dolinsky escalated their dispute, publicly calling on Ukraine’s national prosecutor to bring a lawsuit against Viatrovych himself for violating the law against Nazi glorification. It was not the first time the two had tangled.</p> \n<p>Only weeks earlier, Dolinsky had written a caustic op-ed in The New York Times in which he accused the Ukrainians of “whitewashing” history and linked such revisionism to a growing “climate of anti-Semitism.” In response, Viatrovych took to Facebook to accuse Dolinsky of making up Ukrainian anti-Semitism and selling it “in the country and abroad to everyone who will pay for it,” calling him even worse than those who “made money by hiding Jews from Nazi persecution.”</p> \n<p>Given their history and diametrically opposite points of view, it is unsurprising that Dolinsky would end up ratcheting up the conflict. While not suing Viatrovych himself, Dolinsky is backing a lawsuit against him alleging that Viatrovych, in his capacity as a civil servant, violated a Ukrainian law prohibiting him from publicly interpreting the law. There is a Ukrainian law prohibiting civil servants from issuing pronouncements on legal issues that are in the jurisdiction of the courts, and Dolinsky believes that by claiming the SS Galician Division’s symbols are legal, Viatrovych has broken that law.</p> \n<p>Several Ukrainian Jewish groups, including the Jewish Confederation of Ukraine, have expressed support for Dolinsky’s efforts, although privately some have expressed doubts about his harsh rhetoric and confrontational style.</p> \n<p>“Some people think he’s too confrontational and uses intemperate language. The message gets lost,” he said one longtime observer of Ukrainian Jewry who spoke to the Forward on condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>But Dolinsky says that he is compelled to continue.</p> \n<p>“When you say the guy who murdered a Jew is a hero, this is the second murder of Jews,” he said, explaining that whitewashing the legacy of those who slaughtered Jews is tantamount to killing them all over again.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

        "text":["<p>Unique locations for screening films are now a feature of several international film festivals. But it’s hard to imagine a better place to view a documentary on a depopulated Palestinian village in Israel than the ruins of the village itself.</p> \n<p>It’s also hard to imagine a location more likely to raise the hackles of Israel’s culture minister, Miri Regev. Regev is already no fan of the festival that will be showing Michel Khleifi’s “Ma’aloul Celebrates Its Destruction” (1985). The screening is set for Saturday in what is now a Jewish National Fund pine forest 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from Nazareth, but it was a village of more than 600 Muslim and Christian Palestinians before 1948.</p> \n<p>The event is the centerpiece of the fourth Zochrot 48mm Film Festival, which aims to “bring together cinematic works dealing with the Nakba and the return of Palestinian refugees.” Zochrot is an Israeli nongovernmental organization founded in 2002 to “promote awareness of the Palestinian Nakba, the 1948 Palestinian exodus,” seeking “to commemorate, witness, acknowledge, and repair.”</p> \n<p>Since the festival’s inception, Regev – and her fellow Likudnik and predecessor as culture minister, Limor Livnat – have tried to derail it, threatening to cut state subsidies to Cinemateque art houses that host films in the event.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Why are countless Palestinian photos and films buried in Israeli archives?</p> \n<p>The “Ma’aloul” showing is the first screening in the festival’s tribute to Khleifi, a trailblazer in bringing the Palestinian perspective to world screens.</p> \n<p>His 1987 film “Wedding in Galilee” was the first feature by a Palestinian director to be screened at Cannes, where it won the International Critics’ Prize, and his 1995 effort “Tale of the Three Jewels” was the first feature ever filmed in the Gaza Strip. His documentaries were some of the first to capture how the events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have affected the lives of individual Palestinians, with an emphasis on women.</p> \n<p>“He’s a pioneer that Israeli filmgoers need to see – not enough of them know about him. He’s truly one of the greatest Palestinian filmmakers,” said Natasha Dudinski, the festival’s artistic director who came up with the idea to show the film in Ma’aloul.</p> \n<p>“Tours are a big part of Zochrot …. After I saw Michel’s film about Ma’aloul, I immediately thought we should tour the site as part of the festival, and I had the idea of screening it in the church, which is so impressive.”</p> \n<p>The church is one of three buildings that remain standing in the village. During the 1947-49 War of Independence, the village’s Muslim and Christian residents came under fire by Israeli forces, and its residents were forced to leave. Most left for neighboring Nazareth after it was declared a closed military zone. They expected to return to their homes, but the village was bulldozed and declared state land under the Absentee Property Law – even though many of the residents hadn’t left the country and only lived a short distance away.</p> \n<p>Khleifi’s film chronicles how Ma’aloul’s former residents would visit each year in the ‘50s and ‘60s, taking along their children and grandchildren. These excursions would take place on Israeli Independence Day – the one day the country’s military administration, which governed the Arab minority during Israel’s first two decades, let the villagers travel to Ma’aloul.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The film shows the abandoned church as a scarred shell covered with graffiti, and sometimes used as a cowshed. In the decades since, a nonprofit group has been created to renovate the church, and with the JNF’s permission the place has been rebuilt from the ruin seen in the film.</p> \n<p>Much of the Marxist</p> \n<p>Khleifi’s family wasn’t from Ma’aloul but he grew up with its former residents in Nazareth. Born in 1950, he moved to Belgium in 1970 to study film and settled there, returning often for extended stays while making his films.</p> \n<p>“There were years when I was in Nazareth more than I was in Belgium,” Khleifi, now 67, told Haaretz by phone, adding that he thought it was “wonderful” and historic that he was being honored in Israel.</p> \n<p>“It is a very, very important event. I think it’s late and overdue,” he said, adding that since he began making his films in the ‘80s, “I have been seen by Israelis as the enemy. But I think I’m a very gentle enemy …. I’m anti-violence and against militarism – I’ve never held a weapon. I’m against ethnocentrism – there’s still much of the Marxist in me.”</p> \n<p>Either way, Khleifi’s films cast a harshly critical eye on Israel while humanizing Palestinians on the world stage.</p> \n<p>His most acclaimed work, “Wedding in Galilee,” tells the story of a village mukhtar in 1948 who asks to hold his son’s wedding despite the military curfew. The authorities agree on condition that the military commander and his officers be invited as guests of honor – their incongruous presence becomes a metaphor for their presence on the land.</p> \n<p>As The New York Times wrote in 1988, the film is “lyrical and extravagantly detailed when portraying the Palestinians. But because Mr. Khleifi turns simplistic and leaden whenever he points his camera at an Israeli, always viewed as the one-dimensional enemy, his often dazzling first feature is diminished by his insistently narrow vision.”</p> \n<p>While declaring himself an artist, not a political activist,&nbsp;Khleifi has fought on the cultural front for official recognition of the Palestinian national identity. At Cannes he pushed back against the organizers’ reluctance to label his films as being submitted by “Palestine” – they ultimately agreed to call them coproductions of Belgium and Palestine.</p> \n<p>Khleifi says his films depict the Palestinian struggle as a battle to recognize humanity and collective suffering while making sure individual lives and stories are never lost. “You can’t be free if others aren’t free,” he said. “That has always been my guiding principle …. And you can’t ever be just an Israeli or a Palestinian – your individuality has to be honored.”</p> \n<p>Sense of urgency</p> \n<p>When Khleifi began making films in the ‘80s, it was a radical act to show the humanity of Palestinians by telling their stories, and doing this through cinema was highly challenging. Looking back, he says it was “very, very” hard to get his earliest features made, particularly his Gaza feature, when “we were literally making our movie in the line of fire. People would look at us carrying around our film equipment like we were crazy.”</p> \n<p>He says he was driven in those years by a sense of urgency that the world he was putting on film – like Ma’aloul – would soon no longer exist. In the ‘80s and 90s, he says, “I knew what I was filming was changing and would soon disappear .... I was right.”</p> \n<p>He is thrilled that so many Palestinians have followed in his footsteps. At the 2018 Cannes festival there was a Palestine Film Institute pavilion offering 10 films – five features and five documentaries – to international distributors. The growth of Palestinian cinema he has witnessed “is a miracle … given the situation of the Palestinians …. That so many films are being made is a wonderful and amazing thing.”</p> \n<p>Unlike the other films in the festival, the tribute to Khleifi featuring two of his films won’t take place at the Tel Aviv Cinemateque – even though it has resisted Regev’s threats and continues to host the Zochrot festival. Instead the screenings will be at the Left Bank Cine Club.</p> \n<p>Khleifi resisted Cinemateque screenings for a reason that paradoxically parallels Regev’s objections to the place hosting the festival: They don’t want the films shown at a facility subsidized by the Israeli government.</p> \n<p>Khleifi says he knows that in today’s atmosphere against normalization and amid the strength of the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement, many Palestinian filmmakers would refuse to take part in an event in Israel no matter where the film were screened.</p> \n<p>“I can understand them and I don’t have a problem with it. But at my age, with my experience, I know who I am and I know exactly what I’m doing,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Nobody can give me lessons on what I should do. I am happy and proud that until the end of my life I will remain an internationalist who always tries to look at the other the way I look at myself. People can say what they want.”</p> \n<p>After living in Europe for nearly 50 years, he says, he understands the effect that the “terrible events” of the Holocaust had on the Jewish people, but he believes that “Zionist colonialism contradicts Jewish values” and “I don’t understand how the Jewish world isn’t rebelling against it.”</p> \n<p>“I think that the two societies – Israeli and Palestinian – are traumatized …. We have to understand the trauma of the Israeli and Jewish society and the Israeli society needs to understand ours, but they don’t want to understand that we too live in trauma,” he said. “You can’t pit my trauma against your trauma. They shouldn’t be in competition.”</p> \n<p>The conflict “is a terrible thing,” he added. “We live in the 21st century. How much longer should we continue like this?”</p> \n<p>Dudinski recalled that when she first told Khleifi that the festival wanted to pay homage to his work, the law declaring Israel the nation-state of the Jewish people had just been passed, and that while he was pleased to receive the invitation, he hesitated to accept it.</p> \n<p>She said Khleifi was “very distressed and very depressed” over the law and said he was taking it very personally.</p> \n<p>“He told me that he wasn’t sure whether it was appropriate” for his films about the lives and pain of Palestinians living in the Israeli state to be screened.</p> \n<p>Her response: “This is exactly the kind of atmosphere in which they need to be shown.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>President Donald Trump announced Friday he’s nominating State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p> \n<p>“Heather Nauert will be nominated,” Trump said Friday before departing the White House on Marine One for an event in Kansas City. “She’s very talented, very smart, very quick, and I think she’s going to be respected by all.”</p> \n<p>If she is confirmed by the Senate, Nauert, a former Fox News Channel reporter who had little foreign policy experience before becoming State Department spokeswoman, will replace Nikki Haley. Haley, a former South Carolina governor, announced in October that she would step down at the end of this year. Nauert would be a leading administration voice on Trump’s foreign policy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump told reporters last month that Nauert was “excellent,” adding, “She’s been a supporter for a long time.”</p> \n<p>Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, welcomed Nauert's nomination, adding that he has &quot;no doubt the cooperation between our countries will keep on strengthening during her tenure.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Nikki Haley will be missed most sorely by Netanyahu and right-wing U.S. Jews&nbsp;■&nbsp;In blow to U.S. and Israel, UN fails to pass anti-Hamas resolution</p> \n<p>Also Friday, Trump said he had chosen former U.S. Attorney General William Barr to once again lead the Justice Department, a role that is in charge of the probe into Russian election interference and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign.</p> \n<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Barr would take over from Matthew Whitaker, who has been serving in an acting capacity since Trump forced out Jeffrey Sessions a month ago. Whitaker had been Sessions’ chief of staff.</p> \n<p>Plucked from Fox by the White House to serve as State Department spokeswoman, Nauert catapulted into the upper echelons of the agency’s hierarchy when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired in March and replaced with Mike Pompeo. Nauert was then appointed acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs and was for a time the highest-ranking woman and fourth highest-ranking official in the building.</p> \n<p>Nauert, who did not have a good relationship with Tillerson and had considered leaving the department, told associates at the time she was taken aback by the promotion offer and recommended a colleague for the job. But when White House officials told her they wanted her, she accepted.</p> \n<p>That role gave her responsibilities far beyond the news conferences she held in the State Department briefing room. She oversaw public diplomacy in Washington and all of the roughly 275 overseas U.S. embassies, consulates and other posts. She was in charge of the Global Engagement Center that fights extremist messaging from the Islamic State group and others, and she has a seat on the U.S. Agency for Global Media that oversees government broadcast networks such as Voice of America.</p> \n<p>Just 18 months ago, she wasn’t even in government.</p> \n<p>Nauert was a breaking news anchor on Trump’s favorite television show, “Fox &amp; Friends,” when she was tapped to be the face and voice of the administration’s foreign policy.

        "text":["<p>What a difference two days make. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as he came across on Tuesday evening at the Defense Ministry, surrounded by technical props and with the chief of staff at his side, didn’t recall in the least the Bibi of Sunday evening, after the recommendation by the police concerning Case 4000 had been made public.</p> \n<p>At the Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony with Likud activists on Sunday, the suspect in three bribery cases spoke from the depths of his heart, out of his fear of conviction. His speech was not as well organized as usual and he projected pressure, apprehension. The premier’s blistering attack on the outgoing police commissioner reflected a loss of control. Roni Alsheich is yesterday’s war. There’s no point wasting ammunition on a rival who’s basically extinct, except perhaps to boost the morale of party stalwarts who are starting to feel a bit nervous about their dear leader’s prospects of extricating himself from the mire.</p> \n<p>At the Kirya defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, on the evening of a day that made every Israeli heart skip a beat – “The IDF has launched an operation” – and ended in an anticlimax, he was in his element: Mr. Security, and this time officially. The launching of the engineering project by the Israel Defense Forces along the northern border intended to neutralize Hezbollah’s terror tunnels (something that is already routine in the Gaza Strip area) was transformed by the world’s propaganda champ into a masterful piece of work that bolstered the essential narrative for his election victory. The message: Israel is on the eve of dramatic security decisions, and no one but he can lead the country in the existential era that looms.</p> \n<p>His text was precise and focused. “Citizens of Israel,” he said. “There is more here than meets the eye. What you’ve seen now is only a small part of the overall picture of our operations and of the operations we are preparing in order to ensure Israel’s security – in all sectors.” He delivered each sentence slowly, emphatically, with pauses in the right places – reminiscent of what Golda Meir once said about Anwar Sadat: “I don’t know if he deserves the Nobel, but he definitely should get an Oscar.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s aides uploaded to his Twitter account a clip with his fateful declarations, garnishing them with a dramatic musical soundtrack that recalls Hollywood sci-fi flicks like “Armageddon.” Just before Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck lift off into space on a mission to blow up the monstrous asteroid, the violins and the cymbals pound us with a rising crescendo. (The same clip with Netanyahu’s statement in English was devoid of special effects; just goes to show what the prime minister’s new-media people think of the Israeli audience.)</p> \n<p>When in Israel’s 70 years of existence has there not been more than meets the eye? When weren’t operations planned and executed by the thousands, all aimed at ensuring Israel’s security? Since taking over as defense minister, Netanyahu has already delivered two angry-prophet speeches. The first, dubbed the “speech of the sacrifice,” announced forthcoming military operations that were liable to exact victims, because of which he ostensibly preferred a truce over a confrontation with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Security cabinet ministers who knew what was coming, guffawed. This week, after the second address, someone wondered whether Netanyahu is prime minister and defense minister, or head of Israel’s promo department.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has figured out the formula for penetrating voters’ hearts and minds in a way that no one before him has. His system is to plant seeds of fear and terror, which he then systematically cultivates and irrigates by way of a Chinese water-torture method of piling threat upon concern, danger upon complication, fright upon panic. There’s no hope in his lexicon, no future, and the only dream is a bad dream. Nor is there any light at the end other than the blinding flash of missiles.</p> \n<p>It’s said that Netanyahu has fallen in love with the defense portfolio – there appears to be a lot to become enamored of – and he isn’t missing an opportunity to turn the position into a political bonanza. Many of his predecessors in the Defense Ministry liked having their picture taken in a boulder-strewn, untamed landscape in the company of photogenic IDF officers and soldiers. He too hasn’t abstained from that. But two blood-sweat-and-tears speeches live on prime time within just three weeks? Only Bibi can get away with that. Avigdor Lieberman, who resigned as defense minister last month, must be eating his heart out in his armchair in Nokdim, the settlement where he resides. His term of 30 moons had faded from the collective memory even before Defense Ministry staffers could change the copper plaque on the door of the minister’s bureau.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has gone through three defense ministers in the past decade. Two of them, former chiefs of staff Ehud Barak and Moshe Ya’alon, were pushed out of political life and are desperately seeking a way back in. None of them even tickles the soles of his shoes. The big question in the looming election will be: Will the third former chief of staff who’s now warming up on the sidelines, namely Benny Gantz, who is looking like the wild card in the race, succeed not only in tickling but also in scratching him?</p> \n<p>Emergency merger</p> \n<p>The 45-day extension that the government was given to legislate a new army draft law will run out on January 16, 2019. From conversations with senior officials in the ultra-Orthodox parties, it emerges that the law that Deputy Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, MK Meir Porush and their rabbis hope for won't materialize in the next five weeks.  The conclusion is that the Knesset will be dissolved by the end of January, and the election will be held in the latter half of May, immediately after Independence Day and the Eurovision song competition. In the past it has been claimed that this is the timing Netanyahu is aiming for, for reasons related to the attorney general's expected decisions regarding the corruption probes and the exposure the prime minister will get at the Memorial Day and Independence Day ceremonies. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Meanwhile, preparations for the election are underway. On Sunday, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation is expected to vote on the so-called Gideon Sa'ar bill, which would limit the president's discretion in deciding who should form the government.  The bill's expected approval will appease Netanyahu, at least when it comes to President Reuven Rivlin. Netanyahu has gotten it into his head that Rivilin would do anything to deny him the mandate to form a government. This is Netanyahu's problem: He projects his dubious values on others, and thus causes himself unnecessary anxiety and existential fear.  After that, Netanyahu will be free to tend to other matters. In private talks, he expects that at the last minute, Gantz and his Knesset ticket will join forces with Zionist Union and former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon, turning into a force to be reckoned with. How would one deal with such a scenario? Officials close to the premier have recently put out feelers regarding a potential emergency merger with Habayit Hayehudi. The idea wasn't rejected outright.</p> \n<p>Public insecurity</p> \n<p>The appointment of former Israel Police Maj. Gen. Moshe Edri as the force’s next commissioner was supposed to be a corrective experience for Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, after the traumatic failure to get Gal Hirsch appointed to that post three-and-a-half years ago. By now, Erdan is familiar with the apparatus, the procedures, the land mines and the pitfalls, as well as with the dangers that lurk for candidates hoping to become police chief. This second effort was supposed to end in a dizzying success, not a loud crash.</p> \n<p>In August 2015, Erdan named IDF Brig. Gen. (res.) Gal Hirsch as his candidate for the top spot at the police force. We all remember how that ended. It was actually Prime Minister Netanyahu who appointed Roni Alsheich – and lived to regret it. This time, however, it will be harder for Netanyahu to intervene so as to advance the selection of a commissioner who’s on his wavelength. The prime minister can’t be involved in any direct way, because he himself is a suspect. If he operates behind the scenes, he might be found out. He has enough investigations to contend with as it is.</p> \n<p>With Edri, Erdan apparently did the proper homework vis-&agrave;-vis the Justice Ministry. He received a green light to proceed with the appointment. By the way, it is odd that his team didn’t discover the State Comptroller’s Report from two years ago that described the “culture of lies” that prevailed in the traffic division while it was under Edri’s command. He personally cancelled, on a wholesale basis, traffic violations and other fines earned by senior officers in the force, friends of his. Free advice, to future appointers: At times like this, Google can be quite useful. It offers access to a treasure trove of information.</p> \n<p>But even without the wonders of the search engine, this appointment was stillborn. The most minimal due diligence would have ruled it out from the get-go. As the days passed, Edri proved to be a huge can of worms. The death blow was dealt by Amir Oren of the Walla news site, who reported that the candidate for police chief didn’t bother to tell anyone that the technician who administered his polygraph also advised him as to how to cope with the test. With sketchy norms like those, with such a lack of integrity, he should show some respect and go find himself a regular job.</p> \n<p>Erdan’s choice of Edri, currently his director general, was natural: They had worked together, so there was mutual trust, and perhaps friendship and mutual esteem, too. After Alsheich – who couldn’t have cared less about the minister he was accountable to and made no effort to hide his attitude – Erdan hoped for better and less frustrating days alongside someone like Edri.</p> \n<p>His second successive failure in what’s considered the crowning moment of the public security portfolio – appointing the commander of the police – hit Erdan in his soft belly: his judgment. He’s a veteran politician – this is his fifth Knesset term, he’s been a minister almost 10 years. But he hasn’t yet accumulated the mass of public regard that’s crucial for anyone who’s striving to catapult to the national leadership after Netanyahu (an “after” that’s getting closer).The Edri fiasco and the earlier Hirsch screw-up have implications for Erdan’s understandable ambition to reach the top of the pyramid when the time comes. And there were other snafus, too, such as his hasty statement about “a definite ramming attack” – which hasn’t yet been proven to be the case – during the evacuation of the Bedouin community of Umm al-Hiran. Erdan could have forged himself a leadership image and consolidated his public status if he’d taken a contrarian stance to Netanyahu in regard to the investigations of the premier. He chose a different route, because his gaze is focused on internal Likud politics. The protection Erdan gave police investigators who were subjected to frequent verbal abuse by Netanyahu and his cohorts, MKs and confidants of various stripes, was flaccid and glaringly insufficient. We didn’t hear a peep out of him after the nervous appearance of the suspect from Balfour Street at Kfar Maccabiah on Sunday, a large portion of which was devoted to defaming the police, and was delivered as if the one speaking was the most notorious criminal defendant.</p> \n<p>Erdan’s cantankerous and childish reaction to the decision of the Goldberg vetting committee, which disqualified Edri last Thursday night, also didn’t serve his cause. It paved the way for an ugly offensive by problematic types such as former police Maj. Gen. Uri Bar-Lev or, by contrast, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who, in the heat of their burning ambition to topple the gatekeepers, insulted and offended Eliezer Goldberg, one of the most highly regarded former justices of the Supreme Court. Now, when it’s clear to everyone with eyes in his head that Edri is unworthy to be the top cop, or any cop – an apology would be in order.</p> \n<p>The government’s term is approaching its end, along with Erdan’s as public security minister. He will leave the ministry bruised and battered, clutching his head in his hands. He’ll probably be elected to a high spot in the Likud primary ahead of the next election. Likudniks like him and perhaps will want to compensate him. But his future in the next Netanyahu government looks bleak.</p> \n<p>Erdan’s relations with the imperial couple are rancid. The Balfour Street group terms him, loathingly, “traitor.” Bibi and Sara had great expectations of him: that he would contain the investigators, harass them, embitter their lives. That was never a realistic option, but in the world of the Netanyahus, when the madness takes hold, reality is blocked at the gate.</p> \n<p>The hatred of Erdan is comparable only to that which The Lady harbors for Ayelet Shaked. According to police leaks, Erdan’s testimony (as the communications minister before Netanyahu) in Case 4000, the Walla-Bezeq case, didn’t help the prime minister. Netanyahu was confronted with Erdan’s testimony in one of his interrogations. Erdan responded by saying that in his own interrogation, he had said that the prime minister had not tried to persuade him to act contrary to his policy regarding Bezeq Telecommunications. Even if that’s true, when the next government is formed – and if Bibi is the one doing the forming – Erdan will do well not to hold his breath waiting for a phone call.</p> \n<p>Unkosher behavior</p> \n<p>The defense arguments of Shaul Elovitch, the former owner of the Walla website and one of the key suspects in Case 4000, are the stuff from which political plays are written. The quotes reported by Israel Television News correspondent Amit Segal concerning pressure exerted by the prime minister of Israel on his pal and benefactor to slant news coverage on the website, are a trailer of what we can expect when the transcripts of the testimony by Nir Hefetz are published. The latter, who has turned state’s evidence, served as a gofer for the raging ruling couple. There are certainly plenty more goodies in the recordings he handed over to the police. It’ll be fun.</p> \n<p>Perhaps we will discover in that trove testimony from Israel Hayom staffers, such as the former editor in chief, Amos Regev. The Bibi freebie also racked up significant mileage as a long arm for the elimination and belittlement of political enemies of Balfour Street.</p> \n<p>The story about Netanyahu’s apparent request to Elovitch – that his site run a report stating that Gilat Bennett, wife of the leader of Habayit Hayehudi, worked as a pastry chef in non-kosher restaurants when the couple lived in New York – causes 50 shades of revulsion. Elovitch was quoted as saying that the site’s editors refused to publish the story. In a perverse and sick manner, Netanyahu had decided not just to humiliate the leader of the right-wing religious party in the eyes of his supporters, but also to besmirch him. Bennett’s wife might have kneaded dough or spread frosting at a non-kosher restaurant, and perhaps even grazed the tail of a shrimp, not to mention tasted one. For all we know, treif creatures continue crawling around the Bennetts’ residence.</p> \n<p>Everything we knew or thought we knew about the raging obsession that drives Bibi and Sara when it comes to Bennett and Shaked – from the period when they were Netanyahu’s chief of staff and bureau chief, respectively, in 2006-2007, and more recently, during their service as senior ministers in his coalition – never even approached these new realms. Netanyahu is revealed here in all his pathetic pettiness. The man who has dined in non-kosher restaurants his whole life, always at the expense of others, the man who likes to say, “Leave my wife and children alone, deal with me,” turns out to be a seventh-rate gossip-monger. It would be interesting to know whether it was his initiative to ask Elovitch to run the story, or whether he was assigned the mission by She-who-must-be-obeyed.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is a brilliant politician, and a prime minister whose head is on his shoulders when it comes to statesmanship and national security, but his legs are wallowing in sordid mire. Let’s wait for Hefetz’s testimony about Sara. Maybe we’ll discover there what kind of rumors she spread about Shaked and Bennett, whom she refused to forgive after they declined to become her abject servants in the bureau of the then-leader of the opposition. Elovitch’s testimony about the prime minister’s request will pale by comparison, making it look like a mischievous but good-hearted act.</p> \n<p>For Bennett, this whole affair couldn’t have come at a better time – while he’s still licking the wounds from the saga of his threat to resign, which ended with him skulking away, tail between his legs. Finally, the perfect opportunity arrived for him to put Bibi in his place, to shine the spotlight on him and reveal him as he really is: a small person. Not an ideologue, not an idealist. Just a vengeful character who will stoop to anything.</p> \n<p>“I feel sorry for you, Mr. Netanyahu,” Bennett hurried to tweet on Wednesday evening. What Netanyahu did was “despicable and cowardly,” he added. “Shame on you.” He demanded an apology to his wife (Netanyahu will offer one probably a minute after Bennett apologizes to Goldberg) and got in return a tweet from Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son. “Well, and you did it a million times against my mother with [Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper publisher] Noni Mozes and with every editor of every possible media outlet in the country.”</p> \n<p>A few minutes passed, and the PM’s new-media advisor, Jonathan Urich, tweeted a very similar message on his account. A few minutes later, and their comments became Likud’s official response. Not in the same words and style, but in the same spirit. It was a real-time demonstration of who’s running the show, not only in the Prime Minister’s Bureau but in his party, too. This is the food chain: Netanyahu Jr. – Urich – Likud.</p> \n<p>By the way, the author of these lines can say from personal experience that from the time that Bennett and Shaked first ventured into political life, both of them have stubbornly refused to release information about their dealings with Sara. Their lips clamped shut whenever the subject was raised. Bennett did have one famous faux pas when, in an interview, he described his relations with the Lady as being comparable to participation in a terrorism course. But when it comes to juicy stories, and they have an endless supply of them, they have both refused to share.</p> \n<p>Habayit Hayehudi’s electorate, a large portion of which is at any given moment prone to cross the lines to Likud, this week lined up en masse behind the party chairman and education minister. In the previous round, when Bennett tangled with Netanyahu over the defense minister position, presumably a subject of national importance, a majority of his voters did not back him up – they understood he was acting out of personal considerations. This time, they are 100 percent behind him.</p>",

They said his sentence should reflect a &quot;modest&quot; reduction from the four to five years they said federal guidelines would suggest.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mueller said Cohen had voluntarily provided information about his own and others' conduct on &quot;core topics under investigation&quot; and described the information &quot;credible and consistent with other evidence&quot; they had obtained.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cohen admitted to lying to congressional investigators in an attempt to minimize his efforts to secure the Kremlin's help in 2016 for a planned Trump skyscraper in Moscow. He has said he did so to stay in sync with Trump's political messaging and consulted with the White House while preparing to testify.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In addition to information on the Moscow tower project, Cohen also told Mueller about a conversation he had in November 2015 with a Russian national who offered the campaign &quot;political synergy&quot; with Russia and a meeting between Trump and Putin. Cohen did not follow up on the offer, the filing says.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Citing Cohen's cooperation, Mueller suggested the sentence for lying to Congress run concurrently with the sentence in the New York case.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Also on Friday, Mueller disclosed details of alleged lies told by Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, during interviews with prosecutors. Last month Mueller voided his plea agreement because, they said, he was not telling the truth.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They said Manafort told &quot;multiple discernible lies,&quot; including about his communications with a political consultant will alleged ties to Russian intelligence, and about interactions with Trump administration officials even after Manafort was first indicted in late 2017.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Mueller probe has infuriated Trump, who has regularly issued tweets criticizing the special counsel and his team.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The president has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia, and accuses Mueller's prosecutors of pressuring his former aides to lie about him, his election campaign and his business dealings. Russia has denied meddling.&nbsp; Friday's disclosures suggest Mueller is making progress building evidence of contacts between Russians and the Trump campaign, legal experts said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Taken as a whole, the contentions ... punctuate the point that the government has a tremendous amount of information about what went on in the campaign and what went on afterward,&quot; said Mark Zauderer, a New York-based appellate lawyer.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In new tweets on Friday, Trump accused federal investigators and senior officials of having conflicts of interest, without offering any evidence. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday that Cohen has &quot;repeatedly lied&quot; and that Manafort's case had absolutely nothing to do with the president.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the disclosures should underscore the importance of the Mueller investigation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;These legal documents outline serious and criminal wrongdoing, including felony violations of campaign finance laws at the direction of President Trump,&quot; she said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The WZO Settlement Division transferred public funds as loans to at least two settlers from the West Bank settlement of Itamar, documents obtained by Haaretz show. In exchange for the loans the settlers mortgaged plots that had been allocated to them in Itamar.</p> \n<p>However, Civil Administration maps show that the ostensibly mortgaged plots simply don’t exist. A defense official familiar with the plans confirmed that the plots are non-existent. The division denied one case and did not comment on the other.</p> \n<p>The Settlement Division is a private body that acts under the World Zionist Organization, but is wholly financed by Israeli public funds. It acts as a government agent in assigning land to Jewish settlers in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>In August 2012 the couple received a loan from the Settlement Division, in exchange for mortgaging plot 405 in Itamar. Under the mortgage agreement, the couple mortgaged “contractual and other property rights…to the debtors, the property owners, including future rights, and any money paid to the property: damages, insurance fees, rent, as detailed in the agreement.”</p> \n<p>But there is no plot 405, according to the area maps. This means the couple received a loan from public funds for mortgaging a non-existent plot.</p> \n<p>The couple lives in the Itamar region, on hill called Meshek Alumot, where they operate a dairy and hatchery and sell cheeses, yogurt and eggs. The hill is an illegal outpost and the Civil Administration issued demolition orders for it, but they have never been implemented.</p> \n<p>The husband's brother was in the headlines some time ago after he reportedly built an illegal runway on the hill.</p> \n<p>The administration’s maps show that most of the outpost structures were been built on state-run land, against the law, except for a few located in an area that isn’t under Israeli administration at all. The husband did not respond to Haaretz’s queries.</p> \n<p>Haaretz has obtained documents showing that the division has practiced this method for setting up illegal outposts before. In 2011 a couple received a loan from the division in exchange for mortgaging plot 403 in Itamar, to purchase some 100 sheep. In 2012 they mortgaged the same plot again, with the addition of 50 sheep. In 2014 they bought 10 cows and mortgaged plot 403 again. No such plot currently exists today in Civil Administration maps.</p> \n<p>The defense official confirmed this incident as well. However, it may be assumed that the couple in fact mortgaged plot 440, whose area is equal to what is marked as plot 403 in a previous map. But if the couple mortgaged plot 440, then they did not build the sheep pen they allegedly built with the loan, as the plot, on the outskirts of Itamar, is empty. The illegal outpost on which the well-known farm was built is located at a more remote location.</p> \n<p>The husband did not respond to Haaretz’ queries. But an official who knows the individuals involved told Haaretz “these methods are ancient. The practice was stopped 20 years ago.”</p> \n<p>The incident was discovered as part of a study conducted by the leftist NGO Kerem Navot. “This story exposes again the Settlement Division’s swindling ways and dirty dealings,” Kerem Navot said. He noted that it was similar to the case of Smotrich, “who received a mortgage in the Kedumim settlement for a plot that doesn’t exist. It’s obvious from that and from the other cases that this is only the tip of the iceberg of a much broader practice.”</p> \n<p>The NGO was referring to a story Haaretz published, which exposed a similar method on the division’s part in Kedumim. Bezalel Smotrich, who was later to become an MK, had been allocated a plot on which he did not build anything. Smotrich mortgaged the empty plot and built a house in another place, against the law and outside the settlement’s borders.</p> \n<p>The Settlement Division claimed that the plot the second couple had mortgaged exists, but admitted nothing had been built on it. The division said “plot 403 (that the husband mortgaged) appears in the settlement’s master plan and is within Itamar’s borders, on an area that isn’t currently built. The plot was allocated to the family. The claim that we mortgaged a fictitious property is wrong because the plot is a guarantee to the loan and if it is not repaid the plot will be seized. In any case putting a lien on the plot renders it exclusive to those who have rights on it and no use can be made of it by anyone but them or with their agreement.”</p> \n<p>The division’s spokesman noted in previous correspondence that the loan was not granted to build an illegal outpost and “as far as we know he has a seasonal contract for grazing in areas located within Itamar’s borders.” No response was given regarding plot 405, which was mortgaged by the other couple.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s chief financial officer faces U.S. accusations that she covered up her company’s links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions, a Canadian prosecutor said on Friday, arguing against giving her bail while she awaits extradition.</p> \n<p>The case against Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of Huawei [HWT.UL], stems from a 2013 Reuters report&nbsp;here&nbsp;about the company's close ties to Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd, which attempted to sell U.S. equipment to Iran despite U.S. and European Union bans, the prosecutor told a Vancouver court.</p> \n<p>U.S. prosecutors argue that Meng was not truthful to banks who asked her about links between the two firms, the court heard on Friday. If extradited to the United States, Meng would face charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, the court heard, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge.</p> \n<p>No decision was reached after nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the hearing was adjourned until Monday 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time (1800 GMT).</p> \n<p>Meng, 46, was arrested in Canada on December 1 at the request of the United States. The arrest was on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump met in Argentina with China’s Xi Jinping to look for ways to resolve an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.</p> \n<p>The news of her arrest has roiled stock markets and drawn condemnation from Chinese authorities, although Trump and his top economic advisers have downplayed its importance to trade talks after the two leaders agreed to a truce.</p> \n<p>Friday’s court hearing was intended to decide on whether Meng can post bail or if she should be kept in detention.</p> \n<p>The prosecutor opposed bail, arguing that Meng was a high flight risk with few ties to Vancouver and that her family’s wealth would mean than even a multi-million-dollar surety would not weigh heavily should she breach conditions.</p> \n<p>Meng’s lawyer, David Martin, said her prominence made it unlikely she would breach any court orders.</p> \n<p>“You can trust her,” he said. Fleeing “would humiliate and embarrass her father, whom she loves,” he argued.</p> \n<p>The United States has 60 days to make a formal extradition request, which a Canadian judge will weigh to determine whether the case against Meng is strong enough. Then it is up to Canada’s justice minister to decide whether to extradite her.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Huawei said on Friday the company has “every confidence that the Canadian and U.S. legal systems will reach the right conclusion.” The company has said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations.</p> \n<p>IRAN BUSINESS</p> \n<p>The U.S. case against Meng involves Skycom, which had an office in Tehran and which Huawei has described as one of its “major local partners” in Iran.</p> \n<p>In January 2013, Reuters reported that Skycom, which tried to sell embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran’s largest mobile-phone operator, had much closer ties to Huawei and Meng than previously known.</p> \n<p>In 2007, a management company controlled by Huawei’s parent company held all of Skycom’s shares. At the time, Meng served as the management firm’s company secretary. Meng also served on Skycom’s board between February 2008 and April 2009, according to Skycom records filed with Hong Kong’s Companies Registry.</p> \n<p>Huawei used Skycom’s Tehran office to provide mobile network equipment to several major telecommunications companies in Iran, people familiar with the company’s operations have said. Two of the sources said that technically Skycom was controlled by Iranians to comply with local law but that it effectively was run by Huawei.</p> \n<p>Huawei and Skycom were “the same,” a former Huawei employee who worked in Iran said on Friday.</p> \n<p>A Huawei spokesman told Reuters in 2013: “Huawei has established a trade compliance system which is in line with industry best practices and our business in Iran is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those of the UN. We also require our partners, such as Skycom, to make the same commitments.”</p> \n<p>U.S. CASE</p> \n<p>The United States has been looking since at least 2016 into whether Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran, Reuters reported in April.</p> \n<p>The case against Meng revolves around her response to banks, who asked her about Huawei’s links to Skycom in the wake of the 2013 Reuters report. U.S. prosecutors argue that Meng fraudulently said there was no link, the court heard on Friday.</p> \n<p>U.S. investigators believe the misrepresentations induced the banks to provide services to Huawei despite the fact they were operating in sanctioned countries, Canadian court documents released on Friday showed.</p> \n<p>The hearing did not name any banks, but sources told Reuters this week that the probe centered on whether Huawei had used HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) to conduct illegal transactions. HSBC is not under investigation.</p> \n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have also alleged that Huawei is linked to China’s government and its equipment could contain “backdoors” for use by government spies. No evidence has been produced publicly and the firm has repeatedly denied the claims.</p> \n<p>The probe of Huawei is similar to one that threatened the survival of China’s ZTE Corp (0763.HK) (000063.SZ), which pleaded guilty in 2017 to violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran. ZTE paid a $892 million penalty.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As an Israeli Turkish studies scholar, you have the added advantage of having been born and raised in Turkey, and you’ve also retained your Turkish citizenship.</p> \n<p>I grew up in Istanbul, and immigrated to Israel when I was 22 – because of Zionism. When I arrived here, I studied Hebrew in an ulpan, and then attended Tel Aviv University. As a boy, I went to a Jewish school, and later I studied political science at Istanbul University. I have friends who are Muslim Turks, Armenians, Greeks, Kurds. I’m in close touch with the Jewish community in Turkey and I go there, to visit and lecture, at least seven or eight times a year.</p> \n<p>Let’s talk a little about the Turkey of your childhood, compared to the country as it is today.</p> \n<p>The main difference is that there were no [digital] social networks in the Turkey of that time, so people weren’t exposed to the true reality. Today, the dirty laundry is exposed. When I talk to my parents, they always say, “It wasn’t like that in the Turkey we grew up in,” and I tell them that it’s not so, that they simply didn’t get to hear other opinions. There was one television channel, belonging to the state; a heavily censored press; textbooks with very clear messages. My parents simply believed that this was the reality – but in secular Turkey, too, there were people who suffered greatly. At that time, [President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan’s people, the conservatives, were incarcerated, and today they’re the ones who have incarcerated the secular people. In any case, the point is that in Turkey there isn’t really a culture of pluralism or coexistence.</p> \n<p>Only oppressor and oppressed.</p> \n<p>Whoever’s behind the steering wheel tries to run over the other. Why was Erdogan imprisoned? Because he quoted poetry. [In 1997, while mayor of Istanbul, Erdogan publicly recited a poem of arguably Islamist content; he was tried and convicted of religious incitement, and in 1999, served 120 days in prison.] The military government simply framed him. When he got out of jail, he wanted to take revenge on the Turkish army. So he forged an alliance with [the now-exiled religious leader] Fethullah Gulen and they threw the senior members of the military regime into jail. There’s always someone in jail. One time it’s the religious, another time the secular, one time it’s a supporter of Erdogan, the next time an opponent of Erdogan.</p> \n<p>What you’re describing is a governmental culture: prison as a tool to consolidate power.</p> \n<p>It’s even more than that, it’s a preventive attack. Whoever is in power feels that if he doesn’t imprison his opponents today, they might imprison him tomorrow.</p> \n<p>I hear in your words empathy, not to say sympathy, for President Erdogan.</p> \n<p>Let’s look at this phenomenon without emotions, like a case for analysis in a political science class. I say to you unequivocally: Today’s Turkey isn’t really different from the Turkey of the 1970s and 1980s. The thing is that those who are suffering today in Turkey – the secular liberals – are closer to our lifestyle, so we identify with them. Turkey was never a Swedish-style democracy. Compared to Iran, it’s a democracy; compared to Sweden, it’s perhaps not a democracy. There’s a constitution; elections are held.</p> \n<p>Though it’s not clear if their results correspond to the reality. Do you think there is election fraud, by the way?</p> \n<p>The impression I get from my friends and from the social networks is that there is. But again, that’s not unique to this period. We just hear about it more. When I was growing up in Turkey, Ataturk [Mustafa Kemal, the republic’s founder] was a demigod. I’m certain that if he were suddenly to appear in 2018 Turkey, he too would face opposition.</p> \n<p>You were in the Turkish public-school system after the military coup. What values were promoted there?</p> \n<p>I was born in 1984, four years after the coup. We were brought up to believe that the Turkish army was everything. There was a course in school called “security studies.” It was a compulsory Education Ministry course in every school, including Jewish and Armenian educational institutions. The course was taught by a uniformed teacher. Soldiers would come to deliver the lectures.</p> \n<p>What did they teach you?</p> \n<p>Why we must love military service, why men have to do army service, how women should behave – the way they did during the Turkish War of Independence, by manufacturing ammunition and bringing it to the front, by sacrificing themselves.</p> \n<p>The most important thing we were taught is that the army is a mechanism of checks and balances in a democracy. Until I immigrated to Israel, I thought that was a standard mechanism in democratic countries. It was only here that I saw that the chief of staff was subordinate to the prime minister, to the defense minister. In Turkey we felt that the army was protecting us against the government; that if the government made mistakes, the army would be able to correct them. The Turkish citizen simply did not ask questions when the army intervened in politics. That seemed correct and clear to us.</p> \n<p>If so, how did the Turkish public take Erdogan’s war against the army?</p> \n<p>Erdogan did not declare war on the army out loud. He did something smarter: He weakened the army through the MGK, Turkey’s national security council. It’s actually a type of security cabinet whose chairman is the state president, and its participants are the prime minister, most of the cabinet ministers and also army personnel. The thing is, that, when there was a democratic vote – in quotation marks – in the council, the opinion of the army would get majority acceptance.</p> \n<p>What’s known as a “deep state.”</p> \n<p>All of the army’s decisions would be accepted there automatically and presented as government decisions. So, instead of fighting the army directly, Erdogan simply changed the composition of the council to give the civilians a majority.</p> \n<p>With his ostensible motive being to make Turkey part of the European Union. In fact, at the start of his term, his agenda looked pro-Western.</p> \n<p>To the average citizen, it was if he had been a member of [the ultra-Orthodox Israeli party] Shas, and then he grew disillusioned with the party, and established something like a [secular] Likud of his own – as if he realized that Turkey’s interests lay in the West and not the East.</p> \n<p>With the emphasis on “as if.”</p> \n<p>Yes. Because Erdogan has beat his political rivals anew every time, he doesn’t perceive them as a threat. He is occupied with the media, with the judicial system. The educational system was always in his power anyway. His true rival was always the army.</p> \n<p>‘It’s all legal’</p> \n<p>Let’s talk for a moment about his takeover of the media.</p> \n<p>Erdogan did that together with Islamist businessmen. They simply started to buy the major media channels. It’s all legal. Think, let’s say, of businesspeople associated with Likud buying Haaretz.</p> \n<p>Here people just start up a new paper.</p> \n<p>It’s different. It’s not like launching [the free, pro-Netanyahu daily] Israel Hayom. They already had that. The wanted to change the game – for all intents and purposes, they wanted Haaretz.</p> \n<p>To leave the brand and change the content.</p> \n<p>Yes. And it was all done quietly. Let’s say you’re critical of the government. Suddenly your pieces no longer get published. You’re offered paid leave. Journalists are pushed into a situation where they themselves will say: I’m not staying here. That’s what happened to a lot of mainstream journalists. They left for small newspapers and became the torchbearers of secularism. Bottom line: Erdogan got control of the army, the media and the courts.</p> \n<p>Let’s move to the night of the military coup in 2016. What went through your mind when you watched the images from Turkey?</p> \n<p>When I heard that the Turkish army was blocking the bridge in Istanbul, I thought they must have received information about a terrorist attack, because before the coup, there were many such attacks. I never even thought it was a military coup. In hindsight – and it takes no great wisdom to say this in hindsight – I think Erdogan knew about the coup attempt in advance. He said he heard something from his uncle. Yeah, right. He had information from Turkish intelligence.</p> \n<p>You’re claiming it was staged? We all remember how Erdogan sounded that night. He was hysterical. That was a game?</p> \n<p>No. He really was hysterical, because it wasn’t completely under his control. I don’t think it was staged. But my theory is that he knew about the coup attempt and let it go ahead, because it allowed him to crush the head of the snake, so to speak. Erdogan had all the means to quell the coup, and that’s what we saw. More than 200 people were killed that night. Many are still in prison.</p> \n<p>And after the coup, he had carte blanche to do whatever he wished.</p> \n<p>He declared a state of emergency, which allowed him to sign off on edicts that not even the Constitutional Court can annul.</p> \n<p>But that’s something I didn’t completely understand: Why did Erdogan need it? Even before, no one dared question his authority.</p> \n<p>Before the coup, Erdogan was president of the state. His powers were largely symbolic, like President Reuven Rivlin. In practice, Erdogan gave orders both to the cabinet and to the prime minister. But even so, if the prime minister had dared to counter him – which he never did – it could have been problematic for Erdogan. The state of emergency allowed him to lead the country without being accountable to anyone. Effectively, he took the keys from the prime minister, changed the parliamentary system to a presidential one, and then held another election.</p> \n<p>The referendums, the elections – are they only intended to give the Turks the impression that they’re deciding, or are they aimed outward, at the international community?</p> \n<p>Both. First of all, if he does something drastic, no one can accuse him of doing it on his own. He went to the people. And a majority, even if it’s 51 percent, is what he’s after. Erdogan isn’t looking for a national consensus, he’s looking for a majority. In a democracy, the democratic institutions are obliged to protect the minorities, too. In Turkey, no one cares what the minorities need. Only the majority government. There are no more checks and balances in Turkey, whether they are checks and balances like those of true democracies, such as the courts, or of Turkish democracy, meaning the army.</p> \n<p>There is only Erdogan.</p> \n<p>Right. So as not to be accused of being a dictator, he goes to an election or to a national referendum, and when he wins he can effectively say to the West: “You call me a dictator? People love me. The nation spoke at the voting booth.” There are all kinds of rumors – he did steal votes, he didn’t steal votes. People said that in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018. I don’t understand why the opposition parties are continuing to behave the way they do. Let’s say I’m a soccer player who scores goals only with my hand. Why do you continue to play with me? And if you are playing with me, why do you use only your feet? That’s what the opposition parties are doing. They are legitimizing Erdogan by playing according to the rules.</p> \n<p>But that’s exactly the idea. To play at democracy. There are far more sophisticated mechanisms with which to rule the masses than to behave like a dictatorship. Maybe, as you argued earlier, the democratic conception of the Turkish people is essentially flawed.</p> \n<p>That’s true. We don’t understand it, because we judge Turkey through Western eyes. We don’t understand that in the eyes of the average Turk – not the average American or the average reader of Haaretz – Turkey is a democracy. Accordingly, those who are fighting Erdogan are fighting with him in the same arena. The people who didn’t lose the hope of turning Turkey into a different place are trying to do it through the system. They haven’t yet chosen a different solution.</p> \n<p>Such as what? To take to the streets? You know, they won’t dare go into the streets. If you look at the political map now, is there anyone who is actually standing up to him?</p> \n<p>No. There is no leader capable of posing a threat to Erdogan. That might sound familiar to you.</p> \n<p>What’s known as “he would turn over the keys if only there were someone to give them to.” So what will happen on the day after Erdogan?</p> \n<p>That’s the question of questions. As of now, Erdogan is not giving any other leader a chance. A case in point is the man who was prime minister under him, Ahmet Davutoglu. He was very charismatic, knowledgeable, a polyglot. A genuinely brilliant person. Erdogan didn’t like the fact that people liked him and thought of him as a leader. He decided to make him a puppet, but Davutoglu didn’t accept that. He resigned. His successor, Binali Yildirim, lacked charisma and was a total yes-man of Erdogan’s. [The office of prime minister was abolished earlier this year.] He’s not someone who can lead the people. Today it’s being said in Turkey that when Erdogan dies, his son-in-law, the current finance minister, will succeed him.</p> \n<p>How do you understand the people who vote for Erdogan? What do they think he gives them?</p> \n<p>They see themselves in him.</p> \n<p>They must also see that Turkey is in a problematic economic situation.</p> \n<p>Erdogan has succeeded in persuading the masses that the present economic crisis is due to the American sanctions.</p> \n<p>Do they consider him a good leader?</p> \n<p>Yes. A good and experienced leader, the person who’s closest to the Turkish nation and to the ordinary Turkish citizen, in terms of his connection to the people, in terms of his style of life.</p> \n<p>Are you kidding?</p> \n<p>No.</p> \n<p>What exactly about Erdogan’s lifestyle reminds the ordinary Turkish citizen of his own life? The palace with thousands of rooms? The plane? The servants?</p> \n<p>Turks are not Israelis. Think of the Ottoman Empire – the Turks are used to sultans who live in palaces. Ataturk also lived in a palace in Istanbul. To the average Turk, it’s natural for the ruler to live in a palace, it’s not considered a sign of corruption. On the contrary: It shows that the state is magnificent, that it has power. When Erdogan visits the simple folk, he sits on the floor. He eats with them and drinks with them. He hosts them in the mosque he built in Ankara and prays with them as part of the masses. People are enchanted by the fact that he knows the prayers by heart. Imagine Bibi Netanyahu standing in a synagogue and singing like a cantor. That’s how Erdogan connects with the simple folk. That’s what interests him. Not the elites.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Ramadan Dabash, who teaches civil engineering at Ort Jerusalem College, is a good example of the city’s trend toward integration in recent years. According to a study last year by the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, nearly half of Palestinian workers from East Jerusalem are employed in the west of the city, and nearly 1,500 students from the east are enrolled in Israeli colleges and universities. It’s hard not to notice the many Arab families spending time in the shopping centers and parks of West Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>But to Dabash, things looks a little different. “How does it help me if I’m teaching at a college in West Jerusalem if I go home every day and see the dismal situation of our roads? No sidewalks, no lighting, garbage strewn across the streets, and the pitiful situation of all the other infrastructure?” he says.</p> \n<p>“So you could say that integration exists, but a worker returning to this kind of reality at the end of a day’s work is hit by depression, by the understanding that he’s a lower-ranking person.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Other numbers reflect East Jerusalem’s anemic economy. Some 75 percent of this population group, 320,000 people, live below the poverty line. Overall in Jerusalem the number is 46 percent.</p> \n<p>Thus in this autumn’s local elections, Dabash ran for a spot on the city council, despite his meager chances. Since 1967, most Palestinians in East Jerusalem have boycotted the municipal elections. Dabash received only 3,000 votes; he says this failure stemmed from problems with the voting booths in East Jerusalem. People often had to go to other neighborhoods to vote.</p> \n<p>“Residents of East Jerusalem are caught in an irreconcilable political situation. They don’t want to be residents of the Palestinian Authority, but they want to retain their Palestinian identity – alongside their blue ID cards,” Dabash says, referring to Israeli ID cards. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>“They receive health services through Israeli health maintenance organizations and prefer Hadassah to the hospitals in East Jerusalem. There are workers and businesspeople who travel every day to Tel Aviv and Ramat Gan for work. Slowly but surely they’re being integrated into the Israeli economy.”</p> \n<p>Dabash’s story is but one example of the complex nature of Jerusalem, Israel’s largest city. It’s population tops 901,000 people, and it stretches over 125 square kilometers (48 square miles), from Har Homa and Gilo in the south, bordering Bethlehem, to Neveh Yaakov in the north,&nbsp; abutting Ramallah.</p> \n<p>Within those boundaries, created by the annexation after the Six-Day War, is also an ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, community amounting to 220,000 people. Thus Jerusalem is both Israel’s largest Arab city and largest Haredi city. These two population groups essentially explain why Israel’s capital suffers in the national socioeconomic rankings despite its excellent university and outstanding high schools.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem has for years suffered from negative migration of about 8,000 residents a year, which includes the departure of Haredim stung by high housing prices. Meanwhile, secular Jews often feel they have to fight for their existence in the city.</p> \n<p>Although Jerusalem has enjoyed a cultural upsurge in recent years, including a resurgence of caf&eacute;s, cinemas and entertainment zones active on Shabbat, the city isn’t quite the success story it would like to be, especially compared to Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Haredi/religious-Zionist/secular relations, which have become a main story line in the city for 30 years, have grown even more convoluted in the past decade. In last month’s runoff mayoral election, Ofer Berkovitch presented a proposal for a religious-Zionist/secular consensus in the city, one that wouldn’t be acceptable to the Haredim. Restaurants and cinemas would be open on the Sabbath, but not stores, based on a blueprint from the early 2000s.</p> \n<p>Conversely, the secular community is putting its foot down in Kiryat Hayovel, the neighborhood in southwestern Jerusalem where Haredim have been moving in. The ultra-Orthodox have demanded control of public buildings to open kindergartens and schools, and have tried to prevent the opening of a neighborhood pub on Friday nights.</p> \n<p>At the same time, significant changes are taking place on the Haredi side. Not only are more ultra-Orthodox men getting jobs, an increasing number of families&nbsp; are adopting a more modern Haredi lifestyle. Lee Cahaner, who heads the research division at Oranim Academic College and is a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, says 11 percent of Haredim are so-called modern Haredim.</p> \n<p>“These are productive groups that are looking for a niche that’s incompatible with the classic Haredi lifestyle,” she says. “For example, they want schools where core studies are included in the curriculum,” not just religious studies.</p> \n<p>Still, the fact that they’re modern Haredim doesn’t necessarily end the friction between the groups. “At the end of the day, secular Jews see Haredim as Haredim and don’t distinguish between those who are modern and those who aren’t,” Cahaner says.</p> \n<p>The Chinese of the Middle East</p> \n<p>Avraham Kreuzer, who in the past decade has advised former Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat on Haredi affairs, says the ultra-Orthodox community’s economic potential in Jerusalem is far from being realized. “Through Intel and other plants in the city, we’re already finding a work environment suited to Haredim, but much more can be done. The Haredim are good merchants and are good at negotiating, thanks to their Talmud studies,” he says.</p> \n<p>“There is abundant potential among the Haredim as consumers as well – large families that consume a great deal of clothing and food. This is a still-developing market, and in this respect the Haredim are the Chinese of the Middle East. If in the past they bought clothes in makeshift stores in bomb shelters and in private homes, today they’re buying in shopping centers such as in the Rav Shefa district, a commercial complex of thousands of meters of floor space that yields income to the municipality from arnona property tax.”</p> \n<p>Kreuzer believes that long-term planning and dialogue will bridge the gaps between the secular and the Haredim. “You have to understand that there’s no supreme housing council in the Haredi community that says ‘okay, we’ve&nbsp; conquered Kiryat Hayovel, what’s our next takeover target?’ There’s a reality that develops,” he says.</p> \n<p>“In Kiryat Hayovel, for example, there are a lot of apartment buildings where no one wants to live aside from university students and Haredi families, which also need kindergartens and schools. The main problem is that there’s no advance planning, so I favor the planning of separate neighborhoods for secular people and the Haredim.” &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Historically, the government has done much damage to the city, like expanding&nbsp; the city’s footprint for political reasons, and giving stipends to yeshiva students. But in recent years it has been trying to repair the damage. In 2011, as part of a 10-year plan, the state approved the allocation of more than 1 billion shekels ($268 million) for economic development in the city in tourism and high-tech, as well as for closer ties with the academic world.</p> \n<p>Much money has also been invested in the high-speed rail link to Tel Aviv that, when completed, should reduce travel time between the cities to half an hour. Some Jerusalemites fear that the railway will encourage migration to Tel Aviv, as some people will be able to keep&nbsp; working in the capital but commute. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Also, construction of a new employment district is underway as part of the City Gate project; overall construction will amount to some 1.6 million square meters (17.2 million square feet). About one-quarter of this is designated for office space, and the rest for entertainment facilities and hotels, as well as some housing.</p> \n<p>If this project of 24 buildings succeeds, it’s expected to noticeably boost the city’s receipts from commercial property tax. The new center is going up only a few minutes’ walk from the new railway station, so it’s expected to attract commuters from outside the city.</p> \n<p>“In Jerusalem, they talk a great deal about the population that’s leaving, but you also have to ask where they’re leaving to. There will always be those who won’t feel at home in the city,” says Yair Assaf-Shapira, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research.</p> \n<p>“But does the individual who leaves continue working in Jerusalem, or does he transfer his whole life outside the city? This is a question of tremendous importance. A lot of people are concerned that the migration will increase because of the new railway, but it will also grant more people the possibility to work in the city.”</p> \n<p>Tourism and millennials</p> \n<p>Tourism is expected to remain a prime spoke in Jerusalem’s economy. According to the Jerusalem Development Authority, between 75 percent and 80 percent of tourists visiting Israel come to Jerusalem. Thus if in the first 10 months of the year some 3.4 million tourists arrived in Israel, between 2.5 million and 2.7 million passed through the city. Why don’t all tourists arriving in Israel, or at least 95 percent of them, visit Jerusalem – a city with unique attractions on an international scale?</p> \n<p>“Jerusalem is like a million-dollar check but no one has covered it,” says Michael Weiss, chairman of the Jerusalem Tourism Forum. “There remains a lot more room for development of tourism in the city. We have to double the tourism budget on digital, and to make a focused approach to millennials, as well as to tourists from China.”</p> \n<p>As a tourism destination, Jerusalem depends on the security situation, Weiss adds, mentioning the so-called stabbing intifada of 2015 and 2016. “Some hotels shut down entire floors to save on electricity and cut back their workforce,” he says. “Restaurants and printing shops shut down and there was a slowdown in the transportation sector. At one point there was a campaign calling on Jerusalemites to go out to eat at restaurants in the city.”</p> \n<p>Ayal Zaum, an expert on branding cities, believes that attracting foreign tourists might change the city for the better in the long run. He mentions a project he took part in to brand Jerusalem as a place of culture, as opposed to Jerusalem as a place of history and religion. “That’s what interests the public nowadays,” he says.</p> \n<p>“In Egypt, tourists will go to see the pyramids, but they’ll also seek out local cuisine, local culture, markets. Realizing this, the Jerusalem municipality has invested a great deal in culture – in festivals and culinary events, in various outdoor events.”</p> \n<p>The proper development of culture in a city can also stoke economic changes. In the next few years, the Bezalel School of Art and Design is expected to move to the Russian Compound. Bezalel’s move to Mount Scopus after the Six-Day War is still considered one of downtown Jerusalem’s worst planning mistakes. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to former Knesset member Erel Margalit, a Jerusalem resident and head of Jerusalem Venture Partners, the move could set off a revolution. “Think of 2,400 students moving into the heart of the city,” he says. “It’s filled with action – the entire subject of digital media, photography, visual art, advertising. Businesses related to these fields could flourish with a return by Bezalel.”</p> \n<p>Margalit links the potential of new art businesses to what could happen with the city’s high-tech. As of 2016, according to the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, only 5.5 percent of people employed in the city worked in high-tech. Only 6 percent of high-tech companies in Israel were located in Jerusalem – compared with 29 percent in Tel Aviv. In Jerusalem 42 percent of workers were employed in the public sector, thus there’s lots of upside potential for high-tech in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Every high-tech company in the city that employs a Jerusalemite receives a grant between 80,000 and 100,000 shekels per employee; these grants have been allotted for six years. Alas,&nbsp; 60 percent of high-tech workers live outside the city.</p> \n<p>“We see that the number of high-tech companies in Jerusalem has greatly increased – an increase of 40 percent – and there has also been an increase in the number of people employed in the sector,” says Yamit Naftali, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies. “But actually, when you look at the city’s economy, there have been no significant changes – not in the average wage and not in the poverty rate.”</p> \n<p>High-tech is growing, but it’s not trickling down. “I’m tired of hearing about high-tech,” she says.&nbsp; “Jerusalem’s potential isn’t in high-tech; we’re seeing that the grants aren’t helping. We have to integrate Haredim and Arabs into the city’s economy.”</p> \n<p>Naftali and her Jerusalem Institute colleague Yuval Shiftan released a study in February predicting what would happen if the workforce participation rate of women from East Jerusalem resembled that of women in the Israeli Arab community. For that to happen, the number would have to increase to 35 percent from 22 percent in 2016.</p> \n<p>Naftali and Shiftan found that if these women earned around 5,000 shekels a month, the financial contribution to the city would reach 457 million shekels. But the two researchers say that due to low wages, not all families in which women worked would break out of the cycle of poverty.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It was in the Shleikes Jewish food restaurant in Bnei Brak that I got the definitive proof of how gossip has conquered the ultra-Orthodox public. I had arrived for a joint interview with journalist Itzik Ohana, whose specialty is coverage of get-togethers between secular celebs and rabbis, along with Haredi political analyst Yisrael Cohen, who admits that he’s turned to yellow journalism in recent years. By chance, the new publisher of the Haredi website Behadrei Haredim, Miki Barzel, came in. Cohen, who has a healthy sense of humor, asked Ohana to take his picture with Barzel and post it on Twitter, with a caption wondering whether he was defecting to Behadrei Haredim. The photo quickly spread from the tweet to a galaxy of WhatsApp groups.</p> \n<p>It then turned out that others had also clandestinely photographed the chance meeting two weeks ago. A hullabaloo ensued. Within minutes, Cohen’s phone began to vibrate with messages from a bevy of ultra-Orthodox media-industry reporters who wanted to know whether he was actually leaving Kol Harama, the radio station he’s identified with. Cohen’s denial only heightened the suspicions.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, a report about the fact that I had met with the two jokesters at Shleikes (which means “suspenders” in Yiddish) found its way into the Haredi gossip columns, accompanied by a historic photo: Cohen, Ohana and me seated with a plate of gefilte fish garnished with carrot, on the table between us. Even before the gefilte fish had been digested, we all gained everlasting fame. A week later, photographer Tomer Appelbaum, who took the picture of the duo, was the subject of an item on the Haredi news site actualic.co.il.</p> \n<p>After years in which the Haredi press was generally quite limited, both in terms of content and dissemination, the advent of the internet stood that world on its head. Five years ago, the first official gossip column, Leibele, was inaugurated on Behadrei Haredim. It’s since been joined by Bekleine, on the Actualic site, Tzitzit on the Kikar Hashabbat news site and also by Pashkevil, a website geared to the Haredi advertising industry. A dedicated gossip site called Pichifkes initially took off but shut down a year ago. And there are also ultra-Orthodox groups on WhatsApp and Twitter, which are abuzz with gossip and often beat the conventional columns to the punch.</p> \n<p>The explosion in the Haredi media world today recalls the glory days of the Israeli media in the 1990s, when an item about the move of a reporter living in a leaky apartment from a local paper to the big leagues would be a story worthy of coverage. These days, the view in newspapers is that the public isn’t really interested in media personnel. However, in the Haredi galaxy, the outmoded notion of the branzha (slang for “guild”) is enjoying an unprecedented boom. For example, if a novice Haredi journalist is caught stuffing himself with cholent, or even just strolling – merciful heavens! – on Rabbi Akiva Street in Bnei Brak, that’s a huge scoop.</p> \n<p>Menachem Koldetsky, 35, is the person behind the Bekleine gossip column. A decade ago, Koldetsky was a kashrut supervisor during a shmita year (the sabbatical year, when the land is to be left fallow), and when it ended dug around for a new job. He found himself working for the weekly in his ultra-Orthodox hometown of Modi’in Illit. At first he wrote under the pen name Menachem Hadar. Journalism wasn’t a profession to be proud of back then in Haredi circles.</p> \n<p>“There were hardly any Haredi reporters at the time,” he recalls. “I had a non-internet computer, I wrote an article and sent it via a friend, something about selling willow branches for the Sukkot holiday. I didn’t dare ask whether the article would be published. Then, when the paper appeared, I suddenly see the item. I started to work for Kikar Hashabbat ” – the online ultra-Orthodox paper – “and had one scoop after another. I’m the person who invented the term ‘Hapeleg Hayerushalmi’” (the “Jerusalem Faction,” referring to the militant followers of the late Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach).</p> \n<p>But today Koldetsky writes the gossip column. “These days, gossip draws more responses than an article about [MK Moshe] Gafni, [Deputy Health Minister Yaakov] Litzman” – the leaders of the United Torah Judaism faction in the Knesset – “or the conscription law,” he explains. “People want something voyeuristic, something bizarre. It used to be that the beadle of Rabbi Schach or Rabbi Elyashiv was someone you saw only in places of learning; people didn’t go to malls and didn’t have cellphones. Today that has all changed. Look at Moshe Abutbul, the former mayor of Beit Shemesh – he’s constantly uploading items using the ‘stories’ feature on the Actualic site.”</p> \n<p>Do the admors, rabbinical leaders of Haredi communities, like to be written about?</p> \n<p>Koldetsky: “In contrast to Leibele, I write less about rabbis, more about journalists. It’s an industry column. But I will write about a yeshiva head who abuses children. I had information about that and I published a hint about it in Bekleine.”</p> \n<p>In the gossip column? But that’s a news item.</p> \n<p>“I wrote that a new scandal was about to explode having to do with a yeshiva in a Haredi city. He got on a plane and fled. Half a year later, he realized that the issue had been dropped and he came back. In cases like that, we write about ‘grave acts.’ The Haredim by now understand what ‘grave acts’ means – there are codes.”</p> \n<p>Why, for example, does my meeting with journalist Yisrael Cohen merit a mention in your gossip column?</p> \n<p>“The fact is that it’s the most widely read thing among the Haredi public. I also like to write about anonymous people. For example, about a photographer no one ever heard of. After he got into the gossip columns he became the photographer for [the ultra-Orthodox political party] Degel Hatorah. People also like to read an item about how the mayor’s driver went to eat kugel. Humor is a very important element in the column.</p> \n<p>“There are also stories that I don’t write about. Despite the traffic, there are red lines. We won’t write about pregnancy – it’s too voyeuristic. Leibele doesn’t mention women. We do, but not too much. [Zionist Union MK] Tzipi Livni, yes; modest Haredi women, yes. But I’m afraid of creating an obstacle [for readers]. We are breakthrough people, but the readers want a column with limits, they aren’t able to look at daring photos.”</p> \n<p>Do you go to events or mostly get tips by phone?</p> \n<p>“I don’t have to make the rounds, people tell me things.”</p> \n<p>Sounds like everyone’s a spy.</p> \n<p>“I have plenty of sources. I hear the real gossip that we can’t publish. It’s not easy to vote for Degel Hatorah after hearing about all their quarrels and intrigues. But we don’t want to hurt people.”</p> \n<p>'Juicy items'</p> \n<p>Doesn’t being a journalist mean speaking the truth?</p> \n<p>“Not if you do injury to a certain rabbi.”</p> \n<p>Are you and Leibele in competition?</p> \n<p>“The truth is that he lives two buildings away from me. We’re both busy, he focuses on admors, I’m more into the PR people and the juicy items.”</p> \n<p>Who’s more sensationalist, you or him?</p> \n<p>“I am, regrettably. He has limits.”</p> \n<p>A few years ago, when Koldetsky was away in Tiberias, people phoned him to say that the neighborhoods were full of pashkvelim (wall posters) denouncing him. “I came out against mayors and they didn’t like it,” he says. “They all just lick, I bite. That was one of the causes of the rabbis’ boycott of the internet. I started to expose corruption and to publicize failures. I showed time after time how a certain city was neglected, and the public was shocked.”</p> \n<p>Were you offended by the posters?</p> \n<p>“People told me they didn’t know I was so famous. I took it with a smile, I have a tough hide, although I thought it would be hard for my wife. But she was strong. I got a message from a certain public figure of whom I was regularly critical, saying he wanted to meet me at a caf&eacute;. We sat with a mediator. And then the mediator said, ‘Listen, you stop writing about the public figure, otherwise you’ll find yourself out of the city.’ I toned down the criticism.</p> \n<p>“There’s no real democracy, we are limited. Before that I had felt intoxicated by power. I fired in every direction, and that led to sidewalks being fixed. I was also criticized for writing about the struggle against anti-Mizrahi discrimination. People asked me, ‘Why are you defending the Frenks?’” – a derogatory term for Jews of Sephardic origin.</p> \n<p>You could have been a topflight investigative reporter – why stir up people’s kugel?</p> \n<p>“I’m a jack of all trades. I do political expos&eacute;s, and the gossip comes along with it. The public likes that. And if I’ve said something good about someone, he says ‘Thank you, you’ve made my Saturday evening.’ On the other hand, if a public figure married off his daughter and I didn’t run a photo in my column, it’s as though the wedding didn't happen. If you’re not in the column, you don’t exist.”</p> \n<p>You and the others have become something very different from the secular stigma associated with ultra-Orthodox people.</p> \n<p>“The public is becoming more open. During the Gulf War in 1991, we played jacks, everything was pure and innocent. Today we live in a more permissive world. There’s been a dramatic change in recent years. On the other hand, there were those who warned that if we surfed the web we would slide into the abyss. Thanks to the accommodating leadership of [the late Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib] Shteinman, none of those dark scenarios came to pass. People opened up, but stayed within the territory. Once you would go to the kiosk to watch a soccer game; today you get the game over the phone. You can surf the internet, go to the beach, travel abroad, go to caf&eacute;s. People don’t peek into each other’s homes, like they used to. There’s greater space.”</p> \n<p>The first Haredi gossip column was Leibele, which was launched five years ago. It was founded by the former editor of Behadrei Haredim, David Rotenberg, and then took a break. The column was revived by a journalist who goes by the pseudonym “Moshe Weissberg.” Today, he is 32 and the father of four.</p> \n<p>“It’s extremely popular,” Weissberg relates. “Internet sites look for the sensational everywhere. Listen, Haredim have always loved neies. The word means ‘news’ in Yiddish, but really, it refers to gossip. Haredim are very interested, for example, in which store opened and which closed. People on Shabbat eve at home – what do they talk about? This one closed, that one opened. It really interests people.”</p> \n<p>In the secular population, the concept of the branzha (meaning both members of the media community and gossip about them) doesn’t interest the broad public, it’s even considered elitist.</p> \n<p>“Our readers wait every week for it. It’s no joke.”</p> \n<p>And women?</p> \n<p>“We censor photographs of women. If there’s a scoop and there’s a woman in the photo who can’t be cropped out, we blur it. In [items about] marriage proposals, the woman’s image is blurred or not put in at all.”</p> \n<p>How do you live with that?</p> \n<p>“It’s what the public doesn’t want to see. There are children.”</p> \n<p>I can’t believe you’d pass up a huge scoop like a photo of Tzipi Livni gnawing at a challah in Bnei Brak.</p> \n<p>“[Justice Minister] Ayelet Shaked met with Rabbi Poborsky – that was a main headline. But without her picture. We sent a photographer to get an exclusive shot, but only tweeted it.”</p> \n<p>Why do you use an alias?</p> \n<p>“Other journalists know who I am, but from the Haredi perspective I don’t want to be too famous. I’ve been asked to give interviews by numberless television programs as a [Hasidic] court journalist – after all, my ‘doctorate’ is in admors – but I prefer not to.”</p> \n<p>Are the admors happy when you publish photos of them, for example, dacing with a rope [at a wedding]?</p> \n<p>“They’re not into it.”</p> \n<p>But they know about it?</p> \n<p>“I believe they’re exposed to it.”</p> \n<p>Does it seem reasonable to you that rabbinical sages should become celebs?</p> \n<p>“They’re our personages. That’s the price. A few years ago, I published a photograph of an admor filling out a lottery form in Petah Tikva. If the rabbi bought a form, it’s a sign that it’s not a disgrace. He too has to make a living. I see it greatness in this.”</p> \n<p>I meet with the pseudonymous Weissberg at the editorial offices of Behadrei Haredim, on the second floor of a gas station in Bnei Brak. “The world’s biggest Haredi portal,” a sign on the wall says. Kikar Hashabbat, for its part, terms itself “the world’s leading Haredi website.”</p> \n<p>Even though Weissberg is one of those responsible for the sensationalist thrust, he feels that a red line has been crossed.</p> \n<p>“I was having my hair cut on the eve of the holiday, and the door was open. I then received simultaneously five photos of myself there, taken by five different people, and I hadn’t even noticed them. People send me pictures of themselves and ask me to upload them, as if they’d been spotted by me. I will try to avoid doing that. I tell them, ‘Listen, that’s more demeaning than it is respectable. People will know you asked, there’s no point.’ But sometimes it’s uncomfortable for me, so I run the photo. There are ‘WhatsApp boys’ in the Haredi community, who will be members of 150 different groups and get a salary from people to spread news about them in the groups.”</p> \n<p>You and Koldetsky both live in Modi’in Ilit, which is the poorest town in Israel. Maybe there are more important things you could do with your talent.</p> \n<p>“Modi’in Ilit is a model city. You don’t see poverty there. It should be a model for every city in Israel.”</p> \n<p>Looking for blood</p> \n<p>No article about the Haredi world of gossip would be complete without mention of the rise and decline of the father of Haredi paparazzi, Boaz Ben-Ari. Known by the nickname “Quick Temper,” Ben-Ari is 38 and from Jerusalem. I first met him at the Knesset. I saw a person with extravagant dress – a spectacular red scarf, red buttons and red glasses. I wasn’t even sure he was ultra-Orthodox. Using a telephoto lens, he photographed the texts of MKs’ private WhatsApp conversations and published them. But the revolutionaries are the first victims of the revolution. In the past few years, Quick Temper has slowed down. He couldn’t compete with the yeshiva students who uploaded photos to WhatsApp before he could.</p> \n<p>“Today everyone has a smartphone and can upload material in a jiffy,” he says. “And the editors want the ultra-sensational. The thrill quotient is rising, and they want blood, traffic accidents with Haredim. Or, you blur the picture a little and upload terror attacks with a lot of blood and red. I have rules. I don’t show blood. It corrupts the photographer’s soul. At a certain point, I just said no.”</p> \n<p>“Madhouse” is how he describes the way he runs around from one candle-lighting ceremony to another during the week of Hanukkah. We are speaking after he photographed a candle-lighting at the Belz Yeshiva. I ask him if he had been invited, and he tells me that the Hasidic communities officially invite only Shuki Lerer, the country’s official admor photographer, who focuses on the rabbi himself in each case. “I want to photograph the different, the Hasid who’s waiting for the admor, but has fallen asleep from weariness. It’s yellow journalism, but not low-yellow.”</p> \n<p>Ben-Ari started to upload photos to the Behadrei Haredim forum on the Hyde Park site, even before Behadrei Haredim had its own site. “That’s when the first Nokia phones with cameras came out, and people didn’t even know the phones had a camera. I took pictures and uploaded them. Things started to get out of hand, because no one knew who was daring to take pictures from inside.</p> \n<p>“One time I went to the wedding of the daughter of a public figure and I uploaded it while the wedding ceremony was still underway. There was a huge uproar. It was the first time this had happened. Generally the pictures are published a week later and are filtered. People understood that someone was changing the rules of the game. Dozens of times I was thrown out the window, and not as a joke, and then I would come back through the same window. The Gur Rebbe won’t allow his picture to be taken. His Hasids fight to make sure that he’s not photographed. But I hid and took really good pictures.”</p> \n<p>Even so, Ben-Ari has a hard time with the growing sensationalism of the Haredi media. “It’s very painful,” he says. “Why do we need to show these sides of ourselves? It sells, yes, it’s sexy, that’s absolutely true. But is this what they want to show the outside world about the community? Because of that, my material is less highly regarded now. I don’t shoot the dirt.”</p> \n<p>Spotted at the Kotel</p> \n<p>There are people who become absolutely addicted to gossip. Until recently, journalist and social media personality Itzik Ohana, 21, went by the pen name Itzik Mann. What really enthralls him is when secular celebs, like the singer Omer Adam and the model Bar Refaeli, meet with rabbis. Ohana describes himself as a “pillar of gossip” on the web. Even though he hasn’t been salaried since leaving Behadrei Haredim recently, he posts gossip on his Twitter account with the expectation that it will be published on websites afterward. He earns a living from what he collects from the “neies lines” – headlines related to the ultra-Orthodox community that are sent to people’s phones. “Gafni said this, [MK Meir] Porush said that. When [singer] Kobi Peretz is spotted at the graves of tzadikim [holy men], it draws more traffic than anything. [Singer] Eyal Golan is seen at the Kotel [the Western Wall] – that’s gets more clicks than politics. Sometimes people reread the same item a few times. I can’t always figure out how people who don’t have a smartphone even know what I’ve written. Maybe they go to an internet caf&eacute;.”</p> \n<p>Do rabbis send you items?</p> \n<p>“Their people cooperate in the fullest manner. For example, Rabbi Yigal Cohen, who is getting close with Omer Adam. Last year, everything changed [with Adam]. A secular celeb may not observe Shabbat, but he feels an affinity for Judaism and is happy for there to be a photograph of him wearing a kippa.” Ohana tells me about an editor on a television program who regularly draws on his assistance about Haredi issues. “Journalists were looking for [the so-called singing rabbi] Dudu Dery, and I arranged it within three minutes,” he says. “The gossip columns know who to contact.”</p> \n<p>You’re addicted, Itzik.</p> \n<p>“Everyone has his hobby.”</p> \n<p>The political analyst Israel Cohen (who also writes op-eds for Haaretz) is not a gossip columnist, but he’s mentioned in almost everyone else’s column. He explains how to write about models without upsetting the rabbinical overseers, for example: “When Bar Refaeli arrived for a Torah lesson in Bnei Brak a year ago, we mentioned her in Kikar Hashabbat under the rubric of a businesswoman.”</p> \n<p>A businesswoman?</p> \n<p>“She really is a businesswoman. Gossip is part of our foundation. There were always the famous gossip-mongers in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem. Why his wife didn’t bear children, why that one died young. Because people are occupied with serious things, with Torah and halakha [religious law], they need the escape, and these columns provide that.”</p> \n<p>What has the gossip done to political coverage?</p> \n<p>“If in the past we published a speech by MK Menachem Eliezer Mozes [United Torah Judaism] and that impressed people, today people want to hear about all kinds of secret meetings and backroom deals. Gossip isn’t a secular thing, it’s a Haredi invention. We simply have an inclination toward it.”</p> \n<p>Why, I ask, is such a large part of the coverage devoted to journalists? Cohen explains: “There are no models or actors among the Haredi public. The media person is a star.”</p> \n<p>Effie Feldman, chairman of Ihud Hatzala, the Haredi-run emergency medical services organization, approaches our table in Shleikes excitedly. “He’s a gossipy type,” Cohen tells me, and for some reason Feldman does not take offense at this. Asked how he feels about the coverage he gets in the gossip columns, Feldman admits that “as a person, I enjoy the photos of him.”</p> \n<p>No backgammon</p> \n<p>One individual who has benefited from the flourishing of gossip columns in the Haredi community is Rabbi Haim Horovitz, whom Ohana dubs “one of the heads of the council of celebs’ rabbis.” The official rabbi of the affluent Tzahala neighborhood in Tel Aviv, Horovitz rattles off the names of his students from the realms of entertainment and fashion: Zvika Hadar, Bar Refaeli, Shlomit Malka, Yehuda Levy and Omer Adam.</p> \n<p>“A purely spiritual-Torah relationship has been created between us,” he explains. “We don’t play backgammon in caf&eacute;s and we don’t crack jokes. There’s a mutual feeling of admiration and esteem between us.”</p> \n<p>What do you think about the Haredi gossip on the internet?</p> \n<p>Horovitz: “It’s clear that people like it. It’s interesting, nice; people are by nature attracted to celebrities. When a report is published on a religious social network about my meetings with celebs, 95 percent like it and 5 percent find it inappropriate.”</p> \n<p>What’s your response to the 5 percent?</p> \n<p>“I don’t have Instagram. People write about me. I don’t write, I only embrace. A rabbi’s role is to make Torah loved by all classes. It’s easy to do that with a yeshiva student, but I try to reach people who don’t come from a place of Torah, including models and television personalities. I try to be like Aaron in the Bible. I show that the Torah is cool, relevant and interesting. It’s impossible to ignore the meteor of technology. In the end the meteor arrives and it affects everyone.”</p> \n<p>Even though the rabbi sends out heart emojis on WhatsApp and resorts frequently to secular jargon, it’s important for Horovitz to make it clear that he is first and foremost an ultra-Orthodox Jew. “I am not only a Haredi,” he says, “I am 10th generation of highly regarded rabbis. Shlomo Auerbach is my uncle. I am hard-core Haredi, the head of a kollel [yeshiva for married men] and a neighborhood rabbi. But you need the language, the access. If we close ourselves off, we have done nothing. Judaism belongs to the Jews, not to the religiously observant.”</p> \n<p>Don’t people look askance at meetings with non-religious celebs?</p> \n<p>“As [former Prime Minister] Yitzhak Shamir said, ‘It’s lucky we have a back, because you can talk behind a person’s back.’ I am a regular visitor to Rabbi [Chaim] Kanievsky’s house, I meet with MKs. Everyone says I am doing holy work.”</p> \n<p>The growing sensationalism of the Haredi media is a phenomenon of recent years and continues to intensify. Where and how it will stop is not clear. This new world is creating an ethically slippery situation, with porous boundaries between journalists and PR people. Journalists don’t earn much, and it’s quite possible that some are tempted into extracurricular activities. As Itzik Ohana gives me a lift, he asserts that “there are journalists who get money from politicians. That happened, for example, in advance of the recent municipal elections. I know of some who took money and then wrote about a certain candidate that he would be the next mayor. I also received offers, but refused them. I’m very careful about things like that.”</p> \n<p>Adds Koldetsky: “It’s a well-known thing. I also got hints. I was offered scoops and it was hinted that there were more things they could give me. I believe that every sensible person knows that there’s a snake in the grass.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A proposal by MK Bezalel Smotrich (Habayit Hayehudi) to significantly expand the application of a law letting small communities screen potential residents is due at the Ministerial Committee for Legislation on Sunday. The law currently applies to communities with up to 400 families; the new bill would increase this number to 700.</p> \n<p>This law, the Acceptance to Communities Law, has been a stain on Israel’s lawbooks since it was passed in 2011. It lets communities in the Negev and the Galilee with up to 400 families screen those seeking to buy a house there and reject applicants based on “unsuitability to the sociocultural fabric of the community.”</p> \n<p>This law not only legitimizes racism, exclusion, isolationism and elitism, it encourages and stokes it. The law’s criteria are vague and actually make it possible for the members of a community to exclude people they consider undesirable.</p> \n<p>Communities that have screening committees let their residents choose their neighbors through an insulting invasion of candidates’ privacy and reject them based on their affiliation with a minority, even though the law formally “prohibits discrimination.” This is the unconcealed intent of the law’s framers: “Arab-free” communities.</p> \n<p>Expanding the law will dramatically increase the harm. Even the original ceiling of 400 families was far from the law’s “communal” logic, which was designed to maintain “sociocultural cohesion” in small rural communities.</p> \n<p>The intent to raise the ceiling to 700 families brings the truth to light: This isn’t a law to protect the right of small, cohesive communities to exist, it’s a law to allow strong and well-off communities to screen out Arabs, Mizrahim, the ultra-Orthodox, the secular, single parents, LGBT people, people with disabilities and any other unwanted groups. The opponents of the original law warned that it enshrined discrimination. Now the discrimination is being ramped up a notch.</p> \n<p>In the debate on the nation-state bill, a clause was removed that was intended – openly and without whitewashing as in the Acceptance to Communities Law – to permit separation of communities by ethnicity. It seems an attempt is now being made to achieve the same result in another way. The government must not allow this.</p> \n<p>It should come as no surprise that with the passing of the Acceptance to Communities Law and the nation-state law, attempts are cropping up to maintain “the Jewishness of the city” – as we have seen in Afula, for example. This is a dangerous development that must be uprooted immediately. The exclusionist, isolationist and racist Acceptance to Communities Law must be abolished, not strengthened and expanded.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nationalist parties and governments across Europe are investing a lot of effort to cultivate their narrative, or to put it more simply, to rewrite history. In particular, they understate their countrymen’s role in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>This is the backdrop for Hungary’s Holocaust museum scheduled to open next year, another link in the chain of attempts to whitewash Hungary’s collaboration with the Nazis. Now it turns out, as Channel 10 News has reported, that representatives of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are negotiating with Hungary “to create a consensus regarding the museum’s narrative.”</p> \n<p>Narrative? Consensus? Why should Israel have anything to do with this whitewashing? There’s no “narrative.” There’s nonnegotiable historical truth.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Budapest Holocaust museum: Orban's grand gesture or whitewashing of Hungarian history?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These are the facts. Hungarian anti-Semites had a lot of support dating back years before the war. With Miklos Horthy’s rise to power in 1920, limits were placed on the number of Jews in higher education. Later Horthy forged an alliance with Hitler and openly sympathized with the Nazi regime.</p> \n<p>In 1938 Hungary’s First Jewish Law was passed, setting quotas for Jews in various fields; a year later the Second Jewish Law defined a Jew by the origin of one parent, a decisive step on the road to disaster.</p> \n<p>In joining the offensive against the Soviet Union in 1941, Hungary handed over around 18,000 Jewish refugees to the Nazis. These Jews were murdered at Kamianets-Podilskyi in today’s western Ukraine. Then the Third Jewish Law banned marriages between Jews and Christians.</p> \n<p>The equality Jews had won at the end of the 19th century had been abolished and they were listed as a lesser race. Jewish farmland was confiscated on the grounds that the Jews were considered a foreign race with no ties to Hungary. Horthy forced around 100,000 Jewish men into labor battalions, 40,000 of whom died. He did, however, refuse to hand over all the Jews to Germany.</p> \n<p>But with the Nazi conquest of Hungary in March 1944, Adolf Eichmann arrived as head off an SS team known as the Eichmann commandos, which numbered about 150 to 200 people. Within two months they concentrated half a million Jews from rural areas into ghettos.</p> \n<p>The process of their annihilation began on May 15. Over an amazingly short period of 56 days, 424,000 Jews were shipped by train to the gas chambers at Birkenau, in what amounted to the most intensive deportation of the Holocaust. Eichmann’s small team couldn’t have done it without the help of the authorities and the wider population. The Hungarians did in fact collaborate.</p> \n<p>Amid the mass murder, President Franklin Roosevelt threatened Horthy that the United States would act if the transports didn’t stop. A few days later, 600 American bombers attacked Budapest. Horthy halted the transports on July 6, ahead of the planned date for the deportation of the capital’s Jews.</p> \n<p>This was proof that when the Hungarian government wanted, it could stop the deportations. But for most of Hungary’s Jews it was too late. Outside the capital there were no Jews left. These lands were judenrein.</p> \n<p>More than 150,000 Jews were left in Budapest; Horthy held them as a bargaining chip with the Allies. In October he was overthrown by the Nazis and replaced by the anti-Semitic Ferenc Szalasi, head of the fascist Arrow Cross party. Eichmann, who couldn’t get ahold of trains, sent tens of thousands of Jews on death marches toward Austria. Thousands were killed by Arrow Cross gangs. The Russians liberated the ghetto in January 1945.</p> \n<p>In less than a year, 564,500 of Hungary’s Jews had been massacred. Most of the slaughter was committed by the Germans, but the Nazis wouldn’t have been able to commit all these murders without the massive cooperation of the Hungarians.</p> \n<p>This is a terrible truth, but it’s the truth all the same. Will Israel be the one to lend a hand to this distortion of the facts? No diplomatic or economic rationale could justify doing so. It would be an unforgivable act for Netanyahu to cooperate with such a whitewash.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prof. Yehuda Bauer, the world-renowned Israeli Holocaust researcher, is upset again. Just months after lambasting the Israeli government for “surrendering” to Poland’s narrative of the Holocaust, he’s targeting another East European country’s addressing of its past. It’s Hungary, where a heated debate is underway over the new Holocaust museum, the House of Fates.</p> \n<p>“We’re demanding recognition from the Hungarians about the fact that the entire country, not just ‘some Hungarians,’ cooperated with the Germans,” Bauer told Haaretz on Thursday, speaking as honorary chairman of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu and Orban: An illiberal bromance spanning from D.C. to Jerusalem | Analysis</p> \n<p>The impressive structure in Budapest’s Eighth District, an area that went from crime-ridden neighborhood to entertainment hub – is hard to miss. The huge Star of David at the front of the building stands out as if it were suspended in the air. The light shining from it is meant to illuminate the entire night, at least according to the designer. The Hungarian government didn’t scrimp on this initiative – the building cost $18 million.</p> \n<p>The building was dedicated in 2015 but it’s still empty, awaiting artifacts that the government is due to provide. The museum’s opening has now been indefinitely delayed over the failure to agree on how it will present the most sensitive part of the story – Hungary’s involvement in the Nazis’ crimes.</p> \n<p>The battle quickly turned from a debate between historians into a fight between politicians. It managed to split the local Jewish community too – and then seeped abroad.</p> \n<p>Not one tourist has visited the building, which was supposed to join a long list of other Holocaust museums in other capitals around the world. In Hungary, as elsewhere, the museum has become a symbol of the battle over the remembrance of the past.</p> \n<p>On Rosh Hashanah this year, the Hungarian Jewish community, which opposes the opening of the museum, was taken by surprise when Viktor Orban’s government transferred management of the museum to a young local rabbi, Shlomo Koves. The rabbi is affiliated with Chabad, the international Hasidic outreach movement. The intention is that the museum will open in 2019, marking the 75th anniversary of the Holocaust in Hungary.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Will Israel abet Hungary's whitewash museum? | Opinion</p> \n<p>Koves, who was born in Budapest in 1979, is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor and has a doctorate in Jewish-Hungarian history. He told Haaretz that under no circumstances would he help in “distorting history,” adding that he sought to improve the thinking of a generation of Hungarians on Holocaust remembrance, as well as their attitude toward Jews and Israel.</p> \n<p>He’s now busy with the museum’s exhibits, helping historians and experts, both local and international, he says. He talks about the understandings with the Hungarian government; the museum “needs to fully reflect the historical facts and preserve the memory of the Holocaust.” He says the museum’s exhibits will be free of political influence and express “the true story of the Holocaust in Hungary.”</p> \n<p>Members of the Jewish community have said Chabad doesn’t have the experience to run such a museum and that Koves’ appointment was designed to provide a fig leaf for the glorification of Orban.</p> \n<p>Andras Heisler, the president of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities, who was in Israel on Thursday, said Chabad came to Hungary only 15 to 20 years ago, has no roots in the country and has focused on religion, not the Holocaust. He says his own organization has the expertise, archives and international contacts to address the subject, so Chabad isn’t needed.</p> \n<p>The concerns expressed by Heisler, who was born in Budapest in 1955 to a family that has been in the country for centuries, are shared by Bauer. “To obtain a Jewish stamp of approval, the Hungarian government has recruited a rabbi no one had heard of and who hasn’t been dealing with these subjects at all,” Bauer said.</p> \n<p>The view from Yad Vashem</p> \n<p>Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center and other highly regarded international organizations oppose the project. In 2014, Yad Vashem officials resigned from the international forum that the Hungarian government convened to consult on the project. Yad Vashem mentioned “fundamental criticism regarding its concept and content.”</p> \n<p>Critics of the House of Fates also object to the involvement of the Public Foundation for the Research of Central and East European History and Society, which is headed by Maria Schmidt, derided by her opponents as Orban’s “court historian.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Hungary's Jews rail over anti-Semitic magazine over targeting their community head</p> \n<p>“Schmidt claims that the moment the Germans entered Hungary, the Hungarians had no way to oppose them,” said Bauer, who called the claim baseless because, he said, it was the Hungarian government and not the Germans that halted the deportation of the country’s Jews when it wished to. “It did it on July 7, 1944. If it had wished, it could have done it on March 19,” the date that year when Germany occupied Hungary. The deportations were largely to Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>Schmidt manages, for example, the House of Terror, which draws parallels between the Nazis’ crimes and those committed by the communists. It’s a familiar narrative in post-communist Eastern Europe and has drawn criticism from some Holocaust researchers.</p> \n<p>Schmidt also owns the pro-government economics magazine Figyelo. Earlier this month the magazine’s front cover showed Heisler surrounded by floating banknotes; the article alleged that Heisler has been involved in financial irregularities.</p> \n<p>The cover was widely criticized as anti-Semitic. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent his diplomatic adviser, Reuven Azar, to ask the Hungarian government to denounce the anti-Semitism in “domestic controversies in Hungary.”</p> \n<p>Speaking to Haaretz on Thursday, Heisler called the cover anti-Semitic and frightening, adding that he had hitherto only seen such depictions in books on the 1930s. He also completely denied the allegations against him in the article.</p> \n<p>Heisler said that even though the magazine had close ties to Orban, he hoped the negative reaction the article prompted around the world would prevent this type of material from being published again. But later Thursday Orban refused to condemn the magazine.</p> \n<p>Another Hungarian-born Jewish notable who has faced a campaign tainted by anti-Semitism is George Soros, the billionaire Holocaust survivor who has become Orban’s nemesis because of Soros’ support for left-wing groups and his criticism of the government’s harsh immigration policy.</p> \n<p>As Heisler put it, Netanyahu “doesn’t like him either. We, as a community, don’t judge whether he’s a good person or bad, but we cannot accept words of hatred against any person – gays, immigrants, Roma, Muslims or Soros.”</p> \n<p>Thus Heisler wrote an open letter to Orban condemning the government campaign against Soros, which peaked last year with posters using anti-Semitic motifs.</p> \n<p>The Hungarian government is trying to calm the fears that the museum will distort history.</p> \n<p>&quot;We would like to commemorate the national tragedy of the Holocaust in a dignified manner, acknowledge the responsibility of the Hungarian State, and bow our heads before the victims who became victims of the Holocaust also on account of the fact that the Hungarian State was unable to protect them and took part in their transportation from Hungary to concentration camps,&quot; the Hungarian government said in a statement to Haaretz.</p> \n<p>But despite all the good intentions, it’s clear that phrases such as “was unable to protect them” will reignite the dispute over Hungary’s involvement in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>For now, efforts are underway in Hungary to reach as broad a consensus as possible to open the museum. On Thursday, Hungarian officials met with representatives of Yad Vashem. No details were released, no new plan was presented, and Yad Vashem’s objection to opening the museum hasn’t changed.</p> \n<p>Excluded from the discussion is the Foreign Ministry, which also opposes the launching of the museum.</p> \n<p>Not everyone is optimistic about these talks. “The Foreign Ministry has very good people who know the story, and I assume they’re not excited about the contacts between the two countries,” Bauer said.</p> \n<p>He says some officials aren’t doing enough. “The Israeli government has ministers who find the matter uncomfortable, but they won’t make a scandal out of it because all it is is the Holocaust,” Bauer said. “Who cares about that?”</p> \n<p>The view from Poland</p> \n<p>This is very similar to what happened with the Israeli-Polish statement signed by Netanyahu and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki during the summer on the controversy surrounding Poland’s controversial “Holocaust law.”</p> \n<p>Bauer says Israel completely surrendered on the issue, with the joint statement almost completely accepting the Polish narrative that glorifies the role of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations and minimizes the Poles’ role in Nazi crimes during the Holocaust. As Bauer puts it, this is because of political considerations that subordinate Holocaust remembrance to economic, security and diplomatic interests.</p> \n<p>Back in Hungary, there’s no rush. The government said a Holocaust museum and remembrance center has been operating in Budapest for nearly 20 years, with government support, so there’s no reason to rush to open the House of Fates before an amicable solution is found. After a concept for the new museum is agreed on, the matter will be discussed with a wide range of groups.</p> \n<p>When asked about Jewish life in Hungary under Orban’s right-wing nationalist government, Heisler painted a complex picture. “We have constructive cooperation with the government,” he said, adding that this was expressed in solid government funding for Jewish institutions including the renovation of synagogues, cemeteries and hospitals. Jews also enjoy full freedom of religion.</p> \n<p>“As opposed to Jewish communities in Western Europe, in Hungary they declared that [kosher slaughter] and circumcision are part of freedom of religion,” Heisler said. “And in Hungary there are no physical attacks on Jews. Nothing. Zero. We can walk safely with a kippa on the street.”</p> \n<p>In the same breath he mentioned his meeting with Orban about a year ago in which he asked for help renovating a Budapest synagogue damaged by an electrical fire. The last rabbi to survive the Holocaust in Hungary prays there, Heisler told Orban. Ten days later, the government approved a budget for repairing the synagogue. “He’s a serious politician who makes promises and keeps his promises,” Heisler said.</p> \n<p>Still, he notes the large percentage of Hungarians who still hold anti-Semitic opinions. “Twenty percent of the public – this is one of the worst rates in Europe, and it’s very bad,” Heisler said.</p> \n<p>Thus it’s vital to preserve an “independent, strong and proud” Jewish community, one unwilling to compromise over its historical narrative, Heisler says. He says many people close to or in the government are trying to cover up or change history, but standing behind the Jewish community are 600,000 martyrs – the number of Hungarian Jews murdered in the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>So he acted last year when Orban praised Miklos Horthy, the Hungarian leader who aided the Nazis during World War II, for his accomplishments as an officer during World War I. The fact that Hungary wasn’t crushed “underneath the foot of history, well, this is thanks to a handful of exceptional statesmen,” Orban said of Horthy, putting him first on a short list with two others. “This fact cannot be doubted” despite Hungary’s “mournful participation” in World War II, Orban added.</p> \n<p>Heisler is alarmed by such attempts to put a positive spin on Horthy’s name. “For us, he’s one of those most responsible for the murder of 600,000 people. There are those in the government who are trying to transfer all the responsibility for it to the Germans. It’s the main problem,” Heisler said.</p> \n<p>During his visit to Israel, Heisler took part in a happy event Thursday: the celebration of the 100th birthday of the Jewish-Hungarian newspaper Uj Kelet, now published in Israel. Among the luminaries who have written for it are journalist and lawyer Rudolf Kastner, film director and screenwriter Ephraim Kishon, and journalist and politician Yosef Lapid.</p> \n<p>Heisler says the Hungarian government helps finance the paper as part of Budapest’s attempt to preserve Hungarian tradition all over the world. “The situation isn’t as black as they think in Israel,” he said. “But it’s not as white either, as we dream about at home.”</p>",

The analyst, who cited American, European and Saudi sources, reported that&nbsp;Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&nbsp;was interested in purchasing Israeli software because he was impressed by&nbsp;Israel's cyber capabilities.</p> \n<p>The two American sources told the Post that the Saudis worked through a Luxembourg-based affiliate of NSO called Q Cyber Technologies. Q Cyber promised the Saudis access to targets in six Middle Eastern countries and directly assisted them in solving problems with the cyber-monitoring systems that they provided, the report said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli cyber firm negotiated advanced attack capabilities sale with Saudis, Haaretz reveals&nbsp;■&nbsp;Revealed: Israel's cyber-spy industry helps world dictators hunt dissidents and gays&nbsp;■&nbsp;The dark side of Israeli technology: Six takes on the sale of cyberattack firm NSO&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Sources told the Post that the Israeli government authorized the transaction despite certain Israeli officials' hesitations over granting Arab regimes access to such technology.

Obviously, there are sometimes abuses,&quot; he added.</p> \n<p>In response to an Haaretz query, NSO commented that &quot;the company develops products that are sold only to authorized government entities who are trained for the exclusive goal of investigating and preventing&nbsp; crime and terror.&quot;</p> \n<p>Israel's Defense Ministry stated that &quot;the Defense Export Control Agency (DECA) strictly provides licenses to security exporters in accordance to the law, the standards and the commitments that&nbsp;the State of Israel is committed to, in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government entities. The Defense Ministry does not provide details about the Israeli government's policy on giving export licenses or about the licenses themselves for defense and strategic reasons. For this reason, we cannot comment on the question whether the aforementioned license exists.&quot;</p> \n<p>Last week, Montreal-based Saudi activist Omar Abdulaziz launched a lawsuit against Israeli cyber company NSO, claiming that the company's software was used to hack his cellphone in order to track conversations with murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>&quot;The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,&quot; Abdulaziz told CNN. &quot;The guilt is killing me.&quot;</p> \n<p>Abdulaziz's lawsuit against NSO comes a month after a Haaretz investigation revealed that the company negotiated the sale of advanced cyber-attack capabilities with Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>The Israeli company offered Saudi Arabia a system that hacks cellphones, a few months before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman began his purge of regime opponents, according to a complaint under investigation by Israel Police.</p> \n<p>In November, Amnesty International Israel asked the Defense Ministry to revoke cyber firm NSO's defense export license, saying it had been proven that its software had been used in &quot;a series of egregious human rights violations.&quot; &quot;NSO is out of control,&quot; Amnesty Israel said.</p> \n<p>Sources in the Defense Ministry agency that oversees defense exports said it was strict about granting licenses according to the law and that they could not discuss the existence of NSO's license for security reasons.</p> \n<p>Amnesty Israel rejected the response and said it intended to pursue legal action.</p> \n<p>In October, the Citizen Lab research group said it had “high confidence” that the Saudi government used NSO’s Pegasus software to eavesdrop on Saudi dissident Abdulaziz.

A single ray of light was issued from the president's residence, clarifying that in Israel there are still those who are willing to draw a red line.&quot;</p> \n<p>Salvini is the leader of the far-right Northern League party, and is known especially for his strong resistance to the intake of migrants and asylum seekers in his country.</p> \n<p>In the past, his party mostly represented&nbsp;separatists from northern Italy, but under his leadership the Northern League became more popular at a national level, partly due to his attacks on foreigners.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The party became the second-largest faction in the Italian parliament after the recent elections, and Salvini entered his position in June when the Italian government was sworn in.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>While he holds the position of interior minister, Salvini's dominance casts a heavy shadow over Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte; some even claim that Salvini is the one dictating the country's agenda.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Italy's new populist rulers love Putin, hate immigrants and are confused about Israel | Analysis</p> \n<p>In the initial days of his term, Salvini issued an order not to allow a migrant rescue ship to dock on Italy’s shores. The Aquarius boat had 629 asylum seekers on board who had been rescued from the sea off the Libyan coast, among them 134 unaccompanied minors, seven pregnant women and several people in critical condition with hypothermia.</p> \n<p>Salvini also touched of a storm by his call for a special census of Roma in Italy.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper this past month, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Roberto Fico said Italy was weighing the possibility of opening a cultural mission in Jerusalem, as the Czech Republic has done. Fico told Eldad Beck that there’s been a significant shift in Europe’s understanding of Israel and its policies and that European parliament elections being held in May 2019 “may bring about a change in the European institution’s approach if parties of the new right become stronger.”</p> \n<p>Salvini's visit comes on the heels of multiple meetings Netanyahu has held with leaders who are associated with the far right across the world or politicians who have joined far-right parties. Recently, Czech President&nbsp; Milos Zeman visited Israel and addressed his promise to move his country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem-- a move his government opposes and that is not under his authority to decide on.</p> \n<p>In September,&nbsp;Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is accused of violating human rights in his country, also paid a visit to Israel. In July, Hungary's Viktor Orban, who leads a counter-democratic policy, came to the Holy Land.&nbsp;A month earlier, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who is spearheading efforts to end the Israeli boycott on far-right ministers in his government, also visited Israel.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu recently declared that he would participate in the swearing-in ceremony of Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who is also perceived to be on the far right side of the political map.

        "text":["<p>Charlotte Adelman’s life has been one long saga of miracles and tragedies.</p> \n<p>The 86-year-old was only nine years old when the Nazis invaded Paris, where she lived with her parents and brother. Two years into the Nazi occupation of France, Charlotte’s mother Rajzla took Charlotte and her brother to an orphanage, hoping to save them; Charlotte’s brother later came down with scarlet fever and died. Charlotte was then adopted. The other 79 children who remained in the orphanage were later killed in Auschwitz. Meanwhile, Charlotte’s parents were sent to Auschwitz; her father Herszle escaped during the journey, but her mother died in the camp,&nbsp;ABC News reports.</p> \n<p>The woman who adopted Charlotte was in the habit of selling children to Nazis. But soon, a family friend discovered Charlotte and reconnected her with her father. Herszle Adelman smuggled her out of Paris on a truck, taking her to a small town in northern France where the Quatreville family, whom he had met by chance, agreed to take Charlotte in and hide her from the Nazis. Herszle left, to join the resistance. And though the Quatrevilles had two children, and barely knew Herszle, they successfully hid Charlotte in their cellar for nine months until the end of the war.</p> \n<p>After seventy years, Charlotte Adelman reunited with the Quatreville children in Paris in November. They met at the Wall of Names, where her mother’s name is memorialized. On Tuesday, Charlotte&nbsp;shared with People&nbsp;that she first heard from Alain Quatreville, who was just four years old when she moved in with the family, on Facebook. “I never forgot the Quatrevilles,” she said. “I was pinching myself.”</p> \n<p>Charlotte, who now lives in Arizona, was bolstered by her community, which launched a GoFundMe to raise money to send her on the trip with one of her daughters.</p> \n<p>After lighting a candle together for Charlotte Adelman’s mother at the memorial site, Charlotte Adelman and Quatreville, a 78-year-old retired math professor, travelled to the Quatrevilles’ village, where the family had kept her hidden. There, Charlotte reunited with Ginette Quatreville, Alain Quatreville’s 93-year-old older sister, who used to sneak into the cellar to give Charlotte sponge baths during her months of hiding.</p> \n<p>“It brought it all back,” Charlotte said. “It was very emotional. It reminded me I never knew how I was going to get out.”</p> \n<p>The long-lost friends agreed that the absence of the Quatrevilles’ mother was strongly felt. Alain Quatreville said that the family was never sure what happened to Charlotte after she fell out of touch, and that his mother died not knowing of her whereabouts. “This reunion would have meant so much more to my mother,” he said. “I think of her especially. She would’ve been very happy.”</p> \n<p>Since they met in November, Adelman and the Quatrevilles have remained in close contact.</p> \n<p>For more stories, go to www.forward.com.

But since he put up a house on a nearby field in 2016, he has paid $4,500 in fines for building on agricultural land.</p> \n<p>“There was no alternative,” said Abd al-Hamid, 30, who works for a Cairo security company, standing in front of his pink-painted house in the Nile Delta. “Am I supposed to rent an apartment in Cairo? I can’t afford that.”</p> \n<p>Egypt’s population of nearly 100 million is growing rapidly and about 38 million live in unplanned communities.</p> \n<p>In the turmoil after the 2011 Arab Spring, the number of unlicensed buildings sky-rocketed. Now authorities are cracking down on residents who build on farmland, but are providing few alternatives for those who need cheap houses.</p> \n<p>People who build on agricultural land now face up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 5 million Egyptian pounds ($280,000). Before the law was revised in January, the top fine was 50,000 pounds ($2,800) and the prison term wasn’t specified.</p> \n<p>Authorities say they want to end unlicensed building on farmland, reduce overcrowding and provide homes for the poor, but analysts say many new government housing projects are too expensive and have poor services.</p> \n<p>As a result, large numbers of new homes are unoccupied, while people still build on farmland in areas where housing demand is high.</p> \n<p>“This shows you it’s a distorted housing market and price incentives and accessibility have not worked out,” said Michele Dunne, director of the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank.</p> \n<p>Under President Abdel-Fattah al-Sissi, the military has been seeking ways to tighten control over the population, she said.</p> \n<p>“And one of these ways seems to be controlling real estate development and channeling people toward the communities the government is building rather than communities that sprout out organically in places where people want to live.”</p> \n<p>The military owns 51 percent of a firm that is developing a new capital east of Cairo. Since the 2011 revolution, nearly 85,000 acres of farmland have been lost to illegal construction, according to data from the ministry of agriculture.</p> \n<p>That’s a 40 percent average annual increase compared to before 2011, according to a Reuters calculation based on data going back to 1983. Of those 85,000 acres, 28,000 have been cleared of buildings, but most is not being farmed, the ministry said.</p> \n<p>On Monday, the government started a campaign to demolish unlicensed buildings from 19,000 acres of farmland. “Look at the size of the encroachments on agricultural land,”&nbsp;al-Sissi said in September.</p> \n<p>“If it continues at this rate ... then we will have unplanned growth that requires spending on healthcare that’s not available, clean water that’s not available, roads and electricity networks that are not available. That can’t be.”</p> \n<p>The Nile Delta, one of the most densely populated parts of the country, is also one of the hardest hit by unlicensed construction on farmland.</p> \n<p>“Where else should we build?” said Sahar Fathi Ayed, 40, Abd al-Hamid’s sister, who has built a house on the family’s fields in the village of Ikyad Dijwi. “Our children got older and wanted to get married and there are no rental apartments here,” she said.</p> \n<p>Lack of housing is no excuse for building on farmland, said Hamed Abd al-Dayem, spokesman for the ministry of agriculture. In an effort to tackle its growing housing needs, Egypt has launched a series of housing projects and is developing 42 new cities, but many are underoccupied.</p> \n<p>New Cairo, Sheikh Zayed and Shorouk have occupancy rates of 65 percent, 50 percent and 55 percent, respectively, according to Leilani Farha, UN special rapporteur on housing.</p> \n<p>One of the more established new cities, 6th of October, has an occupancy rate of 75 percent, she said. People in some new cities have limited access to schools, clinics, emergency services, transport and food, she said.</p> \n<p>“There also appears to be a lack of income mix within housing estates and a tendency towards gated communities for upper income housing,” Farha wrote in a statement following a visit to Egypt last month.</p> \n<p>The government does have a social housing program for low and middle-income families, she said, but only 2.2 percent of all social housing benefits Egyptians with the lowest incomes.</p> \n<p>Jamal al-Sayed, who left farming when fuel for his tractors became too expensive, sees no alternative to building on his farmland.</p> \n<p>“I built a house for my son so he could get married,” said Sayed, 53, who now works in a bakery. “There’s a lack of housing in our town. So I built on the land that I own.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel, Jews, and gays could harm 'national foundations', Egypt says | Analysis</p> \n<p>Homes in the town are small and people are forced to build when their families expand. He has paid 60,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,000) in fines since he built the house in 2013.</p> \n<p>Residential land tends to be expensive, said Kevin Graham, the Oxford Business Group’s editorial manager in Egypt. “Developers pick up this land but end up often building very high-cost homes rather than affordable homes,” he said.</p> \n<p>Stricter punishment for building on farmland is part of the government’s effort to boost revenue through taxation, he said.</p> \n<p>“But in order for it to really be a solution, other options must be made available to those driven to build outside of the formal system,” he said.</p> \n<p>Egypt is the world’s top wheat importer and authorities want to end building on farmland and grow more at home. The government is also trying to reclaim areas in the desert for agricultural use, said General Mohamed Helmy Abd el-Hamed Rashwan, executive manager of The General Authority for Rehabilitation Projects and Agricultural Development at the ministry of agriculture.</p> \n<p>“It can’t be right that while we’re trying to cultivate the desert we are losing beautiful Egyptian farmland,” he said. “Agricultural land is a red line.”</p>",

Rain is likely in the coming week, though less of it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The center of the country saw 200 to 250 millimeters (9.8 inches) but the north saw less – 60 to 70 millimeters – not enough to fill the northern streams that lead to Lake Kinneret and raise its level.</p> \n<p>“This is nice but not enough,” Malik said. “If the amounts that fell in central Israel had fallen in the north, it would have been better for Lake Kinneret, so it hasn’t risen by much.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The level of the lake – a key source of water – rose only 4 centimeters, still 162 centimeters from the upper red line, the point where the lake could overflow if its dam is not opened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Malik said the wintry weather was caused by cold air from Eastern Europe passing over the Mediterranean, which is still relatively warm. “This leads to very well-developed clouds that bring large quantities of rain,” he said.</p> \n<p>At the Atarot industrial zone in north Jerusalem, a 50-year-old worker was killed Friday when a factory wall collapsed on him due to the heavy rain. Rescue workers needed hours to remove the body, and the factory owner has been detained for questioning.</p> \n<p>Near the southern city of Kiryat Gat, a 30-year-old woman and her 1-year-old were killed when the vehicle they were in veered off course and crashed. The flow rate in the Ayalon Stream, which leads from the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea via Tel Aviv, reached 250 cubic meters per second, the highest rate since January 2012 and the third highest since 1992.</p> \n<p>Waves on the Mediterranean reached 3 to 6 meters due to strong winds of 30 to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour. The storm also brought the season’s first snowfall to Mount Hermon in the Golan Heights.</p> \n<p>More than 80 residents of Moshav Ahi’ezer, southwest of Ben-Gurion International Airport, were evacuated from their homes. Some said they had to wait several hours trapped at home before the rescue services reached them.</p> \n<p>Some houses and cars were flooded and damaged, but no casualties were reported. Electricity and gas supplies to Ahi’ezer were cut.</p> \n<p>The head of the local fire and rescue service said Ahi’ezer was the hardest hit of any community in Israel over the weekend; residents had to be evacuated using boats and tractors.</p> \n<p>“I could see the stream of water reach the house,” said one of the residents who was evacuated to a local community center. “We had no time to move anything, and the water was as high as the couch and the bed,” said the woman, who gave her name as Einav.</p> \n<p>The head of the Sdot Dan Regional Council head, David Ifrah, said floods occurred every winter, but they have seldom been this grave.&nbsp;Several roads were flooded by the rainwater, and some drivers had to be rescued.</p> \n<p>Because of the flooding the Ayalon Highway was closed for five hours from the Glilot Interchange, just north of Tel Aviv, to the Ganot Interchange, south of the city. Route 40, which connects central Israel to southern towns, was closed near Rehovot.</p> \n<p>For the first time this winter, snow fell on Mount Hermon. About 5 centimeters (2 inches) of snow stuck on the upper slopes, while snow mixed with rain fell on the lower slopes. On Thursday, 50 children and two teachers were evacuated by dinghy after a kindergarten complex flooded in Rehovot.</p> \n<p>Flash floods have been likely in the Judean Desert and Jordan Valley, with haze in the south.&nbsp;The rains tapered off Saturday but will continue on and off in the north and center. Temperatures will be lower than normal for this time of year.</p> \n<p>Sunday will be partly cloudy and temperatures will inch up to seasonal averages. Scattered showers are still likely Sunday morning in the north and along the coast.</p> \n<p>Monday will be partly cloudy, with scattered showers and stronger winds in the north. Tuesday will be nice, but Wednesday will see showers in the north and center, and light rain in the Negev.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Three days after the exposure of the attack tunnels that Hezbollah dug into Israeli territory under the Lebanon border, the significance of the discovery is becoming clearer. After the criticism of the IDF media blitz and the political leveraging by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it’s best not to lose sight of the military implications of the events. After years of searching, the army located a vital component of Hezbollah’s offensive plans in the north.</p> \n<p>If the confidence that the intelligence community is expressing in its information proves to be well-founded, Israel is hoping to deprive the enemy of an important capability upon which a portion of its preparations for a future war relied. (This war is not erupting yet because at present is still does not serve the interests of either side.) Hezbollah’s rocket arsenal and its attempt to upgrade their level of precision are still its top priority, but the tunnels were also a critical aspect of its program.</p> \n<p>When Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah first began issuing threats about his organization’s intention “to conquer the Galilee” in the next war, Israel was initially dismissive. But after Nasrallah kept saying the same thing in public, Israel’s military intelligence seriously set about trying to decipher his meaning.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;A Hezbollah Blitzkrieg: Tunnels of Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;■&nbsp;The battle over the timing of Israel's operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Why would Nasrallah boast in this way when the most his organization could hope to do was send a few cells of attackers across the border for a surprise attack on a single community? Even Hezbollah couldn’t turn a few rocket barrages on the Israeli home front into a victory photo.</p> \n<p>The answer gradually became clear only after the 2014 Gaza war. Israel realized that Hezbollah was aiming to copy the Hamas model of attack tunnels, in a slightly different form.</p> \n<p>The tunnels it dug, which apparently were fewer in number and shorter, were designed to meet the specific needs of the northern front: the quick and secret transfer of hundreds of fighters from the outskirts of the villages in southern Lebanon into Israel, thus to lay the groundwork for a wider ground offensive that would immediately follow.</p> \n<p>The balance of power between the sides is clear. Hezbollah, with no air force, would not be able to maintain any strongholds it seizes in the Galilee for long, but the shock that such a surprise attack would have on the Israeli public would be enough to give Hezbollah an image of victory, and all the Israeli air strikes and ground incursions that would ensue inside Lebanon would not erase this impression.</p> \n<p>Nasrallah understands Israeli society’s DNA very well, as a member of the IDF general staff said the other day. The tunnel plan was directed precisely at this. “This was the cornerstone of Hezbollah’s approach, a move that was supposed to take us by surprise without us knowing what hit us.”</p> \n<p>Asked how critical this operation was at this time, given the criticism in the media and the questions that have arisen in the political arena, his response was unexpectedly forceful: Had war broken out and we had left this threat untreated, the Agranat Commission’s criticisms of the IDF following the Yom Kippur War would have paled in comparison to what would have happened in this case, and rightly so. “We could not go on living with this threat for one day. And this is a genuine answer, not covering our ass.”</p> \n<p>The suspicious Lebanese factory</p> \n<p>The effort to locate the tunnels, which was coordinated by army intelligence and the IDF Northern Command with the aid of technology and engineering units, covered a very extensive area along 130 kilometers of the border fence. It was some time before a breakthrough was achieved. The teams of experts identified methods of operation and looked for unusual characteristics. At the same time, the area was analyzed from what would be Hezbollah’s vantage point: Which roads and sites are vital to Israel and where are the vulnerable spots that would allow access to them?</p> \n<p>The IDF spent many months searching before it found the tunnel next to Metula, whose entry shaft on the Lebanese side was dug beneath a cement block factory in Kafr Kila. When the army noticed that the factory was not receiving materials but just transporting cargo from the site on trucks, it realized what was really going on there.</p> \n<p>By the summer, conditions were ripe to launch an engineering operation. Brig. Gen. Dror Shalom, head of Military Intelligence’s research department, felt that more information was still needed to have the most accurate intelligence and be certain that the tunnels would be found. Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, MI chief Tamir Heyman and Northern Command head Yoel Strick felt it was time to act.</p> \n<p>Eisenkot permitted Shalom to present his minority position to the cabinet as well. Meanwhile, a debate arose over which action was more important. Avigdor Lieberman, who was still defense minister, felt that the threat in the north was not as urgent as the ongoing escalation in the south. Lieberman also suspected that Eisenkot was using the need for an operation in the north as an excuse to justify avoiding an operation against Hamas in Gaza.</p> \n<p>When Eisenkot became chief of staff in February 2015, he cited the removal of enemy tunnels into Israel as a top priority. The trauma of the tunnels in Operation Protective Edge was still fresh and the defense establishment had begun a major project (budgeted at close to 4 billion shekels, or just over $1 billion) to build the tunnel barrier wall and develop technology to locate the tunnels.</p> \n<p>In early 2017, credible information about tunnels on the Lebanon border began to accumulate as well. Eisenkot pushed to advance the move. We can’t repeat the mistake of hoping that the tunnels will grow rusty like the rockets, he told his people, alluding to former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya’alon’s controversial statement prior to the Second Lebanon War.</p> \n<p>But more time passed until the army had solid and sufficiently detailed information on the northern tunnels, and other challenges popped up in the interim. Israel began a campaign to strike Iranian targets in Syria with the aim of halting the entrenchment of the Revolutionary Guards and the Shi’ite militias there.</p> \n<p>In the summer of 2018, with the tension rising over the incendiary kites and balloons on the Gazan border, the northern operation was postponed once more, though Eisenkot insisted that it not be put off as late as winter. It would be negligent not to start dealing with the tunnels in the north, he argued.</p> \n<p>In September, the planned operation was presented to Netanyahu and then, on November 7, to the cabinet. In the cabinet discussion, Lieberman said again that the threat was less urgent than portrayed by the army and that the most necessary move at this time was a ground incursion against Hamas in Gaza.</p> \n<p>During the interlude, in October, Eisenkot traveled to the United States and presented the tunnel threat to the American administration for the first time. Netanyahu also discussed it early in the week at his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels. The prime minister had many topics to discuss with Pompeo. The operation to locate the tunnels was first on the list.</p> \n<p>So what will Hezbollah do now? The defense establishment is somewhat surprised by the relative quiet with which the Israeli action along the northern border was received in Lebanon this week. The sense is that Hezbollah genuinely did not anticipate the Israeli move and is still assessing the impact of its lost military assets that were exposed. However, Nasrallah is unlikely to let Israeli propaganda go unchecked for very long.</p> \n<p>For now, a military escalation does not seem to be in the offing. And yet, the continued efforts to locate the tunnels will generate tension on both sides of the border, with an even more challenging problem for Israel lurking just around the corner: the Iranian effort to build production lines in Lebanon for systems that will improve the precision of Hezbollah’s rockets.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and other Israeli spokespeople have stated again and again that Israel will not allow such factories to be built. The fuse that could ignite the next war has already been shown to us. At the same time, many voices are still pressing for restraint. But all signs indicate that 2019 is going to be extra tense on the security front, regardless of when the next Israeli elections are held.</p>",

        "text":["<p>High-tech companies have not been a prominent part of the current protests against domestic violence, and the few companies that have publicly expressed support for the campaign have limited their statements to expressing opposition to murder and physical violence against women. But violence can take many forms, and there is also room for self-examination in the high-tech industry.</p> \n<p>Just look at the following comments, submitted to a closed Facebook group for women working in local high-tech. They describe sexist jokes in meetings and on group WhatsApp messages, sexual harassment in the office gym, male colleagues viewing pornography at work and colleagues’ comments about women being inferior at certain types of jobs. This is not physical violence, but this is exactly the kind of thing that helps to preserve a sexist power structure and also enables violence to occur.</p> \n<p>The low rates of women working at high-tech firms (35 percent),&nbsp;and specifically in R&amp;D high-skilled technological positions (24 percent), are generally ascribed to their tendency not to choose these paths in high school and higher education. But the work culture reflected in the testimonies collected here also plays a key role in one of the less talked-about problems in the industry: In many cases, women who have acquired the relevant skills end up leaving the field or not going into it at all.</p> \n<p>A joint Labor Ministry and Finance Ministry study conducted in 2017 by Yael Mazuz Harpaz and Zeev Krill found that the rate of female graduates of academic programs in computer science who end up working in the industry was 68 percent, compared to 76 percent for men. But the closer they get to age 40, the greater the discrepancy becomes. The same goes for their wages. Women in the early stages of their high-tech careers earn 7 percent less on average than men their age, and as they approach 40, the wage gap grows to 18 percent. The researchers attribute some of this gap to differences in bargaining ability and fewer opportunities for advancement. Whatever the reasons, wage discrimination is also a type of violence.</p> \n<p>Supporting the cause, not the women</p> \n<p>In July, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to protest the newly passed surrogacy law [that did not extend the right to surrogacy to single men and same-sex couple] in what was called the largest social protest since the summer of 2011. High-tech firms from the largest companies to the smallest startups very openly sided with the protesters, sending out strong messages of support.</p> \n<p>Company spokespeople and PR agents sent out emails and other messages, and made phone calls until all hours of the night to ensure that their clients appeared on the publicized lists of companies supporting the cause. They were not deterred by the moral debate surrounding the surrogacy issue. Some companies announced they would give employees significant amounts of money to help them with surrogacy efforts abroad. Those who wished to avoid talking about surrogacy spoke about LGBT rights.</p> \n<p>But now, not only are the high-tech companies not leading the protest against violence against women, their support has been tepid at best. Just take a look at the brief list of companies supporting the protest that was published here on Tuesday. Not one representative of a high-tech company called to complain that his company was not mentioned. The only phone call that did come was from a large company that asked to have its name removed for fear that the phrase “partial strike” would adversely affect it.</p> \n<p>With the LGBT protest, it was almost as if there was a competition regarding reputation and exposure – who is the first to come out in support, who is giving more, who will put up a billboard on the Ayalon Freeway, who will hire a bus to transport employees to show their support for equality. A day off to attend the protest was considered a basic benefit.</p> \n<p>But yesterday, the companies that so prominently supported the earlier protest weren’t talking about hiring buses or anything of the kind. At most, they asked employees to wear black to work and allowed them to leave work for a few hours to attend the demonstration.</p> \n<p>Instead of trying to interest media outlets in publishing images of their own employees at demonstrations, as the protests were underway, one PR agency sent out an email touting a study about online shopping during Cyber Week.</p> \n<p>The few companies that did take part in the protest did not talk about women’s rights. Their comments were restricted to the subject of murder and physical violence, essentially leaving the issue of women’s rights as someone else’s problem that has nothing to do with the privileged world of the technology industry. But violence comes in many shades and, unfortunately, gender stereotypes, wage gaps, discrimination and the glass ceiling are all to be found in Israeli high-tech.</p>",

The band was to have performed three concerts, in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Be’er Sheva, at the beginning of next month.</p> \n<p>In a letter on his social media pages, Waters wrote: “I am aghast to see you have plans to perform in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Be’er Sheva on 4th, 5th, 6th January. Please don’t do it. To sing my songs in front of segregated audiences in Israel, and contribute to the cultural whitewashing of the racist and apartheid government of that country, would be an act of unconscionable malice and disrespect...</p> \n<p>“Have you ever actually listened to the work that you perform to make a living? The people that you intend to entertain are executing their neighbor’s children, shooting them down in cold blood every day. In the name of everything that is human, please hear my call and cancel today.”</p> \n<p>Waters added a photo to his post of an injured Palestinian child being treated by a Red Crescent medic.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; 'Wish you weren’t here': Is Roger Waters a peace activist or an anti-Semite?</p> \n<p>UK Pink Floyd Experience announced the cancellation on its Facebook page shortly after Waters’ letter was posted and proceeded to remove the planned concert dates from its website. Later, apparently due to a large number of responses, it removed its Facebook page entirely.</p> \n<p>According to Egoist Productions, which was bringing the group to Israel, the band members – who have already performed in Israel, in 2017 – were under direct personal pressure from a large number of other activists.</p> \n<p>In a statement, the company said: “Yesterday, Pink Floyd band member Roger Waters began an unprecedented PR campaign with the purpose of preventing the members of UK Pink Floyd Experience from coming to Israel for three concerts planned for early January. Despite attempts by Egoist Productions to oppose the move, we were unable to stop the flood, which reached its peak when the phone numbers of the band members were made public and they began to be harassed to the point where they had to disconnect their phones.”</p> \n<p>Egoist added that despite this, it had continued all night after the band canceled to attempt to persuade them not to do so. “After the band announced the cancellation on its Facebook page, we saw responses by thousands of Israelis who expressed their opinion about the cancellation. The situation became so extreme that the band took down its Facebook page.”</p> \n<p>However, the statement by Egoist continued, “over the past few hours, the band has asked to wait with an official answer, in an attempt to keep to the contract it signed, and to hold the concerts. We all hope that our efforts over the past 24 hours will be fruitful and the concerts will take place as planned.”</p>",

It sends a wrong message if we discontinue our support,&quot; he told a security forum in the United Arab Emirates.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The United States last month halted U.S. refuelling of aircraft from the coalition, which has been blamed for air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians in Yemen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The U.S. official's reassurances of continued support comes as Sweden hosts the first UN-led peace talks in two years between the warring parties and as Gulf Arab leaders hold an annual summit in Riyadh on Sunday, expected to discuss the war.&nbsp;  Containing Iran&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lenderking said peace talks launched last week were a &quot;vital first step&quot; in ending the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions facing starvation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said there were no illusions the process would be easy, but that there were signs of constructive talks and that Washington wants concrete results from the meetings focused on confidence-building measures and a transitional governing body.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Looking down the road we seek a stable and unified Yemen that fosters rather than drains regional and global stability.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is no place in a future Yemen for an Iranian-backed threat to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and vital international economic quarters,&quot; he said, adding that the coalition was also combating al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants in Yemen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Arabian Peninsula country lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The conflict, seen largely in the region as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran, pits the Houthi movement against other Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which is backed by the coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Houthis, who have fired missiles on Saudi cities, took control of the capital Sanaa after ousting Hadi's government from there in 2014, and the most populous areas of the country. Hadi's government has a base in the southern port of Aden.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Lenderking said that experts forecast there could be 1 million former combatants that need to be disarmed once a peace deal is reached, requiring security sector reform as well as restoring crippled infrastructure and shoring up the economy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Early recovery efforts are underway but full scale reconstruction can only occur in a peaceful environment. For that reason we want to close the space for malign Iranian influence.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

Manelis noted in a statement that the tunnel is situated in an area afflicted by difficult weather conditions, which have plagued Israel in recent days.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Manelis said in his statement that the tunnel was not prepared for military operations, &quot;did not pose a danger and does not pose one now.&quot;</p> \n<p>The uncovering of the tunnel took place amid an Israel campaign to locate and destroy attack tunnels created by the Shi'ite terror organization. Operation Northern Shield was announced earlier this week,&nbsp;and the army spokesman said that the military will continue with the operation despite the bad weather.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated after the revelation of the tunnel was announced that&nbsp;&quot;The IDF and the security establishment are continuing their work in the north to much success.

We must continue working until it is complete – and this is what we will do.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier Saturday, Israeli troops fired towards three suspects the army believes were Hezbollah operatives who attempted to reach sites where the army is working to destroy tunnels. The suspects crossed the international border between Israel and Lebanon&nbsp;(the Blue Line) but did not breach the border fence. They later fled the scene.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The army spokesman addressed the incident, saying that &quot;today in the afternoon three people in civilian clothing, presumably Hezbollah operatives, arrived at the site and tried to steal technological equipment that was there. Troops fired at the three and they fled.&quot;</p> \n<p>Also Saturday,&nbsp;Netanyahu spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Israeli operation to halt Hezbollah's tunnel construction. The two also discussed enhancing the security coordination between Jerusalem and Moscow.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the military announced that it had uncovered a second Hezbollah tunnel crossing into Israeli territory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – The resolution condemning Hamas, which was presented by the U.S. before the UN General Assembly on Thursday, fell short of the required two-thirds majority and failed to pass.</p> \n<p>The failure is a disappointment for the Trump administration and the Israeli government: both invested diplomatic efforts in getting the resolution to pass, and ran into strong opposition from the Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>The resolution, which did receive the majority of votes, mainly failed to pass because the General Assembly held a separate vote on the size of the majority needed to pass the resolution about 20 minutes before the vote. The U.S. asked that only a simple majority would be needed to pass the resolution, while Kuwait asked for a two-thirds majority. The Kuwaiti request won a slim majority, and as a result, the passage of the anti-Hamas resolution became impossible.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Opinion:&nbsp;How Trump’s anti-Hamas UN resolution is creating unusual Palestinian unity&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The final tally was 87 votes in favor of the resolution, 57 against and 36 abstentions.</p> \n<p>All the Arab countries voted against the resolution, despite a concentrated effort by the Trump administration in recent days to ensure their support. Even Arab countries that have reportedly warmed up to Israel recently, such as Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman, voted against denouncing Hamas on the world stage. The same was true for Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan.</p> \n<p>This result represents a failure for the Trump administration’s strategy of trying to convince the Arab world to break away from the Palestinian position. The Arab countries also supported the earlier vote demanding a two-thirds majority in order to pass the resolution, thus ensuring its failure.</p> \n<p>The resolution on Hamas was also seen as the last major vote in which Nikki Haley, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the UN, will be involved. Haley announced in October that she is&nbsp;resigning from her post. Two White House officials said late Thursday that Trump will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert,&nbsp;a former Fox News correspondent and anchor with no prior policy or political experience, as ambassador.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on the vote saying, &quot;The draft condemnation of Hamas in the UN General Assembly received a sweeping majority by countries that stood against Hamas. While it did not achieve a two-thirds majority, this is the first time that a majority of countries have voted against Hamas and I commend each of the 87 countries that took a principled stand against Hamas. This is a very important achievement for the U.S. and Israel. I thank the American administration and U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley for the initiative.&quot;</p> \n<p>The UN General Assembly also voted on a&nbsp; second resolution offered by Ireland and pushed by the Palestinian Authority, in favor of a two-state solution. It includes condemnation of Israeli settlements and a reference to the parameters of a future peace agreement.</p> \n<p>The resolution passed overwhelmingly, with 156 countries voting in favor. Only Israel, the U.S., Australia, Liberia and the Marshall Islands voted against it.</p> \n<p>Originally, the Palestinian Authority was trying to propose amendments to the U.S.-supported resolution on Hamas, such as adding to the text a condemnation of Israeli policies in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. The Trump administration fought against the amendment and sent letters to a number of key Arab countries asking them to support the resolution, as reported on Tuesday in Haaretz.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East peace process,&nbsp;Jason Greenblatt, has asked Arab countries to support the resolution based on the fact that they oppose terrorism and want stability in the region.&nbsp;In a letter addressed to diplomats from Morocco, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Qatar, Greenblatt called on the Arab countries&nbsp;to ignore the Palestinians' opposition to the resolution.</p> \n<p>Greenblatt wrote the diplomats that the PA's resistance to the resolution was hypocritical, seeing as the PA views Hamas as an opponent and sanctions the group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Following the vote, Israel's envoy to the UN Danny Danon tweeted: &quot;For the first time at the UN, a record 87 countries condemned Hamas for its rocket fire and use of civilian infrastructure for military purposes against Israel. I thank Nikki Haley for her hard work in forming an unprecedented coalition. We will continue to fight for the truth!&quot;</p> \n<p>Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas political bureau, called the result an important achievement for the entire Palestinian people and all the countries that took a moral stance and voted against the resolution.</p> \n<p>Haniyeh said he appreciated the efforts made by the Palestinian Authority and its ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, and that this proves the Palestinian national issue can unite the Palestinian people against the challenges it faces.&nbsp;</p>",

It sends a wrong message if we discontinue our support,&quot; he told a security forum in the United Arab Emirates.</p> \n<p>The United States last month halted U.S. refuelling of aircraft from the coalition, which has been blamed for air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians in Yemen.</p> \n<p>The U.S. official's reassurances of continued support comes as Sweden hosts the first U.N.-led peace talks in two years between the warring parties and as Gulf Arab leaders hold an annual summit in Riyadh on Sunday, expected to discuss the war.</p> \n<p>CONTAINING IRAN</p> \n<p>Lenderking said peace talks launched last week were a &quot;vital first step&quot; in ending the conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and left millions facing starvation.</p> \n<p>He said there were no illusions the process would be easy, but that there were signs of constructive talks and that Washington wants concrete results from the meetings focused on confidence-building measures and a transitional governing body.</p> \n<p>&quot;Looking down the road we seek a stable and unified Yemen that fosters rather than drains regional and global stability.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is no place in a future Yemen for an Iranian-backed threat to&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia, the UAE and vital international economic quarters,&quot; he said, adding that the coalition was also combating al Qaeda and Islamic State militants in Yemen.</p> \n<p>The Arabian Peninsula country lies beside the southern mouth of the Red Sea, one of the most important trade routes in the world for oil tankers.</p> \n<p>The conflict, seen largely in the region as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran, pits the Houthi movement against other Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi backed by the coalition led by&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;Arabia and the UAE.</p> \n<p>The Houthis, who have fired missiles on&nbsp;Saudi&nbsp;cities, control the capital Sanaa, after ousting Hadi's government from there in 2014, and the most populous areas of the country. Hadi's government has a base in the southern port of Aden.</p> \n<p>Lenderking said that experts forecast there could be 1 million former combatants that need to be disarmed once a peace deal is reached, requiring security sector reform as well as restoring crippled infrastructure and shoring up the economy.</p> \n<p>&quot;Early recovery efforts are underway but full scale reconstruction can only occur in a peaceful environment. For that reason we want to close the space for malign Iranian influence.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Michelle Goldberg, a columnist for The New York Times, wrote a piece defending anti-Zionism and saying it is not anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“The conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism is a bit of rhetorical sleight-of-hand that depends on treating Israel as the embodiment of the Jewish people everywhere,” she&nbsp;wrote Friday. “Certainly, some criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic, but it’s entirely possible to oppose Jewish ethno-nationalism without being a bigot.”</p> \n<p>The column is a big deal because while The Times opinion page is generally left wing on Israel, most of its columnists who write on the country range from liberal to conservative Zionists.</p> \n<p>Goldberg noted that two incoming Democratic congresswoman, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, have endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel, or&nbsp; BDS. She wrote that many people call BDS anti-Semitic because it subjects&nbsp; Israel to a double standard and, in endorsing a return of Palestinian refugees to Israel, could lead to the end of a Jewish-majority state.</p> \n<p>Indeed, equating BDS with anti-Semitism is the consensus among a broad swath of Jewish organizations; last week, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, representing over 50 Jewish groups, called Pink Floyd front man Roger Waters “anti-Israel and anti-Jewish” for his vocal support of BDS.</p> \n<p>But Goldberg said that opposing Israel and calling for a binational Israeli-Palestinian state is legitimate. She criticized Israel for its government’s close relationship to the Trump administration and right-wing nationalist governments in Europe, as well as for West Bank settlement expansion and the Israeli government’s opposition to Palestinian statehood.</p> \n<p>“As long as the de facto policy of the Israeli government is that there should be only one state in historic Palestine,” Goldberg wrote, “it’s unreasonable to regard Palestinian demands for equal rights in that state as anti-Semitic.”</p>",

The bitter row between Qatar and Saudi Arabia is mired in a diplomatic crisis over the&nbsp;murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Other leaders of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council descended down a golden escalator and were greeted by Saudi King Salman ahead of Sunday's summit. Qatar sent a lower-ranking official.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar in June 2017 over allegations of supporting terrorism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Qatar, which last week abruptly announced it was withdrawing from the oil exporters' group OPEC, denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.</p> \n<p>Qatar's Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani attended last year's meeting in Kuwait, where the boycotting nations sent lower-level representatives. Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid Al Khalifa tweeted that Sheikh Tamim should have accepted &quot;the fair demands and been there at the summit.&quot;</p> \n<p>The one-day annual gathering of leaders from the six member states is expected to focus on security issues, including the Yemen war and Iran's regional activities, and may touch on oil politics and a protracted boycott of Qatar by some neighbors.</p> \n<p>The UAE delegation to the Riyadh summit will be headed by Prime Minister and Vice-President Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also ruler of Dubai.</p> \n<p>The GCC -- set up in 1980 as a bulwark against larger neighbors Iran and Iraq -- groups Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar. Kuwait's ties with Riyadh have also been strained over control of shared oilfields.&nbsp;  WASHINGTON URGES UNITY&nbsp;</p> \n<p> Following global outrage over the Oct. 2 murder of Khashoggi at Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate, Washington has increased pressure on Riyadh to end the nearly four-year-old Yemen war that has pushed that country to the brink of famine and to restore ties with Qatar for a united Gulf front against Iran.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>A U.S. State Department official said on Sunday that Washington would continue to support the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen and urged Gulf states to mend fences, including to enable a proposed new Middle East security alliance that would include the Gulf bloc, Egypt, and Jordan.</p> \n<p> &quot;We'd like to see that unity restored, not on our terms, but on terms of the countries that are involved,&quot; Timothy Lenderking, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Arabian Gulf Affairs, told reporters at a security forum in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p> &quot;It's important not only for the GCC to be a strong bulwark against Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula but also to allow us to capitalize on economic linkages that can add development to the region and help the countries bind together.&quot;</p> \n<p> Qatar's exit from OPEC (after 57 years) to focus on gas appeared to be a swipe at the bloc's de facto leader: Saudi Arabia. The move has deepened the sense among diplomats and analysts that any prospect for a near-term resolution to the dispute is unlikely at Sunday's Riyadh summit.</p> \n<p>While the boycotting states have said the row is not a priority for them and that the GCC remains valid, Doha has said the dispute harms regional security by weakening the bloc.</p> \n<p> Relations have also soured between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over oil production at two jointly-run oilfields in the so-called Neutral Zone, after talks in September failed to move the two countries closer to a deal.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>When the first Christian evangelical volunteers descended on the religious West Bank settlement of Har Bracha about 10 years ago, offering to harvest grapes for the local Jewish farmers free of charge, not everyone welcomed them with open arms.</p> \n<p>After all, for generations Jews had been taught that when Christians go out of their way to be nice, it is probably because they are secretly plotting to convert them, and, therefore, it's best to keep a distance.</p> \n<p>Much has changed since then. There are still Jewish settlers not completely comfortable with the idea of Christians living in their midst and working their fields. But they are far less vocal these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hayovel, the U.S. organization that brings them to Har Bracha, is among a growing list of evangelical groups that operate exclusively in the so-called “biblical heartland.” Over the past decade, it has brought more than 1,700 volunteers to the settlements – and only the settlements because, as a matter of principle, its volunteers do not assist farmers within Israel proper.</p> \n<p>Explaining the organization’s special attachment to this disputed piece of land – that most of the international community does not recognize as part of Israel – Hayovel states on its website: “Every country in the world has turned its back on Judea and Samaria, the heartland of Israel, where 80 percent of the Bible was either written or occurred.”</p> \n<p>There were many years when Hayovel operated under the radar, believing that the less Israelis knew what it was up to, the better.</p> \n<p>No longer. These days, the nonprofit is more than happy to host journalists and the curious at its main campus, located on this settlement that overlooks the large Palestinian city of Nablus. Its willingness to be so aboveboard about its activities is evidence of how mainstream such interactions between Christian evangelicals and Jewish settlers have become.</p> \n<p>The ‘real' Israel</p> \n<p>The Heart of Israel (also known as the Binyamin Fund) is another nonprofit benefiting from these ties. Established three years ago, the organization raises hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly for earmarked projects in the settlements, according to its American-born founder, Aaron Katsof.</p> \n<p>Although Katsof says evangelicals do not account for the bulk of the money he raises, they do account for the vast majority of his donors. “You have to realize that while the average Jew gives $1,500, the average Christian gives $50,” he says. “But their share is growing very, very fast.”</p> \n<p>Asked what prompted him to set up this new fundraising organization, Katsof – who lives in the West Bank settlement of Shiloh – responds: “The more evangelicals I met over the years, the more I realized how thirsty they were to connect to the settlements. When they land in Tel Aviv, they often tell me that it isn’t how they imagined Israel. But when they come out here to the settlements, they say this is exactly how they imagined it.</p> \n<p>“They are our biggest, biggest, biggest, biggest allies,” he adds.</p> \n<p>His is not the only organization trying to translate this groundswell of evangelical support for the settler movement into dollars and cents. But estimating the scope of this financial assistance is difficult, as nonprofits and churches registered in the United States are not required to list their sources of funding or to specify where the money is going. In addition, some of this charity takes nonmonetary forms, such as free labor hours (in the case of Hayovel), or free marketing and sales services.</p> \n<p>A 2015 report by Molad, a progressive Israeli think tank, tried to estimate the amount of money being invested in the settlements by the evangelical community. It concluded that it was virtually impossible – among other reasons because “many of the Israeli NGOs active in Judea and Samaria do not fully abide by the rules of transparency and do not report to the NGO Registrar, in violation of the law.”</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the report concluded that a “hefty share” of all evangelical investment in Israel ends up beyond the Green Line (Israel’s pre-1967 borders), and that the beneficiaries include regional councils, right-wing NGOs, illegal outposts, businesses and travel companies specializing in settlement tours.</p> \n<p>A review of the financial statements of the main organizations active in raising money from evangelicals for the settlement project indicates that the numbers are still relatively small in absolute terms. But they appear to be growing. It also appears that more and more of these initiatives are taking root.</p> \n<p>Often, the best way to determine whether such organizations are directing their fundraising efforts at evangelicals, as opposed to Jews, is to look at the language used in their fundraising pitches (many of which are featured on their websites).&nbsp; When the word “God” is used, as opposed to “Hashem,” the audience is most likely Christian. So, too, if the term “Bible” is preferred over “Torah” and “Biblical Heartland” over “Judea and Samaria.”</p> \n<p>Another giveaway is the use of the phrase “fulfillment of biblical prophecy” when explaining the significance of such donations. It is a phrase widely known to win the hearts and open the pockets of evangelicals.</p> \n<p>Based on this review, as well as on media reports about specific projects, Haaretz estimates the total amount of funding raised in the past 10 years at somewhere between $50 million and $65 million. The calculation (click here for full details) takes into account all the major nonprofits that direct their fundraising efforts at the evangelical community and enjoy 501c status in the United States.</p> \n<p>Biblical roots</p> \n<p>Some 400,000 Jews live in West Bank settlements, accounting for about 6 percent of the total Jewish population in Israel and the occupied territories. An estimated two-thirds of them are religious.</p> \n<p>Since Orthodox Jews have traditionally been more wary of Christian outreach efforts than their secular counterparts, their strengthening ties with the evangelical community were far from obvious.</p> \n<p>“Conventional wisdom would say that the religious community would be the last to embrace this support,” says Rabbi Tuly Weisz, the publisher of Israel365 – a daily newsletter distributed to 150,000 evangelicals around the world. “But I believe it’s the most logical relationship,&quot; he adds. &quot;These Christians support Israel in general, and Judea and Samaria in particular, because of the biblical foundation – and that is something religious Jews can definitely relate to.”</p> \n<p>It helps, he notes, that evangelicals who backed Donald Trump in the presidential election have since been pressuring him to pursue policies in line with positions embraced by the settler movement. These include moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and enabling new settlement construction in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;“There’s definitely more of a movement within the religious Jewish community to accept friendship from evangelicals for these reasons,” says Weisz.</p> \n<p>Ambassadors for Israel</p> \n<p>Hayovel scored a major coup in its quest to gain acceptance in Israel several months ago: The Strategic Affairs Ministry informed its founders that, starting this year, they will receive a set annual fee from the Israeli government. This is not for their work in the fields of Samaria, but their advocacy work on behalf of Israel and the settlement movement in their communities abroad.</p> \n<p>“The government realizes that the hundreds of volunteers we bring here each year can serve as speakers and ambassadors for Israel abroad,” says Caleb Waller, the 27-year-old son of Hayovel founder Tommy Waller.</p> \n<p>For now, the government has offered Hayovel a small sum of $16,000 a year, but has indicated that this figure will grow, according to Caleb Waller. Asked how he and his fellow Christian volunteers feel about accepting money from Israeli taxpayers, he responds: “Well, the Israeli government gives money to the LGBT community of Tel Aviv as well, so there’s no reason I should feel bad.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, it often seems there is more that unites the Christian right and Jewish right these days than divides them. Tomer Persico, the Shalom Hartman Institute Bay Area scholar in residence, notes that many settler rabbis have been able to overcome their instinctive resistance to Christian outreach efforts because the evangelical community has been so helpful in promoting their agenda – and not only on the political front.</p> \n<p>“Not all the settler rabbis – but definitely most – have embraced this new cooperation and friendship, which is based not only on the mutual agenda of resistance to any Jewish withdrawal from Judea and Samaria, but also, importantly, on a shared conservative worldview as far as gender relations, LGBT rights, minority rights, the place of religion in the public sphere and nationalism is concerned,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Religious social conservatives on both sides have found support in each other and a shared language,” Persico, who is also&nbsp;currently a visiting professor at the Berkeley Institute for Jewish Law and Israel Studies, adds. “In fact, so much so that religious-Zionist Israelis today sound a lot like evangelical Republicans.”</p> \n<p>Aaron Lipkin, who serves as spokesman for the settlement of Ofra, notes that many of the Orthodox rabbis known to be opposed to Christian outreach efforts have toned down their rhetoric, noting, “They’re much more quiet these days.”</p> \n<p>And since the election of Trump, he adds, attitudes are changing at the grassroots level as well. “Until Trump came along, it was mainly Anglo-Saxons living out here who connected with evangelicals,” says Lipkin. “Now, there is a sense of gratitude among other residents as well. They see that the evangelicals are very good friends to us.”</p> \n<p>Lipkin owns and runs a travel agency that specializes in evangelical tours to the settlements. It’s a niche, he says, that has proven very lucrative.</p> \n<p>“This is a population that is really into the Bible,” he says, “and 99 percent of the events in the Bible took place in this area – in Hebron, Shiloh, Shechem [Nablus] and Jerusalem. Regretfully, 99 percent of the tourists who come to this country don’t go to where the Bible took place. I’ve made it my job to change that.”</p> \n<p>Less resistance</p> \n<p>Christian Friends of Israeli Communities raises about $1 million a year for settlement projects, with almost all of the donations coming from evangelicals. Established in 1995, CFOIC was the first Christian charity of its kind to focus exclusively on the settlements.</p> \n<p>It is probably no coincidence that the driving force behind this enterprise is an American – a former Clevelander, to be exact – who lives in the settlement of Karnei Shomron. Neither is the timing of its establishment a coincidence. As Sondra Baras, the founder and Israel director notes, the idea took root around the time the Israeli government had begun to concede sovereignty over sections of the West Bank – she prefers to call them Judea and Samaria – as part of the Oslo Accords. Her evangelical friends were so outraged by these territorial concessions that Baras, an Orthodox Jew, proposed setting up an organization that invested exclusively in the settlements.</p> \n<p>Among religious Jews in the settlements, Baras says she detects far less resistance to the type of work she does these days. “Initially, there were vicious attacks against me – but all attempts to boycott me failed,” she says. “Our organization hasn’t had problems with rabbis in a number of years.”</p> \n<p>Katsof, whose Heart of Israel fundraising initiative is modeled on Baras', says he has noticed a similar trend. “People used to be more scared, but I see the religious Zionist community getting more open to this,” he says. “They realize that at the end of the day the missionizing activities they were so concerned about simply don’t happen.”</p> \n<p>‘World's biggest scam’</p> \n<p>Among Orthodox Zionist rabbis, one of the most outspoken critics of this budding relationship is Rabbi Shlomo Aviner – the spiritual leader of the settlement of Beit El.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a manifesto published almost two years ago, Aviner described Christians who love Israel as “the world’s biggest scam.” He wrote that all forms of Christian aid to Israel aim to erase Israel “in one way or another,” and warned that Orthodox Jews should not be lured by “statements of love, hugs and kisses.”</p> \n<p>Evangelicals are the most dangerous of all Christian groups, he wrote, because they see Israel as a stepping stone to the Second Coming and believe that at the end of days, after most of the Jews have been killed, those remaining will convert to Christianity. “This is why they shower us with love and money,” he stated.</p> \n<p>But it seems Aviner is increasingly finding himself in the minority. A key factor working against Aviner and others like him is a landmark ruling by Har Bracha’s spiritual leader, Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, who is a respected religious authority in the Zionist Orthodox community. Melamed had been asked to weigh in on the case of Hayovel, and after considerable deliberation concluded that it was fine for Christians to work the fields of Jewish farmers, so long as they did not engage in missionary activities.</p> \n<p>This ruling was seen as a green light for settlers to welcome evangelicals into their midst and accept whatever help these Christians wished to extend.</p> \n<p>Persico explains why evangelicals are such avid supporters of Israeli settlers and Jewish claims to the entire West Bank. For these groups, he says, “it is essential that Israel control Jerusalem and the entire Promised Land, in order to set in motion the events of the much anticipated Armageddon. The settlers, of course, do not believe this narrative, but they are happy to take advantage of evangelical beliefs in it.”</p> \n<p>Dr. Sara Yael Hirschhorn, a professor of Israel Studies at Northwestern University and a leading authority on Americans in the settler movement, notes that it is these Americans who have been “at the forefront of the rapprochement between Jews and evangelicals.”</p> \n<p>She cites Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founder of the settlement of Efrat, as a leading example. A former New Yorker, Riskin established the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation, and is active in Christians United for Israel – an organization founded by popular U.S. televangelist and megachurch Pastor John Hagee – which has more than 4 million members.</p> \n<p>The favored settlement</p> \n<p>JH Israel, headquartered in Alabama, focuses its fundraising efforts almost exclusively on Ariel, one of the largest settlements in the West Bank. Heather and Bruce Johnston, who founded the organization, had been close friends of Ron Nachman, the late mayor of Ariel and among the first settler leaders to identify the potential in evangelical philanthropy.</p> \n<p>Ariel is largely secular, unlike many other West Bank settlements, so there was also less resistance to overcome there.</p> \n<p>Over the past 10 years, JH Israel has more than quadrupled the amount of funding it raises for Ariel, and in the most recent fiscal year that sum has hovered at around $1 million. &nbsp;Over the years, the Johnstons have hosted dozens of schoolchildren from Ariel at a Christian retreat they run in northern California. It was during one such visit, about 10 years ago, that the idea was floated to create a similar facility in Ariel.</p> \n<p>The $2 million outdoor experiential facility they built in Ariel – known as the National Leadership Center – hosts thousands of Israeli high school students every year. As Haaretz revealed several months ago, the Israeli Education Ministry decided this year, for the first time, to subsidize the center to the tune of 1 million shekels ($270,000) yearly. Like the funding to Hayovel, it highlights how the Israeli government is using taxpayer money to seemingly strengthen the evangelical-settler alliance.</p> \n<p>Among the settlements, Ariel is by far the largest beneficiary of evangelical charity. In 2008, the John Hagee Ministries invested $8 million in a sports complex in the settlement. (John Hagee Ministries has also donated close to $1 million to Riskin’s Jewish-Christian center in Efrat.) Although Friends of Ariel, the American fundraising arm of the settlement, maintains close ties with evangelical churches, it is not clear how much of its funding comes from Christians.</p> \n<p>Nachman once explained that the reason he courted evangelicals was that Jews did not give him money. “I go to the Christians because the Jewish organizations boycott me,” he told Israeli daily Maariv in 2010. “No [Jewish] community abroad wants to adopt us. Their money they distribute to the criminals at the New Israel Fund,” he added, referring to the U.S.-headquartered organization dedicated to promoting progressive causes in Israel. He has a point: Most of the mainstream Jewish philanthropies put little, if any, money into the settlements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (IFCJ) and Christians United for Israel – two of the best-known evangelical charities devoted to Israel – do provide money to projects in the settlements. But supporting these communities is not their primary mission. The same holds true for the main evangelical organizations headquartered in Israel: Bridges for Peace, the International Christian Embassy and Christian for Israel, for example. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Drones in the settlements</p> \n<p>Far and away the largest organization operating in the field is IFCJ, which raises on average $140 million a year. According to founder Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, only a tiny share of this, about 1 percent, actually goes to the settlements.</p> \n<p>“We now have a whole bunch of requests for drones in the settlements – and we are going to provide them, because that’s the kind of thing we do,” he says. “If there are settlers who are poor and needy, and in need of food and heating, we will also include them. But we don’t try to link churches with settlements,” he adds.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Adding up all the money raised by such charities does not tell the entire story, however.</p> \n<p>Blessed Buy Israel, for instance, does not hand out funds, but instead helps promote settlement business in the United States. Founded and run by Steve and Doris Wearp, an evangelical couple from eastern Texas, Blessed Buy Israel sells products made by about a dozen family-run businesses in the settlements directly to churches (as well as online).</p> \n<p>Sales totaled $50,000 in 2017, the first year of operation, and are expected to double this year. Without the Wearps peddling their merchandise, these businesses might not have such access to the U.S. market. The Wearps and their five boys also volunteer six to seven weeks every year with Hayovel.</p> \n<p>“It’s funny, but in many ways I feel closer to many Orthodox Jews here than I do to many Christians in the United States and around the world,” notes Steve. “There’s more common vision, more common purpose and deeper spiritual ties to our friends here.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During the harvest season that just ended, Hayovel says its 175 volunteers picked 340 tons of grapes in the settlements, putting in a combined total of 4,930 hours. Given the current minimum wage, they saved local farmers about $40,000 in expenses over the three-month period. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hymns in the vineyard</p> \n<p>On Haaretz's visit to Har Bracha, volunteers from the United States, Sweden, Norway, Hong Kong, Austria and New Zealand could be heard singing Christian hymns as they picked grapes in the vineyards owned by Tura Winery. Some of the women had babies strapped to their backs as they moved up and down the rows. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Asked whether the farmers have offered to share their profits with the volunteers, Hayovel's designated spokesman, Luke Hilton, responds: “These farmers aren’t rich guys. Every dollar we can save them, they can put back into this land – and we want to allow them to be on this land.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tura Winery is owned by Nir Lavie, who was born in Israel but spent part of his childhood in the United States, while his father served as an overseas emissary. Those years in the United States, he says, taught him there was nothing to fear about Christians. When he opened the winery 20 years ago, it produced 3,000 bottles the first year. Since Hayovel volunteers began lending a hand, production has expanded dramatically and he now produces 50,000 bottles a year.</p> \n<p>To hear it from Lavie, there is no reason to take pity on him or his business.</p> \n<p>Asked if the winery was profitable, he responds: “Baruch Hashem” (“Thank God”). He becomes more defensive, though, when asked how much money he saves from all the free help. “And what about the kibbutzim?” he responds angrily. “They didn’t save money with all their volunteers from Holland and Sweden?”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He has a point, of course, except that volunteers on kibbutzim traditionally received room and board in exchange for their work. Hayovel volunteers do not; they are required to cover all their expenses on their own.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“In any event,” continues Lavie, “what’s really important is that these people eventually become goodwill ambassadors for Israel around the world. And they also benefit because doing this work makes them happy. So let’s just say each of us needs the other. Thank God we have them, and I hope it continues another 200 to 300 years.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>For the first time, prosecutors have tied U.S. President Donald Trump to a federal crime, accusing him of directing illegal hush-money payments to women during his presidential campaign in 2016.</p> \n<p>The Justice Department stopped short of accusing Trump of directly committing a crime. Instead, they said in a court filing Friday night that Trump told his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make illegal payments to buy the silence of two women — porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal — who claimed to have had affairs with Trump and threatened his White House bid. Trump has denied having an affair.</p> \n<p>Cohen has pleaded guilty to several charges, including campaign finance violations, and is awaiting sentencing.</p> \n<p>Although Trump hasn’t been charged with any crimes, the question of whether a president can even be prosecuted while in office is a matter of legal dispute.</p> \n<p>A look at that long-running legal ambiguity and a few of the main issues at play:</p> \n<p>DID THE PRESIDENT COMMIT A CRIME?</p> \n<p>That isn’t completely clear. But federal prosecutors didn’t accuse Trump in Friday night’s court filing of violating the law.</p> \n<p>However, there was no ambiguity in the court documents that prosecutors believe Cohen’s actions were criminal and Trump was directly involved. Prosecutors charged that Cohen arranged the secret payments at the height of the 2016 campaign “in coordination with and at the direction of” Trump. They also alleged Cohen made the payment in order to fend off potential damage to Trump’s presidential bid.</p> \n<p>Federal law requires that any payments that are made “for the purpose of influencing” an election must be reported in campaign finance disclosures.</p> \n<p>“There is a plausible case against the president,” said Rick Hasen, a professor who specializes in election and campaign finance law at the University of California at Irvine.</p> \n<p>In order to bring charges, prosecutors would have to prove Trump had criminal intent and “willfully violated the law,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. Something that would be perfectly legal to do as a businessman could take on a different standard as a candidate and campaign finance laws are “very open-ended,” he said.</p> \n<p>Hasen said Trump’s lawyers could argue Trump didn’t have willfulness to break the law if the payments were completely personal and not connected to the campaign, despite their timing. Some legal experts have also argued that hush-money payments to keep people silent about their affairs are inherently personal, though Hasen said he didn’t agree with that argument.</p> \n<p>CAN A SITTING PRESIDENT BE INDICTED?</p> \n<p>Legal experts are divided on that question. The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the president can be indicted or whether the president can be subpoenaed for testimony.</p> \n<p>The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice and guidance to executive branch agencies, has maintained that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Two Justice Department reports, one in 1973 and one in 2000, came to the same conclusion.</p> \n<p>Those reports essentially concluded that the president’s responsibilities are so important that an indictment would pose too many risks for the government to function properly.</p> \n<p>Trump’s lawyers have said that special counsel Robert Mueller plans to adhere to that guidance, though Mueller’s office has never independently confirmed that. Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has also said that a president cannot be indicted.</p> \n<p>COULD TRUMP BE INDICTED ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE?</p> \n<p>There would presumably be no bar against charging a president after he leaves the White House.</p> \n<p>Legal scholars have said that based on the Justice Department’s guidance, it would appear that Trump could be charged for wrongdoing during the campaign or as president once he leaves office, but likely not before that.</p> \n<p>Blackman said the statute of limitations for a campaign finance law violation — like the one Cohen pleaded guilty to — would be five years. The payments to Daniels and McDougal were made in 2016, meaning the statute of limitations would run out in 2021.</p> \n<p>COULD TRUMP PARDON HIMSELF?</p> \n<p>Trump has already shown he’s not afraid to use his pardon power, particularly for those he has viewed as unfair victims of partisanship. He’s pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who was convicted of criminal contempt for disobeying a judge’s order, and I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a Bush administration official convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in a leak case.</p> \n<p>Courts have never had to answer the question of whether the president can pardon himself. In June, Giuliani told NBC’s “Meet the Pres” that while Trump “probably does” have the power, “pardoning himself would be unthinkable and probably lead to immediate impeachment.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery has sought to block an Arab city councillor from being named as a deputy mayor of Haifa, on the grounds of his alleged support in the past for Hamas.</p> \n<p>The appointment of Raja Zaatry of Hadash, a pro-Communist party, has angered residents of the mixed Jewish-Arab city, and Dery said on Friday he was looking into whether he can block the appointment, claiming that Zaatry&nbsp;supports terrorist organizations.</p> \n<p>“Raja Zaatry, a member of the Haifa city council, has expressed support for Hezbollah and Hamas, has supported boycotts of Israel and action against Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Such a person cannot be named as a deputy mayor as Haifa’s mayor seeks to do,” Dery tweeted.</p> \n<p>Dery has asked his legal adviser about the issue. Zaatry&nbsp;was elected in October’s local elections as a member of the Haifa Front, a party linked to Hadash. According to the coalition agreement he is to serve as a deputy mayor during the second half of the new mayor’s term.</p> \n<p>The protests against his appointment began on a Haifa residents’ Facebook page; another page has been opened on the same issue at the initiative of the right-wing group Im Tirtzu. Right-wing lawmakers have also spoken out against his appointment. Likud MK Yoav Kish asked Dery to intervene, writing to him that “in recent days details of his (Zaatry's) support for the terrorist organization Hamas have been published... Today there is no possibility under the law to prevent a mayor from naming such a person as deputy mayor but the minister should have the authority to do so.”</p> \n<p>Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid has also come out against Zaatry's appointment. He called on the Zionist Union, the party to which Haifa’s new mayor Einat Kalish Rotem belongs, to call on her to cancel the agreement “that links them to the worst of Israel’s haters.”</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;has made a number of controversial remarks in the past. In 2015 as Joint List campaign leader he said Hamas is not a terrorist organization and that ISIS draws inspiration from Zionism. “Where did they learn these crimes from? Look at what the Zionist movement did in 1948 – rape, plunder, and murder.” He has also expressed support in the past for Syria’s President Bashar Assad and for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p> \n<p>Zaatry told Haaretz that Likud and Shas were left out of the city’s coalition and were now competing over which could be more right wing.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“I understand there are people I bother a little. I wasn’t elected just in order to pat anyone on the back, I was elected in order to serve my voters,” he said.</p> \n<p>Zaatry said the city has established two new organizations one that would further Jewish-Arab equality, which he is heading, and an authority for greater coexistence which the mayor will lead.</p> \n<p>The Haifa Municipality and mayor’s offices did not comment. The mayor wrote on her Facebook page several days ago that “when I signed an agreement with Degel HaTorah before the elections, secular voters accused me of seeking to turn Haifa into Bnei Brak. When I signed an agreement with Yisrael Beitenu, I was cautioned by the left that Haifa would lose its image as a moderate city and thus be harmed. Today we have signed an agreement with the Hadash party,” she said, adding that “the Arab public is an important part of our city.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s pick to be America’s ambassador at the United Nations is likely to face questions about her thin diplomatic resume during an upcoming Senate confirmation hearing that will shine fresh attention on the president’s “America first” approach to foreign policy.</p> \n<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Heather Nauert, a 48-year-old former &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; host, will replace Nikki Haley. Nauert had little foreign policy experience before taking the podium as spokeswoman for the State Department.</p> \n<p>Nauert’s confirmation could hinge on her performance at the hearing. Still, she stands a good chance of approval because after the new Congress begins in January, Republicans will have a 53-47 vote majority over Democrats in the Senate.</p> \n<p>In announcing his decision on Friday, Trump said Nauert was “very talented, very smart, very quick.” He said he thought she would be “respected by all.”</p> \n<p>Others, including former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, criticized the choice. Nauert’s job as spokeswoman at State is “to read talking points and explain policy,” McFaul tweeted. The job of U.N. ambassador is very different, he said, and usually requires foreign policy or diplomatic expertise or both.</p> \n<p>Trump backer Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., issued a statement praising Nauert, but his Republican colleagues who sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee were silent.</p> \n<p>“I’ve known Heather for many years. She is a fine and capable person,” Graham said, adding that she had the confidence of Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p> \n<p>If she gets the job, Nauert would take the post with less clout than Haley, a former South Carolina governor who announced in October that she would step down at the end of this year.</p> \n<p>Trump is downgrading the ambassador’s position to a sub-Cabinet-level post. That means Nauert could be overshadowed by Pompeo or Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, who had the U.N. job in 2005 and 2006. She also would be going up against foreign counterparts like the U.N. representatives from Russia and China, who each have decades of experience in diplomacy.</p> \n<p>Nauert thanked Trump and said she was humbled at being chosen. “If confirmed, I look forward to continuing the outstanding job Ambassador Haley has done representing your administration and the American people.”</p> \n<p>Trump’s announcement comes just a day after the U.S. lost a high-profile vote in the U.N. General Assembly for a resolution condemning the Palestinian militant group Hamas. Haley had lobbied hard to get the resolution passed, but couldn’t garner the two-thirds majority needed.</p> \n<p>Haley herself arrived at the United Nations with little foreign policy experience beyond promoting international investments in South Carolina. However, she quickly learned key issues and how the U.N. operates.</p> \n<p>Because of her work at the State Department, Nauert would have the advantage of already knowing the Trump administration’s position on all major global issues. But without being a member of the Cabinet, she wouldn’t have the same independence that Haley has enjoyed.</p> \n<p>Pompeo tweeted that Nauert has traveled with him since he took the helm of the State Department. “I have great confidence in her. Heather plays a key role in advancing U.S. foreign policy &amp; I look forward to her speedy confirmation.”</p> \n<p>She also would arrive at a time when Trump and members of his foreign policy team have all displayed sometimes open contempt for the United Nations and its affiliated agencies.</p> \n<p>In its first two years, the Trump administration has pulled out of the U.N. scientific, educational and cultural organization UNESCO, the U.N. Human Rights Council and threatened to leave the International Postal Union. It has cut off contributions for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and U.N. population fund. It has also sought to reduce funding for U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p> \n<p>Pompeo, Nauert’s current boss, recently delivered a speech attacking multinational institutions and agreements that many believe have served as pillars of stability in the post-World War II era.</p> \n<p>In that speech in Brussels, Pompeo questioned the value and credibility of organizations like the U.N., the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, saying they are in need of dire change if they are to continue to have U.S. support or membership.</p> \n<p>“Haley lost a degree of autonomy when John Bolton became the national security adviser, because he had strong views about the U.N,” said Stephen Pomper of the Crisis Group, an organization that works to prevent wars.</p> \n<p>“Bringing Nauert aboard in a sub-Cabinet role will diminish the position yet further,” said Pomper, who worked at the National Security Council under former President Barack Obama. “For better or worse, the administration’s U.N. policy is pretty established at this point, and there’s no reason to expect that Nauert will deviate from the ‘America First’ course that Haley, Bolton, and Pompeo have set.”</p> \n<p>Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on a Senate subcommittee that oversees America’s relationship with the U.N., slammed Trump’s nomination of Nauert. He said she lacks experience and that her loyalty to Trump and experience as an anchor on his favorite cable news network are insufficient qualifications.</p> \n<p>Nauert, a native of Rockford, Illinois, also worked at State as the acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.</p> \n<p>As a New York-based anchor and correspondent at the Fox News Channel, Nauert oversaw breaking news, anchored programs, covered global and domestic crises and interviewed senior elected and military officials.</p> \n<p>Nauert, who also was a network correspondent for ABC News, is a graduate of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism and Mount Vernon College in Washington.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jewish Voice for Peace can finally claim a couple of victories for its Deadly Exchange program. The Vermont State Police and the Northampton, Massachusetts Police Department have pulled out of a program in which law enforcement personnel take part in a week-long seminar on terrorism in Israel. Participants hear from Israeli and Palestinian Authority police and learn from their experience in dealing with the problem.</p> \n<p>The program, which is sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League, is more than a decade old and is one of those that have been targeted by JVP as part of its so-called Deadly Exchange campaign. JVP’s argument is that exposing American police officers to the techniques and ideas employed by Israel in its counter-terrorism efforts encourages brutality and mistreatment of minorities back home. The conceit of Deadly Exchange is that such training is both inappropriate for Americans as well as indirectly responsible for outrages like “police murders,” “shoot to kill policies,” “extrajudicial executions” as well as “spying” and “deportation and detention.” The claim here is that Israeli police are a force that is primarily interested in repression and violence and those U.S. personnel that learn from them are more likely to kill Americans.</p> \n<p>The problem with Deadly Exchange is more than a matter of how you think the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be resolved.</p> \n<p>Deadly Exchange is just one more battle in the efforts by the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement to isolate Israel from the rest of the world. While JVP pitched its successful arguments to the Vermont and Northampton departments by questioning what it claimed was a lack of transparency in the ADL program, this is more than just a question of whether Israeli police are good role models. JVP’s assertion is that any seminar with Israeli law enforcement is, by definition, a how-to course for violating human rights.</p> \n<p>This is a natural consequence of intersectional ideology that falsely identifies all Third World struggles, including the Palestinian war on Zionism, with the struggle for civil rights in the United States. But it goes further because it implicates Israel and its American Jewish supporters, who back such exchange programs, in police shootings of African Americans on the streets of U.S. cities or in mistreatment of immigrants on the country’s borders.</p> \n<p>That’s why this particular BDS offensive goes farther than those aimed at hindering the sale of Israeli products, pressuring cultural figures from appearing in Israel or halting contact with academics. Rather than seeking to merely single out the Jewish state for criticism in terms not used against any other nation, JVP’s attacks on the exchanges seek to connect Israel with police violence in the United States or along its borders.</p> \n<p>But in making such arguments, JVP is not only wrong on the facts, it is also essentially proving that BDS isn’t so much a critique of Israeli policies but an attempt to delegitimize Israel and ultimately a justification for anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>As the ADL has pointed out, the exchange program it sponsors is not a form of tactical training. Rather, it gives Americans an idea of the challenges Israel faces and how its police handle extraordinary threats of terror and violence within the constraints a democratic society with an independent judiciary puts on law enforcement. While Israel is no more perfect than any other democracy, it has faced a unique set of circumstances, an ongoing conflict that dates back 70 years involving state-supported terror groups and other organizations bent on killing civilians. Israelis have learned, by trial and error, how to cope with this threat and to do so without inflicting indiscriminate violence or abandoning democracy. The notion that Americans have nothing to learn from this experience or that Israeli police are essentially lawless human rights offenders without the same restraints imposed on them by a democratic society doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.</p> \n<p>You don’t have to be a supporter of the Netanyahu government to understand that BDS is not an attempt to criticize Israeli policies or to express an opinion about how a two-state solution might be implemented. As advocated by explicitly anti-Zionist groups like JVP, its goal is to delegitimize the state of Israel and not merely West Bank settlements. Indeed, JVP states its opposition to Birthright Israel trips by young Jews in terms that make it clear that it believes the “right of return” of the descendants of the 1948 Arab refugees must be recognized before Americans consider visiting the country. That actually aligns it with Hamas and its efforts to eliminate the Jewish state by one means or another rather than with any effort to promote peace.</p> \n<p>Treating Israel as a pariah state is both unjust and counter-productive to peace efforts. But by linking Israel and its supporters to disputes about American law enforcement, JVP is seeking to smear them as being ultimately responsible for the murders of African Americans. As crazy as that sounds, it should be eerily familiar to students of history. Blaming Jews for crimes, especially the murder of innocents, even though they had nothing to do with them, is a classic trope of anti-Semitism. In that sense, even though JVP presents itself as defending Jewish values, its campaign is merely an updated version of medieval blood libels, where Jews became the scapegoats for problems that were not of their making.</p> \n<p>Americans and Israelis have a lot to learn from each other and one may reasonably criticize either nation’s policies. But those who single out the one Jewish state in this manner and subject it to discriminatory boycotts are not promoting peace. To the contrary, this most noxious form of BDS is about demonizing Israelis and makes the connection between BDS and anti-Semitism painfully clear.</p> \n<p>Jonathan S.

        "text":["<p>Decisions last week by two American police departments to withdraw from a training seminar with the Israeli police are fueling debate within Israel and the United States about the merits of the BDS movement – the 2005 Palestinian civil society call to boycott cooperation with official Israeli institutions, even where the activity itself is otherwise innocuous. BDS activists aim to pressure Israel to end the occupation, grant equal rights to Palestinian citizens of Israel and realize the right of return for Palestinian refugees, much as sports boycotts were a tool to pressure South Africa to end Apartheid. Yet thus far, most of the American individuals and institutions canceling their Israel-related activities have done so not as part of a general boycott but rather due to concerns about complicity in specific and serious human rights abuses. That was true for Airbnb’s decision to stop listing properties in unlawful Israeli settlements, and it is true of decisions by the Vermont State Police and Northampton, Massachusetts police department to cancel their planned training in Israel.</p> \n<p>Since 2001, U.S. government agencies, together with nonprofit groups like the Anti-Defamation League, have sponsored police seminars for American police officers to learn from the Israeli experience in dealing with terrorism. A number of American civil society groups oppose the cooperation, expressing concern over the influence of Israeli military style policing tactics on U.S. police officers, at a time when the Movement for Black Lives is highlighting police brutality and unlawful use of lethal force against people of color.</p> \n<p>Of particular concern is the “us against them” approach of the Israeli security forces, many of whom treat Palestinians as security threats while publicly articulating a commitment to protect Israeli Jews, including Israeli residents of West Bank settlements.</p> \n<p>Israel is an occupying power in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and with the exception of periods of active combat in certain locations, international policing standards apply to encounters between security officials and Palestinian demonstrators and suspects. That is true inside Israeli towns and cities, at demonstrations along the Gaza border fence, and inside the West Bank. Of course, police should protect Israelis, but a half century of control over millions of Palestinians creates obligations to protect Palestinians, too.</p> \n<p>Those obligations are unfulfilled. Security forces fail to protect Palestinians from attacks by settlers (indeed, their obligation is to safely remove the settlers from the West Bank). They use lethal force even when not strictly necessary to protect life, and use excessive force against demonstrators, including at nonviolent protests. Just 3 percent of investigations into police complaints filed by Palestinians hurt by Israeli citizens resulted in a conviction.</p> \n<p>The problem begins at the highest level, with public statements by senior police officials encouraging a shoot-to-kill policy against Palestinians suspected of attacking Jews. “Everyone who stabs Jews or harms innocent people – should be killed,” Jerusalem District Police Commander Moshe Edri said, following the fatal shooting in 2015 of a Palestinian child suspected of stabbing two Israeli Jewish youths. Police Minister Gilad Erdan warned that “every attacker who sets out to inflict harm should know that he will not likely survive the attack.” Military officials have a somewhat better record of public instruction, and it was Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot who admonished: “I don’t want a soldier to empty a magazine on a girl holding scissors.”</p> \n<p>Treating Palestinians as potential attackers and Jews as members of a club to be protected extends to inside Israel, including surveillance, racial profiling and excessive use of force as part of a dual law enforcement system that discriminates against Palestinian citizens.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Palestinians – like people of color within the United States – argue that their security needs are ignored. In the first eight months of this year, Israeli security forces and settlers killed 204 Palestinians in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank, including at least 77 non combatants, and wounded more than 21,000, mostly non combatants, according to the UN.&nbsp; Palestinian attackers killed seven Israelis during that time, including four non combatants, and injured 88, including 59 non combatants. The May 2018 attack by police on Palestinian human rights activist Jafar Farah and the January 2017 fatal shooting of Yaakob al-Kiyan in Um al-Khiran are examples of how dangerous it can be to be Palestinian in Israel.</p> \n<p>It is no wonder that American police forces – accused of not doing enough to protect the lives of people of color and especially black men and boys – are questioning the wisdom of adopting Israeli practices that pit police officers belonging to the dominant group against communities from the oppressed minority. That’s not participation in a boycott but rather an attempt to avoid learning from a bad example.</p> \n<p>Sari Bashi is a visiting&nbsp;Robina&nbsp;Foundation human rights fellow and visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – Before a crowd of mostly right-wing Israelis and supporters of the Jewish state at the Israeli-American Council’s annual conference last Sunday, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Democrat of California) was asked her thoughts on the Trump administration’s promise of presenting a peace plan for the Middle East. “One of the principles we hope to see there is a two-state solution,” she said.</p> \n<p>Her words drew boos and cries of “No way!” from a number of people in the crowd, who wanted to express their opposition to this decades-old formula for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>Pelosi responded to the hecklers by stating that their real source of concern shouldn’t be the two-state solution, but an alternative idea that is gaining more and more support among left-wingers in America. “I understand there are disagreements,” she said. “But you need to understand, the extreme left wants a one-state solution.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi’s comments came a week after CNN fired commentator Marc Lamont Hill after his call for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.” While the outrage over Hill’s words focused on this specific phrase – which has long been used by Hamas and other militant Palestinian groups – Hill later explained what he really meant to say (during his speech at the United Nations) was that it was time to move away from the two-state solution and adopt instead the formula of one state where everyone will have equal rights.</p> \n<p>The “one-state” or “binational” solution isn’t a new idea. It has enjoyed support on the fringes of Israeli politics for decades, and was once described by the Palestine Liberation Organization as its main goal – before it moved toward formally supporting a two-state solution in the 1980s. (As long ago as 1969, the PLO passed a resolution saying its objective was “to establish a free and democratic society in Palestine for all Palestinians whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews.”)</p> \n<p>Shifting mood</p> \n<p>For decades, the one-state solution has also been viewed as a marginal idea that doesn’t have much support among Americans – but that seems to be changing. A poll released earlier this week by the University of Maryland showed that more and more Americans are expressing support for this idea.</p> \n<p>One question in the survey asked respondents what their preferred solution to the conflict would be if it became apparent that a two-state solution had become impossible to achieve. Some 64 percent replied that in such a scenario, they would support a single democratic state in which all Israelis and Palestinians are equal citizens.</p> \n<p>The Israeli left has mostly rejected this idea over the past decades, as it would lead to the end of Israel’s existence as a Jewish state. For the same reason, the leading left-wing Jewish groups in the United States have also consistently rejected the “one state” option, and instead pushed for a negotiated two-state solution that would ensure Israel’s standing as a Jewish and Democratic country.</p> \n<p>In recent years, though, the mood has been shifting and, as noted by Pelosi, there is growing support for a one-state solution on the left. That includes at least one new member of Congress, Rep.-elect Rashida Tlaib (Democrat of Michigan), who is of Palestinian descent and is officially supportive of the one-state option. Another new congresswoman, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrat of New York), has expressed openness to the one-state idea but has not officially backed it.</p> \n<p>Dr. Shibley Telhami, who conducted the University of Maryland poll, wrote Wednesday that rising support for a one-state solution is likely a result of despair from the possibility of implementing a two-state solution. “When one considers that many Israelis and Palestinians, as well as many Middle East experts, already believe that a two-state solution is no longer possible, especially given the large expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, it’s not hard to see why more people would be drawn to a one-state solution,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>‘Looking for alternatives’</p> \n<p>Dr. Debra Shushan, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now, tells Haaretz that what is driving up support for a one-state solution among left-wingers in America is “the aggressive, annexationist policies of the current Israeli government and its failure to pursue a two-state solution. This has fostered a growing perception that an independent Palestinian state is moot or impossible, which prompts people to look for alternatives,” she says.</p> \n<p>Shushan strongly prefers a two-state solution, and her organization works to promote that goal. As a result, it has often been attacked by right-wing supporters of Israel in the United States. “Since a two-state solution is the only conflict-ending vision that satisfies the national aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians alike, it is incumbent upon seekers of Israeli-Palestinian peace to confront resolutely the formidable but surmountable obstacles to peace and redouble our efforts to achieve it,” she said.</p> \n<p>Left-wing groups affiliated with the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel are clearly pleased with the shifting dynamic over the one-state solution in the United States.</p> \n<p>Josh Ruebner of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights told Haaretz: “For too long, an unsuccessful yet unending pursuit of a two-state solution has meant that the status quo of inequality continues with millions of Palestinians oppressed by Israeli rule. It is welcoming to see that there are growing numbers of people – from activists to thought leaders to now members of Congress – who are shifting away from telling Israel that the status quo is unsustainable to instead saying the status quo is unacceptable.”</p> \n<p>In the late ’70s, when then-President Jimmy Carter expressed his support for an independent Palestinian state existing next to Israel (Carter used the word “homeland”), he was attacked by many leading Jewish groups in Washington and accused of betraying Israel. Today, though, the mainstream position within the American-Jewish community is to support a two-state solution.</p> \n<p>The leading pro-Israel lobby group in Washington, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, emphasized support for a two-state solution during its annual conference in Washington last March. And in October, the organization shared a webpage explaining its support for a two-state solution.</p> \n<p>Growing opposition</p> \n<p>A number of sources within America’s pro-Israel community have told Haaretz in recent months there is concern over the growing left-wing support for a one-state solution. Some of them acknowledged that this trend is also connected to the growing opposition to a two-state solution on the right, both in Israel and the United States.</p> \n<p>In 2002, President George W. Bush officially endorsed a two-state solution. The Trump administration, after almost two years in office, has thus far refused to do so. Trump has said a number of times that from his point of view, both one state or two states would be a good solution, saying at the UN in September: “Bottom line: If the Israelis and Palestinians want one state, that’s OK with me. If they want two states, that’s OK with me. I’m happy if they’re happy.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In 2009, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, in which he endorsed his own version of a two-state solution. In 2015, though, at the height of that year’s general election campaign, he retracted that speech and promised that a Palestinian state would never materialize as long as he is in office. Netanyahu’s Likud party never officially expressed support for two states and the majority of its Knesset members oppose the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel.</p> \n<p>However, there is also a party in his governing coalition – the right-wing Habayit Hayehudi, led by Naftali Bennett – which is pushing for its own version of a one-state solution, whereby Israel would annex about 60 percent of the West Bank without giving Israeli citizenship to its Palestinian population.</p> \n<p>“There is definitely a sense among people on the left that the two-state solution is currently a meaningless slogan,” said one pro-Israel activist, who asked not to be identified. “The lack of any progress in the peace process is causing people to lose any hope for a future peace deal. As a result, people are thinking of alternatives to the classic ‘two-states’ formula. We have a big challenge on our hands, because the one-state solution basically means Israel will no longer be a Jewish state.”</p> \n<p>This is also a challenge for left-of-center Jewish groups – such as J Street, the Israel Policy Forum, and others – that support a two-state solution. These groups have long grown used to being criticized by the right for opposing settlement expansion and pushing for a two-state solution. These days, though, they are also being criticized from the left for precisely the same positions. J Street, specifically, announced earlier this year it was dropping its endorsement of Tlaib because of her support for a one-state solution.</p> \n<p>Dylan Williams, J Street’s senior vice president for government affairs, tells Haaretz his organization is concerned about support for a one-state solution on both the left and right. He notes that while Tlaib will be the only Democrat in Congress who openly supports the one-state solution, there are dozens of Republicans who have endorsed the Israeli right’s version of a one-state solution, which is basically annexation in the West Bank without providing citizenship and equal rights to the Palestinians.</p> \n<p>Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum tells Haaretz that “one-staters on the left and the right have very different visions of what a single state will look like. But their support for one state is creating joint momentum for a disastrous outcome that is going to leave most Israelis and Palestinians unhappy if it comes about.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The festive decorations adorning Ben-Gurion Boulevard outside the Haifa City Museum stand in contrast to the deep wound at the heart of the new art exhibition within. “1948” is a display of works by 42 artists that deal with Israel’s War of Independence and this mixed Arab-Jewish city.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Every December the city’s German Colony neighborhood decks itself out for the “Holiday of Holidays” celebrations, and December 1, the opening night of the exhibition, the street was full of decorations, lights, Christmas trees, crosses alongside Hanukkah menorahs and Hebrew and Arabic intertwined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Working on the show, says Inbar Dror Lax, the museum’s curator, “I felt like I was handling a hot potato. I didn’t sleep nights.” Dror Lax co-curated “1948” together with Dr. Majd Hamra.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From the bustling street you enter the museum, which is situated in two landmark buildings that share a quiet inner courtyard. The exhibition fills two floors of the second building. On the ground floor, the two curators have prepared a welcome that introduces visitors into the atmosphere of the conflict: On a table lie photos from 1948, some of them by Fred Chesnick, who documented Arab refugees carrying their belongings to the port on April 1, prior to the city’s conquest by the Haganah pre-state army.</p> \n<p>Another image shows the British departing and a third photo depicts a Haganah parade.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If one is confused by the photos, with their scenes of the victorious Jewish side and the occupied Arab side, it is by design. This confusion is sustained throughout the exhibition, which displays works by Palestinian and Jewish artists.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The works are roughly organized by chronology. On the entrance floor, there are works by the generation of artists from the period surrounding the events themselves, whereas on the upper level, there are works by members of the country’s second and third generations. The art is displayed densely, the techniques vary, the formats are both large and small. Some artists have only a single work in the show, but there are also&nbsp; artists with three or pieces. Navigating the who requires concentration.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dror Laks says that she had wanted to deal with the wound that lacerated the city in 1948, from the time she arrived at the museum, eight years ago, but that it took time until the subject came together in an exhibition.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not taking a side</p> \n<p>The works by Jewish artists from and on the subject of the year 1948 depict a familiar, heroic narrative, with predominantly bleak coloration, showing the winning side as also having to mourn. Some of them show soldiers, for example Marcel Janco’s “The Wounded Soldier” painted in 1948, and “Jimmy’s Portrait (the Night after His Fall),” by Menachem Shemi from that same year. Miron Sima’s melancholic “Condolence Visit” from 1950 has dirge-like atmospherics, as do Ruth Schloss’s 1953&nbsp; “Mother and Child” and Naftali Bezem’s 1957 “Mother at Her Son’s Grave.”</p> \n<p>Also on the ground floor but on the other side of the pain and quite different in style is the work of artist Abed Abdi, who was born in 1942 in Haifa’s nearby Wadi Nisnas neighborhood. Abdi’s family fled to Lebanon during the war and returned to the city when he was 10 years old under the family reunification program. His works in the exhibition were produced beginning in 1967.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In an essay accompanying the show (the catalog is still in production), Dr. Housni Alkhateeb Shehada writes that, has written that Abdi was “was one of the first artists to depict the Palestinian tragedy, in graphic works published by the Arabic press of the Israeli Communist Party. Notable are his works accompanying the series of articles by Salman Natur, ‘We Have Not Forgotten.’” Shehada adds that this works are “a kind of historical archive presenting the situation experienced by the ‘interior’ Palestinians since the Nakba,” referring to the Palestinian “catastrophe” of 1948. “They constitute a visual expression of the Palestinians’ transfer, expulsion, destruction of homes, confiscation of lands, displacement, desertion, and death.”</p> \n<p>There is a certain sense that “1948” really constitutes two separate exhibitions that never really converge. Is there genuine scope for the two of them showing together?</p> \n<p>Dror Lax notes that the common denominator for all the artists in the exhibition is their direct or indirect reference to the 1948 war and its results. “It was clear to us,” she says, “that we would start with the ‘1948 generation’ – that’s where it all began. On the entry level, we wanted to show voices of those who were there as adults and as children, whereas on the top floor, those who heard the stories from their parents or grandparents. From our perspective as curators, it is a single exhibition.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They chose not to take sides, she emphasizes. “The attempt is to depict things the way they are and enable all the voices to be heard in the museum space. It’s important to give a platform to many artists and historical materials that are located together on the same platform.”</p> \n<p>Isn’t that too complicated a task? </p> \n<p>Dror Laks agrees that indeed it is. “It’s for this reason that this exhibition is so painful. However I touch that year, 1948, I will touch someone’s pain. There are facts, but everyone interprets them in a different way. There’s no agreement on anything. Even within the [separate] societies themselves everyone interprets them differently. There are Jews who think this way and there are Arabs who think another way. Haifa is the most interesting case study there is, because, from the historians’ perspective there is an argument over whether [the Arabs] fled or left, or were expelled from the city.”</p> \n<p>Did you worry about the reactions to the exhibition?</p> \n<p>“I didn’t sleep nights. It was clear both to me and to the other curator, Majed Khamra, that we were dancing a very intricate dance and that each of us had to respect the other’s side. You’re constantly afraid that people aren’t going to understand this. The situation today in the country is difficult, and people are very sensitive. We aren’t in peace talks and we are angry at the Arabs and they are angry at us. I felt it was like a hot potato, and wondered how I was going to even touch it. There are works in the exhibition that I have a hard time with, that I don’t like, yet nevertheless we have chosen to show them.”</p> \n<p>The nation-state law [passed last summer, which declared that Israel is the “nation-state of the Jewish people] and the “loyalty in culture” bill [still before the Knesset, that would give the Culture Ministry the right to withdraw funding from cultural activities that “contravene the principles of the state”] came up during the work on the exhibition.</p> \n<p>How did you react to them?</p> \n<p>“It was very difficult. At first, people didn’t talk about it. Later on, the artists themselves raised questions: ‘Why are we participating in an exhibition if we are fourth-rate people?’ There were Jewish artists who didn’t want to be shown alongside Arabs, and Arab artists who didn’t want to be shown alongside Jews. There were those who said that they aren’t political artists and that they didn’t want me to interpret their art as political. We always had to take the artists’ feelings into consideration.”</p> \n<p>One person who isn’t happy with the presentation of the two narratives in parallel is Inbar Dror Lax’s curatorial partner, Majed Khamra. He did not want to be interviewed for this article, but in an essay, “Seeing Eye to Eye – Faces of Haifa,” he argues that, “The exhibition creates an illusory space based on an ideal, quantified balance between men and women belonging to different groups in terms of nationality, religion, culture and lifestyle. Thereby, a kind of correspondence emerges between the exhibition’s internal space, with all its contents, and an imaginary external reality that supposedly sustains a variety of shades, opinions, and identities.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamra goes on to call for a multiplicity of voices to make themselves heard in the city, “without fear of provocation or a violation of the so-called status quo. The different voices, made audible, will enhance understanding between the two peoples. A ‘pleasant silencing,’ on the other hand, will only strengthen ignorance, and ignorance kills!” Ben-Gurion with a donkey</p> \n<p>The second floor displays dozens of works, each different from the others, and which it is hard to talk about as a coherent whole. Artist Jafra Abu Zoulouf, who was born in Daliat al-Carmel, shows, among other works, a series of photos of miniature olive trees, their roots exposed. These are decorative trees from the Ikea furniture chain, which she has chosen to display show on a black backdrop to disengage them, as she said, “from any sense of space and time. This is in order to underline my doubts as to the credibility of our – the Arabs’ – struggle with Israel and to emphasize my sense that an act of ‘commercialization’ has been done to this struggle.”</p> \n<p>Actor Lamis Ammar shows two short videos jointly called “Untitled by Law.” In one of them she wanders around in the Berlin Holocaust Memorial and in the other she displays contemporary photographs of Wadi Salib – the most wounded of Haifa’s neighborhoods since 1948, which to this day hasn’t healed and recovered. Ammar’s piece on Wadi Salib is the only significant depiction of this place, which is so representative of 1948.</p> \n<p>According to her, it was while she was wandering around the Berlin memorial that her grandmother’s voice welled up within her, talking about her family’s experience as Nakba refugees in Haifa. “It was distressing, wandering around the memorial to the pain of the Holocaust, which had become a universal pain, and suddenly it went back to being the national pain, my family’s and my own. I went to take pictures in Wadi Salib to look for the ruins of Grandfather’s home. It was my attempt to overcome and rise above the law that prevents me from going back to the house and rebuilding it – and even forbids me from remembering it. I borrowed the Jews’ memorial to remember our catastrophe.” She also noted that she wanted to call the piece “Nakba Steps,” but she was told not to do that [Israeli law enables Israel's Finance Minister to withhold government funding from state-funded bodies which mark the date of Israel's establishment as a day of mourning], and therefore named it “Untitled by Law.”</p> \n<p>Next to Ammar’s work, the curators positioned the work “Evil,” by Eliahou Eric Bokobza, which is based on a well-known Holocaust-era photograph of a soldier executing a woman who holds a baby in her arms. Bokobza transforms the woman, the child and the soldier into universal figures, using bright, pop-epic colors and somewhat childish lines that magnify the absurdity. The placement of this work alongside Ammar’s transforms the traumas the two peoples experienced, and continue to experience, into universal experiences and the evil into a characteristic that exists in every individual.</p> \n<p>Haifa-based artist and designer Ashraf Puachri, a native of the town of Mazra’a near Acre, has three printed holograms on display. One of them is kind of a weathervane made up of reproductions of the iconic photo of David Ben-Gurion standing on his head and in the middle of the weathervane – a tiny donkey. “Ben-Gurion, to my mind, is a symbol of 1948. Israel has become a power but we are stuck,” he said. Puachri’s elements are colorful and shiny and he packs them into an Oriental-style outline presented by way of contemporary graphics. This combination mingles cynicism, pain and humor.</p> \n<p>The word that can’t be said</p> \n<p>Very few of the works depict coexistence per se or – by the same token – depict the conflicts simultaneously on a single canvas.One of the few works that does is by illustrator Ido Back entitled “Haifa.” Back, a native of the city, depicts the city’s urban center – the Turkish market and the lower city with Wadi Salib and Gesher Hagibborim – the Heroes’ Bridge – in the background. The whole space is depicted as a mixture of war and the everyday – rifles, pistols and the improvised War of Independence mortar known as the Davidka, side-by-side with commerce, neighborliness and doves. “I chose to depict an urban area because in my opinion this is the place that makes people encounter others and remain human,” he explained. “Compared to other cities where the commercial areas are split between Arabs and Jews, in Haifa the public spaces are mostly mixed, serving a mixture of different communities, and this mixture requires us to conduct dialogue.”</p> \n<p>Back uses only five colors – white, green, pink, blue-grey and blue. “I’ve used a simple palette in order to flatten the opposing narratives. There aren’t any reds versus whites here or blues versus reds. When you limit the narratives, it’s easier to talk about people rather than agendas. This is also a means to emphasize the composition of the circle that combines war and everyday life.”</p> \n<p>One work that challenges the curators’ aspiration to present the situation in a balanced way is “Buqjah 1,” by Nardeen Srouji of Nazareth and Haifa. “Buqjah” is Arabic for “bundle,” which is a common symbol of the Palestinian refugee plight. The artist does indeed create a bundle, but one made mostly of plaster painted white – like the walls here and in most other museums and galleries. Srouji describes herself as critical of the establishment that tries to whitewash everything, as was done with classical sculptures.&nbsp; “The Israeli institutions give a platform to the Palestinian narrative on condition that it corresponds to the Israeli narrative and speaks in the same language or aesthetic. That is, covered in white and diluted enough for Israeli taste.”</p> \n<p>Srouji says that her criticism “is general and not necessarily about this exhibition. Indeed it also clearly exists both in the theater and in films.” She does, however, have some specific criticism of the current exhibition. “Even at this exhibition, which is showing critical works, they are afraid to use the word ‘Nakba,’ and chose to write ‘1948,’ which is a neutral title. Ultimately this exhibition too is establishment.”</p> \n<p>Working on the show, says Inbar Dror Lax, the museum’s curator, “I felt like I was handling a hot potato. I didn’t sleep nights.”</p> \n<p>Correction (December 16, 2018): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Nakba Law forbids discussion of the Palestinian 'catastrophe' in public institutions. Rather, the&nbsp;law enables Israel's Finance Minister to withhold government funding from state-funded bodies which mark the date of Israel's establishment&nbsp;a day of mourning.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Having a founder who volunteered in the Waffen SS, churned out Nazi propaganda and worked out of buildings confiscated from Jews doesn’t sound like a promising pedigree for a political party in one of the world’s most liberal democracies.</p> \n<p>And yet these highlights are all part of the CV of one of the founding fathers of the Sweden Democrats – the far-right populist party that made a splash in September’s general election and has essentially deadlocked Swedish politics.</p> \n<p>Ever since the party gained 17 percent of the vote, making it nearly impossible for any political force to form a government without it, Sweden and the rest of the world have been scrutinizing the Sweden Democrats over its ties to neo-Nazi groups and fascist ideologies.</p> \n<p>A trio of Swedish journalists and researchers – Johan Ulvenl&ouml;v, Matti Palm and Anders Larsson – had a head start: They have been investigating the life of party co-founder Gustaf Ekstr&ouml;m for years.</p> \n<p>“There has been this debate about why the mainstream parties cannot talk with the Sweden Democrats,” says Palm. “People ask, ‘What do you mean by Nazi roots?’ And this is one of the reasons we wanted to find out more about them. This is one of their Nazi roots, and we followed it as far as we could.”</p> \n<p>In 2017, the researchers published a book about their efforts, set to be published in English next year. The work’s original Swedish title, “Utan &aring;nger,” means “No Remorse” and refers to an interview Ekstr&ouml;m gave to Swedish TV in 1993, two years before his death. In it, he expressed no regrets for his activities during World War II and dismissed the Holocaust as “war propaganda” and “horror stories.”</p> \n<p>While his role as a volunteer in the SS was known, the Swedish journalists have painstakingly reconstructed how close Ekstr&ouml;m was to the genocide he denied until the end of his life.</p> \n<p>Through documents and interviews with people who knew him, they uncovered new details of his wartime past and meticulously traced the fate of the Jewish victims with whom he crossed paths.</p> \n<p>The three journalists were in Israel earlier this month to continue their research, and spoke to Haaretz about their findings.</p> \n<p>Ekstr&ouml;m, the son of a gymnastics teacher, was born in Stockholm in 1907. He became an engineer and worked for a while in the United States, but returned home in the 1930s, where he joined the Swedish Nazi Party.</p> \n<p>In 1941, he left neutral Sweden for Nazi-occupied Norway, where he volunteered to join the Waffen SS – one of around 100-200 Swedes estimated to have done so during the war. In that 1993 interview, he explained he felt pressured by hostility toward Nazis in Sweden and wanted to fight for “justice” and a fascist-dominated Europe.</p> \n<p>After training in the elite military units of the SS, Ekstr&ouml;m was assigned to the organization’s headquarters in Berlin, where he worked as a translator and propagandist.</p> \n<p>We don’t know exactly what documents he produced but, as an example, the researchers note that at this time his office published “Der Untermensch” (“The Subhuman”), an infamous pamphlet based on Nazi racial theories that sought to dehumanize Jews and other perceived enemies of the Third Reich.</p> \n<p>“It’s easy to say that if you are not at the front you had no connection to the Holocaust, but it’s not that simple,” says Ulvenl&ouml;v. “By working on propaganda at this office with the SS, there is no other way to put it: He was a part of the machinery that made the Holocaust possible. Even though he was just a small cog in that machinery, he was devoted to it,” he adds.</p> \n<p>Creepiest detail</p> \n<p>Between the end of 1941 and spring 1942, Ekstr&ouml;m also spent some time on the Finnish sector of the Russian front, sending back propaganda dispatches on the heroic deeds of his SS comrades.</p> \n<p>But it is in Berlin that his path intertwined closely, albeit by chance, with the main victims of the Nazi regime.</p> \n<p>The SS headquarters were spread over several locations in Berlin, and Ulvenl&ouml;v and his colleagues found that Ekstr&ouml;m worked out of a building on L&uuml;tzowstrasse 48/49.</p> \n<p>“One of the creepiest parts of our investigation was when we saw in the old telephone books of Berlin that this was the address of the ‘J&uuml;disches Altersheim’ – a Jewish retirement home,” says Ulvenl&ouml;v.</p> \n<p>Documents show that by early 1941, shortly before Ekstr&ouml;m’s arrival, the SS had confiscated the building and evicted its elderly Jewish residents. “We understood people must have lived there before the SS came,” the researcher says. “What happened to all those people? We decided to find them and write down their story.”</p> \n<p>According to the 1939 census, there were 256 people living in the retirement home. The place was likely overcrowded by then, and housed not only senior citizens and their caregivers, but also families that had been evicted from elsewhere in Berlin or Germany because of Nazi persecutions, the Swedish researchers say.</p> \n<p>When the SS took over the building, they had it renovated at the expense of the Jewish community, repainting the walls and removing stained glass windows decorated with symbols like the Star of David and the Ten Commandments.</p> \n<p>The evicted residents briefly moved to other properties owned by the community, some on the same street as the former retirement home. Starting in late 1941, most of them were deported, along with over 56,000 other Jewish Berliners, to ghettos and concentration camps in the east.</p> \n<p>Ulvenl&ouml;v and his colleagues note how it would have been hard for Ekstr&ouml;m to miss the columns of deportees – some from the very same street where he worked – that the Gestapo marched through the city to Berlin’s Grunewald station, where they boarded the freight trains that would take most of them to their deaths.</p> \n<p>“He may have even met these people in the street, because some of them lived nearby before being deported,” Ulvenl&ouml;v says. “He didn’t see them being taken away? He didn’t hear their screams?”</p> \n<p>In their attempt to identify and trace all 256 residents of the retirement home, the Swedish researchers confirmed that at least 167 perished in the Holocaust, while only 7 are known to have survived. The exact fate of the rest is still unknown.</p> \n<p>As for Ekstr&ouml;m, he continued to work at SS headquarters. By 1942, his office was moved to a former sanatorium, also confiscated from Jewish owners, in the Grunewald neighborhood.</p> \n<p>By the war’s end, Ekstr&ouml;m was living in Nuremberg, studying chemistry, and looking for a way to escape the advancing Allied armies and return to Sweden. In April 1945, with the help of the local Swedish consul, a Nazi sympathizer, Ekstr&ouml;m obtained a seat on one of the so-called White Buses.</p> \n<p>These were part of an effort by the Swedish Red Cross, which rescued thousands of inmates from concentration camps in the final weeks of the war.</p> \n<p>“A new passport was arranged for Ekstr&ouml;m, and he took a place that could have been used by one of the actual prisoners,” notes Larsson.</p> \n<p>Aiding Nazi war criminals?</p> \n<p>Ekstr&ouml;m’s good luck didn’t run out when he returned home. The Swedish secret police was aware of his activities and briefly questioned him. However, they quickly released him, even though he admitted volunteering for the SS.</p> \n<p>Ulvenl&ouml;v notes that as a corporal in the Waffen SS, had he stayed behind in Germany, Ekstr&ouml;m would have likely been arrested by the Allies and would have spent at least a few months in a prisoner-of-war camp.</p> \n<p>Back in Sweden, Ekstr&ouml;m continued to be in touch with former comrades – spending long periods of time in Germany and visiting South America twice. The purpose and exact destination of these two trips are unknown, though the Swedish researchers suspect Ekstr&ouml;m may have been involved in aiding Nazi war criminals who had escaped to South America after the war.</p> \n<p>During the postwar decades, Ekstr&ouml;m – a chemist by profession – was active in setting up or supporting various neo-Nazi organizations in Sweden and what was then West Germany, while also attending rallies of far-right sympathizers and meetings of SS veterans.</p> \n<p>In 1988, he was one of 23 people who attended the founding meeting of the Sweden Democrats, becoming the party’s auditor and remaining part of the leadership until his death in 1995 at age 87.</p> \n<p>“There is no doubt there is a straight line between the very first fascist and Nazi organizations in Sweden and today’s Swedish political situation,” the authors write in “No Remorse,” adding, “Gustaf Ekstr&ouml;m is one of the men who connects everything together.”</p> \n<p>The authors are skeptical about the Sweden Democrats’ frequent pronouncements that it has abandoned its extremist roots and become a national-conservative movement. They claim neo-Nazi activists still have a role in the party and that its senior leaders do not shy away from the rhetoric that was common in the propaganda pamphlets Ekstr&ouml;m would have translated or written for the SS.</p> \n<p>For example, earlier this year, Bj&ouml;rn S&ouml;der, a leading party member and deputy parliamentary speaker, wrote on Facebook that the country’s Jews and Sami people cannot be considered Swedish.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“They still think in biological terms, they think that you are either a Swede or a Jew,” says Palm. “So, when they denounce their past, do they really mean it?”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Here’s how the scare tactics work: Attack tunnels inside our territory are exposed. Great job, excellent work. Important news. We discovered them and we sealed them up. Very good. I’m not belittling the uncovering of the tunnels, not at all. The army did what an army should do. A worthy front page news item – that ought to go down at the bottom next to the report on the National Insurance Institute’s bankruptcy. </p> \n<p>But that’s not how the scare tactic works. The fear factor rises to the main headline, it leads off the news broadcasts, the prime minister freely employs his most authoritative baritone. Words like “determination” and “heroism” flutter about like butterflies in springtime. The television reporters don their combat Uniqlos, military correspondent Roni Daniel’s thick eyebrows merge into a single forbidding line and everyone rejects the notion of any connection between the length of the tunnels and the depth of the investigations involving the prime minister. </p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz </p> \n<p>It’s nice that the operation is going well. Going well? people say to me, are you kidding? It’s a Hanukkah miracle, it’s the few against the many. Yes it is, if one blurs the fact that you’ve got an army of half a million fighting an army of 20,000, but that’s what there is and it must be milked for maximum effect. Okay, so we’ve been able to tamp down the scary kites and balloons, and now we’re going to vanquish the scary tunnels. </p> \n<p>And you folks in Tel Aviv shouldn’t go thinking that you’re immune. Don’t think you can just quietly sip your espresso on Sheinkin or wherever you sip it. The tunnels are on the way to you, everything is still possible. One night, in the middle of your Shabbat meal, a bearded Hezbollah fighter will burst up from below. Don’t be complacent, make sure you check each night before going to sleep, keep your ear to the floor tiles and listen for the sound of dull thuds underneath. This will help you. At least as much as the sealed room helped in the Gulf War. </p> \n<p>But not to worry, you’ll never be left alone with the fear. The fear doesn’t come alone, it’s always part of a pair. It always comes along with salvation. Fear and salvation, salvation and fear, two shows for the price of one. Fear and salvation are the key to control, they are the pyromaniac that lights a fire and immediately rushes to put it out. Sending an undercover cell into Gaza and saving us from Hamas, shooting down a Russian plane and hastening to strengthen ties with Putin that have never been better. </p> \n<p>The trouble begins when there is only fear and no salvation. Forty percent of the region’s only democracy are scared of Arab doctors, 43 percent of the inhabitants of the villa in the jungle are alarmed to hear Arabic spoken in public places (according to a Channel 10 survey). Thirty percent of the population of the high-tech superpower would prefer separate maternity wards for Jewish and Arab women (according to a survey by professors Keshet and Popper-Givon). </p> \n<p>Is this fear? Or hatred? A bit of both. Fear and hatred fuel one another. A low level of education correlates with an increase in support for separation, the survey’s authors wrote. In Afula they’re scared of Arabs and in Haifa they’re not. The Afulans are weak and the Haifans are not; Haifa flourished and Afula was forgotten. Afula ranks 127th in the Central Bureau of Statistics’ socioeconomic index. They’re afraid there of Arab grocers, teachers and construction workers. The weak fear those who are weaker than them. It’s the fear of victim’s revenge, the fear that he’ll do to us what we do to him. </p> \n<p>Fear and hatred cause people to unite. Woe unto him who doesn’t hate and doesn’t fear. Fear also gets to the good folks. Out of 50,000 Afula residents, not a single righteous person stood up to say that he is not like that, that he is not afraid. In Germany, too, fear silenced the ordinary folks. A thousand educational trips to Poland and a million solemn Holocaust Remembrance Days in Israel won’t convince the Afulans that they’re walking down the same path the Germans walked. It doesn’t bother them that they talk about Arabs the way the Germans talked about Jews. And even if they were to be persuaded of a similarity, they’d just say – Okay, so what?</p>",

        "text":["<p>Are there almost no Israelis left with the necessary skills to ease the shortage of high-tech workers? Or did researchers who reached that conclusion make assumptions about the capabilities of minorities?</p> \n<p>The Taub Center for Social Policy Studies released a report this week that makes the case that there aren’t very many Israelis with the high levels of skills required by the tech industry who aren’t already working in it.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The report, “Can the Israeli Start-Up Nation Continue to Grow?,” takes aim at a two-year-old government program that calls for spending 900 million shekels ($240 million) on education and training over six years.</p> \n<p>The plans aims to boost the number of computer science students at the universities, improve government retraining programs (coding boot camps) and provide guidance and job placement for populations in the under-representation in the sector, namely women, Arabs and ultra-Orthodox</p> \n<p>Naomi Krieger-Carmy, who heads the Societal Challenges Division of the Israel Innovation Authority, attacked the study’s conclusions.</p> \n<p>“The statement that emerges from the study is discriminatory and even bigoted against women and minorities, on the grounds that they do not have the necessary skills for high-tech,” Krieger-Carmy said Wednesday, shortly after the report was published.</p> \n<p>“We are stunned that a serious researcher in 2018 would claim such a thing,” she added.</p> \n<p>Taub researcher Gilad Brand bases his conclusions on the overall skill level of the Israeli workforce as measured by the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC). Conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, it measures skill levels in literacy, numeracy and problem-solving among people ages 16 to 65. Fluent English is another criterion.</p> \n<p>Israelis fare poorly among the 27 countries surveyed. The share of Israeli workers whose skills are in the lowest decile stood at about 16% of the adult population. Only about 7% of Israeli workers were ranked in the highest skill level, it found.</p> \n<p>Among Israeli Arabs, skills are the weakest, with half the population ranking in the two lowest deciles. Of Israeli workers ranked in the highest skills quintile, 22% are already working in the high-tech sector, the highest percentage of all the countries surveyed.</p> \n<p>Because the skill levels of Israelis outside the tech sector is so low, the pool of candidates to join the industry is small. Brand estimated that all those aged 25 to 44 in the top third of skills not already working in high-tech amounted to just 4% of the of the working-age population not currently employed in the industry..</p> \n<p>Since more than two thirds of that group already works at high-paying, rewarding jobs, most of them are unlikely to switch careers, Brand concluded.</p> \n<p>If true, his conclusions have disappointing implications for Israel’s high-tech industry. Employers have complained for years about the shortage of skilled workers and the industry has ceased to be an engine of growth for the wider economy. Only about 8% of Israelis work in tech, a figure that has not increased in years.</p> \n<p>If the government’s program failed to expand the labor pool, the industry’s potential will be severely constrained.</p> \n<p>“There is little potential for growth in high tech employment in Israel, at least in the short term,” the report concluded. “The study also raises the question of how worthwhile it is to invest in the high tech industry.”</p> \n<p>In defense of the government’s program, Krieger-Carmy said many groups in society were severely underrepresented in high-tech, and not because they lacked the basic skills. She noted that women account for only a quarter of tech workers. Israeli Arabs account for 18% of students in higher education but only 3% of the country’s high-tech workforce.</p> \n<p>She said the tech labor shortage was due to the fact colleges and universities failed to increase the numbers of graduates with engineering and computer science degrees.</p> \n<p>A Taub spokesman denied the accusation of racism, pointing out that the report cited improvement in Arab and Haredi skills. “As for women, there is no doubt that their high skills are exploited in other fields, but the question is why is this not reflected in high-tech,” the center said.</p> \n<p>It said high-tech’s culture, not lack of skills, that was deterred women from working in the sector.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Income inequality in Israel is at its lowest level in 20 years, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Central Bureau of Statistics. Nevertheless, inequality here remains among the worst in the developed world.</p> \n<p>The CBS said that Israel’s Gini coefficient, a widely used measure of income inequality, had fallen to 0.351 in 2017 from 0.359 the year before. The index measures inequality on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being the most unequal.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The CBS noted that the one-year decline was modest and not statically significant, though the decline that has occurred in the number since 2009, when it was 0.389, is important. Moreover, the Gini index in 2017 was the lowest since the CBS began measuring it in a revised format in 1997.</p> \n<p>Since 2010, the measure of inequality has been in steady decline. Yet it still leaves Israel as one of the most economically unequal countries among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p> \n<p>In the years 2013 through 2015, Israel was the most unequal among developed countries, but since 2016 it has been surpassed by the United States. Among other OECD countries with poor records on inequality are Turkey and Chile, with coefficients of 0.35 to 0.4.</p> \n<p>Israel’s index is far higher than countries like France (0.290) and Finland (0.260).</p> \n<p>The reasons why Israel has seen a decline involve several factors. The government prefers to point to its efforts to coax more Israelis into the workforce, a process that has boosted the labor force participation rate to record levels even as the jobless rate is currently at its lowest in decades.</p> \n<p>As Prof. Avi Simhon, Prime Minister Benjamin Netahyahu’s economic adviser, told TheMarker a year ago: “The time has come to get used to the fact that the Israeli economy is in good shape.”</p> \n<p>Others prefer to point to government intervention, such as the negative income tax, rises in the minimum wage and the restoration of some government allowances in recent years. In any case, much of the job creation in recent years has been at the bottom of the labor market – jobs that pay relatively little and require little skill or training.</p> \n<p>In response, to Simhon’s assertion, the left-leaning Adva Center said in its annual report: “To get used to the fact that the state of the Israeli economy is good means to get used to an economy whose growth is unbalanced, led by a minority and benefitting the minority, which means that a large part of the economy and society in Israel are left behind.”</p> \n<p>Israel’s poverty rate is also declining but remains high relative to other OECD countries. Last year the National Insurance Institute said 18.6% of all Israeli families were below the official poverty line of monthly income of 8,345 shekels ($2,225) for a family of four in 2016. Its 2017 data are due out shortly.</p>",

He was ultimately arrested by the Germans and between 1942 and 1945 was interned at a number of camps – Mechelin, Dora-Mittelbau and Ravensbruck, in addition to Auschwitz.</p> \n<p>At Auschwitz, as he faced the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele, who decided who would be sent to the left, to their immediate deaths, and who would be allowed to live, at least somewhat longer, Klieger saved himself.</p> \n<p>“I had no chance,” KIieger recalled. “It was clear to me from Mengele’s look that he would send me to the left, and that’s what he did, and I automatically turned around, knowing that this was the end. To this day, I can’t explain it, but all of a sudden, I turned around again and went back to [Mengele’s] desk. I delivered a desperate speech in which I stressed that I could still be of benefit by working,” Klieger recounted. “There I was, a naked skeleton of a figure, standing up straight and delivering a speech. It's bizarre.”</p> \n<p>After the war, Klieger helped smuggle Jews into British-ruled Palestine and was even a member of the crew of the S S Exodus, which attempted to bring Holocaust survivors to pre-state Israel in 1947. In 1948, he immigrated to Israel himself and fought in the War of Independence.</p> \n<p>He embarked on his long journalism career immediately after the War of Independence, covering the trials of Nazi war criminals in Belgium, France and Germany. In 1958, he joined the staff of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper and later covered the Nazi war crimes trials in Israel of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 and John Demjanjuk in 1987.</p> \n<p>Klieger lectured frequently around the world about the Holocaust. He used to open his talks with a statement about how he could not explain the Holocaust because it has no explanation.</p> \n<p>In 2005, 60 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, he wrote: “I have visited the site of the Auschwitz extermination camp every year for the past 60 years. Every time, it has been as if everything had just happened. It was like that this time too, when I stood in that accursed place as part of the entourage of the president of the independent, strong and proud State of Israel, which rose from the rubble of Europe.”</p> \n<p>In the introduction to Klieger’s autobiography, his friend Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel wrote that reading Klieger’s autobiography was like diving into the events of the history of the 20th century, painful events at first that were followed by lofty ones.</p> \n<p>Klieger will also be remembered for his involvement with sports. He even engaged in boxing at Auschwitz. For many years, he also worked as a sports reporter and also assumed management roles in the field of basketball.</p> \n<p>Over the years, he received a number of awards and other recognition for his work commemorating the Holocaust. The most important recognition was his designation as a knight of the French Legion of Honor.</p> \n<p>Klieger is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As U.S. President Donald Trump re-imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran last month, hackers scrambled to break into personal emails of American officials tasked with enforcing them, The Associated Press has found — another sign of how deeply cyberespionage is embedded into the fabric of U.S.-Iranian relations.</p> \n<p>The AP drew on data gathered by the London-based cybersecurity group Certfa to track how a hacking group often nicknamed Charming Kitten spent the past month trying to break into the private emails of more than a dozen U.S. Treasury officials. Also on the hackers’ hit list: high-profile defenders, detractors and enforcers of the nuclear deal struck between Washington and Tehran, as well as Arab atomic scientists, Iranian civil society figures and D.C. think tank employees.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump's sanctions against Iran threaten to mar the world order&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>“Presumably, some of this is about figuring out what is going on with sanctions,” said Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who has written about Iranian cyberespionage and was among those targeted.</p> \n<p>Kagan said he was alarmed by the targeting of foreign nuclear experts.</p> \n<p>“This is a little more worrisome than I would have expected,” he said.</p> \n<p>The hit list surfaced after Charming Kitten mistakenly left one of its servers open to the internet last month. Researchers at Certfa found the server and extracted a list of 77 Gmail and Yahoo addresses targeted by the hackers that they handed to the AP for further analysis. Although those addresses likely represent only a fraction of the hackers’ overall effort — and it’s not clear how many of the accounts were successfully compromised — they still provide considerable insight into Tehran’s espionage priorities.</p> \n<p>“The targets are very specific,” Certfa researcher Nariman Gharib said.</p> \n<p>In&nbsp;a report published Thursday, Cerfta tied the hackers to the Iranian government, a judgment drawn in part on operational blunders, including a couple of cases where the hackers appeared to have accidentally revealed that they were operating from computers inside Iran. The assessment was backed by others who have tracked Charming Kitten. Allison Wikoff, a researcher with Atlanta-based Secureworks, recognized some of the digital infrastructure in Certfa’s report and said the hackers’ past operations left little doubt they were government-backed.</p> \n<p>“It’s fairly clear-cut,” she said.</p> \n<p>Calls to Iranian officials were not returned late Wednesday, the beginning of the weekend in the country.</p> \n<p>Iran has previously denied responsibility for hacking operations, but an AP analysis of its targets suggests that Charming Kitten is working in close alignment with the Islamic Republic’s interests. The most striking among them were the nuclear officials — a scientist working on a civilian nuclear project for the Pakistan’s Ministry of Defense, a senior operator at the Research and Training Reactor in the Jordanian city of Ramtha, and a high-ranking researcher at the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria.</p> \n<p>The trio suggested a general interest in nuclear technology and administration. Others on the hit list — such as Guy Roberts, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs — pointed to an eagerness to keep track of officials charged with overseeing America’s nuclear arsenal.</p> \n<p>“This is something I’ve been worried about,” Roberts said when alerted to his presence on the list.</p> \n<p>Still more targets are connected to the Iran deal — a 2015 pact negotiated by former U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration and other world powers that called for Tehran to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. Trump tore up the deal in May over the objections of most of America’s allies and has re-imposed a series of punishing restrictions on Iran since.</p> \n<p>One of Charming Kitten’s targets was Andrew J. Grotto, whose tenure on the U.S. National Security Council straddled the Obama and Trump administrations and who has&nbsp;written about&nbsp;Iran’s nuclear ambitions.</p> \n<p>Jarrett Blanc, the State Department coordinator responsible for the implementation of the nuclear deal under Obama, was also on the list. He said news of his targeting was no shock.</p> \n<p>“I’ve retained contact with Iranian counterparts since leaving government,” he said. “I’d be very surprised if there were not Iranian groups trying to hack into my various email accounts.”</p> \n<p>Like the Russian hackers who have chased&nbsp;after America’s drone, space and submarine secrets&nbsp;, the list indicates that Iranian spies were also interested in the world of U.S. defense companies. One of those targeted is a senior director of “breakthrough technology” at the aerospace arm of Honeywell International Inc., the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate; another is a vice president at Virginia-based Science Applications International Corp., a prominent Pentagon contractor.</p> \n<p>Honeywell said it was aware that one of its employees had their personal account “exposed,” adding that there was no evidence that the company’s network was compromised. SAIC said it found no trace of any hacking attempt against its employee’s account.</p> \n<p>There were Iranian targets too, including media workers, an agronomist and a senior employee of the country’s Department of Environment — a possible sign that Tehran’s&nbsp;crackdown on environmentalists&nbsp;, which began earlier this year, continues apace.</p> \n<p>Hacking has long been a feature of the tense relationship between the United States and Iran, whose militant brand of Shia Islam has challenged American interests in the Middle East since 1979.</p> \n<p>It was against Iran that U.S. and Israeli spies&nbsp;are said to have deployed&nbsp;the pioneering, centrifuge-rattling computer worm dubbed Stuxnet in a bid to sabotage the country’s uranium enrichment capabilities. Iranian hackers in turn are blamed for&nbsp;denial of service assaults on American banks&nbsp;and&nbsp;computer-wrecking cyberattacks&nbsp;in Saudi Arabia, Iran’s regional archrival.</p> \n<p>The Charming Kitten campaign uncovered by Certfa is far less sophisticated, generally relying on a password-stealing technique called phishing. Two November 17 emails provided to the AP by Jim Sisco of Enodo Global Inc., a Virginia-based risk advisory firm that was targeted by Charming Kitten, mimic the look and feel of Gmail security alerts, a technique used by hackers across the globe.</p> \n<p>An analysis of Certfa’s data shows the group targeted at least 13 U.S. Treasury employees’ personal emails, including one belonging to a director at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which fights money laundering and terror financing, and one used by the Iran licensing chief at the Office of Foreign Asset Control, which is in charge of enforcing U.S. sanctions. But a few employees’ LinkedIn profiles referenced back office jobs or routine tax work.</p> \n<p>That suggested “a fairly scattershot attempt,” said Clay Stevenson, a former Treasury official who now consults on sanctions and was himself targeted by Charming Kitten.</p> \n<p>Others’ experience suggests a more professional effort.</p> \n<p>Georgetown University professor and South Asia security expert Christine Fair said she had only recently returned from a conference in Afghanistan attended by Iranian officials and a visit to the Iranian border when she learned she was in the hackers’ sights.</p> \n<p>“The timing is uncanny,” she said.</p> \n<p>Another Charming Kitten target was an intern working for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that has been one of the Iran deal’s fiercest critics. How the intern — whose email isn’t public and whose name appears nowhere on the organization’s website — crossed the hackers’ radar is not clear. The foundation issued a statement calling the revelation “yet another indicator that Iran must be viewed as a nefarious actor in all theatres in which it operates.”</p> \n<p>Kagan, the scholar, said most signs pointed to a serious, state-backed operation.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t look like freelancers,” he said.</p> \n<p>Monika Mathur and Desmond Butler in Washington contributed to this report.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Right-wing members of Austria’s governing coalition are stalling a government plan to offer Austrian citizenship to the descendants of Austrian Holocaust victims, saying it would set a precedent for other foreigners. The opposition plans to introduce a similar bill on Thursday to force the government to address the delay.</p> \n<p>The citizenship move was announced early last month by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. It is unprecedented because it would allow these children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims to hold dual citizenship, although Austrian law doesn’t currently permit this. This could be significant news for Israelis of Austrian origin.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The Austrian embrace: How Kurz's far-right government is wooing Israel to end boycott of Freedom Party</p> \n<p>“What we want to do is to give all children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims the opportunity to become Austrian citizens if they want to,” he said to the newspaper The Jewish Chronicle at the time. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the move.</p> \n<p>But Haaretz has learned that the move has been stymied by some of Kurz’s right-wing coalition partners. A spokesman for Kurz told Haaretz that the initiative is a top priority but that it requires complex legislation that is still in the pipeline.</p> \n<p>Opposition leader Pamela Rendi-Wagner of the Social Democratic Party favors the proposal, saying it is aimed at correcting the injustice committed against former Austrian citizens. She added that December 2018 was an ideal time to pass this legislation.</p> \n<p>“We are coming to the end of an important year of commemoration and this legislative proposal would be an attempt to mitigate the injustice suffered by our former fellow citizens,” Rendi-Wagner said. “Having lived in Israel, I had the chance to personally be in close touch with quite a few Austrian survivors of the Shoah. Their so painful stories deeply touched me, but their unshakable belief in the future strongly impressed me.”</p> \n<p>Kurz’s leading coalition partner is the Freedom Party, which was founded by neo-Nazi activists in the 1950s and since then has come to represent the extreme right-wing of Austria’s political system. It has been involved in countless anti-Semitic incidents that have been documented by the local Jewish community.</p> \n<p>Israel has boycotted the party for many years. When the party’s former leader, Jorg Haider, first joined the government in 2000, Israel recalled its ambassador, reduced the level of diplomatic relations and stopped all contact with the Austrian government for three-and-a-half years. This time, when Kurz included the party, now led by Heinz-Christian Strache, in his coalition, Israel announced that it would boycott the party’s ministers and maintain “only professional working relations” with their ministries.</p> \n<p>Since then, Austria has tried to soften the Israeli boycott in various ways. Since being elected last year, Kurz has met with Netanyahu three times and has promised to fight anti-Semitism and change his country’s voting pattern on Israeli issues in the United Nations. But the Austrian Jewish community continues to document anti-Semitic incidents involving the Freedom Party. Now it seems that the Freedom Party is trying to stymie Kurz’s plan to extend citizenship to Holocaust survivors’ descendents, which was seen as another move by Austria to improve its relations with Israel.</p> \n<p>Haaretz reported last month that in October, Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen asked President Reuven Rivlin to consider normalizing relations with the Freedom Party, or at least with Austria’s foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, who represents the Freedom Party in the government but is not a party member. Kneissl compared Zionism and Nazism in a book she wrote, and was critical of the Israeli army and Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>While Rivlin refused Van der Bellen’s request, Israeli diplomatic sources say that since Kneissl is not actually a party member and she fills a key position in the countries’ bilateral relations, the attitude toward her may be relaxed as a compromise.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Chajuta As-Gad, 68, lives in Moshav Gan Ner; and Moshe Ben Hur, 85, lives in Merkaz Hever; flying to Zanzibar</p> \n<p>Hello, can I ask what you’ll be doing in Zanzibar?</p> \n<p>Moshe: Taking a family “roots” trip.</p> \n<p>Roots in Zanzibar?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: Yes. My grandfather came from Africa, and even though I never knew him, something in me is always looking for Africa. I am even writing a book of poetry with the title “The Berliner from Africa.”</p> \n<p>Hang on, how did we get to Berlin?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: I was born in Berlin. My mother was Jewish, but my father was of mixed ancestry. He suffered badly in World War II because he was black; the black color was dominant in his genes. I also have some of that color, even though I am only a granddaughter.</p> \n<p>How did an African end up in Berlin back then?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: There’s a story – I have no way of knowing whether it’s true, but it’s what I imagine. It’s known that at one time [African] tribal leaders sent their sons to European universities, so they would be able to communicate with the West. But those people are no longer alive, so it’s impossible to ask them. In general, people from Germany are silent types. Even though, to my good fortune, I am absolutely not a silent type.</p> \n<p>So how did you get to Israel?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: I arrived with Aliyat Hanoar [Youth Immigration]. In fact, I went from Berlin directly to Kibbutz Nir David. But you should ask Moshe, too.</p> \n<p>Moshe, did you grow up in this country?</p> \n<p>Moshe: No. I’ll tell you what happened. My father was from Portugal. We were a family of Marranos, so we couldn’t reveal that we were Jews. I’m talking about 1934, but it wasn’t until later that I was able to figure out the connections between everything. I was called Jose instead of Moshe, and my brother was called Joseph, and we went to a school where the teachers were nuns. There was a civil war at the time, and planes were always flying over the house. The houses were open then, not like today with a closed roof, so their dark shadows used to give me bad dreams. My father was in the war, but he had a brother and three sisters who fled to Morocco, which is quite close.</p> \n<p>Just across the way.</p> \n<p>Moshe: Yes. I remember Dad taking me to Gibraltar and saying, “Look, your aunts and uncle are on the other side.” In the end, we also fled to Morocco, in a boat. We landed at El Jadida, where there was a Portuguese fort on the shore, and do you know who I met there?</p> \n<p>I can’t possibly guess.</p> \n<p>Moshe: Orson Welles. No more and no less.</p> \n<p>What??</p> \n<p>Moshe: Orson Welles. He was shooting “Othello” there. I knew who he was, because I loved the movies. I painted him while he was being made up, because I liked to paint. In school I was in charge of all the posters.</p> \n<p>Did you go to school in Morocco?</p> \n<p>Moshe: I went to an Alliance network [Jewish] school there, and in 1948, when I was a teenager, I saw the Israeli flag in the newsreel that came on before the film, and people standing at attention in honor of the country. So I went to the school and asked the teacher, “What’s that? Where is that?” You have to understand that we thought all along that Israel was a place that didn’t really exist, that it was like paradise, until the teacher showed us where Israel was on the map. That was a real “wow.”</p> \n<p>So you came on a big wave of aliyah?</p> \n<p>Moshe: Not exactly. I had connections with Senegalese who served in the French army in Morocco. I would invite them to Friday evening meals. One time they told me they were going to France on leave, so I snuck onto their ship. Why? Because I am an adventurer and I wanted to get to the Land of Israel. I absolutely had to. I wanted to go to Israel and be with Jews, and I boarded the ship without them knowing.</p> \n<p>What happened when the Senegalese caught you?</p> \n<p>Moshe: I managed okay. I slept on the deck and worked in the kitchen. Only it was hard, because they didn’t drink water on the ship. They drank only pails of wine, and I don’t drink or smoke, and I barely ate – only bread and hardboiled eggs the whole of September. Also because of the kashrut. To go to Israel and not be religious? Then what are you?</p> \n<p>Where did you dock in France?</p> \n<p>Moshe: The ship arrived in Marseille, and I disembarked. I asked people if there were Jews there besides me, and they sent me to some place where there were a great many Jewish immigrants from all over the world, and they asked me if I wanted to go to the Land of Israel. I said yes, so they put me on a ship called Negba, a Zim Lines ship, with a Star of David on it. They gave us food on the Negba, and now it was kosher food. We were on the ship for the whole of Rosh Hashanah, and got to Israel on Yom Kippur, in 1949.</p> \n<p>To your “vine and fig tree”?</p> \n<p>Moshe: Not exactly. We were taken to St. Luke’s [Mandatory British military camp], which had been converted into Sha’ar Ha’aliya [immigrant absorption center], in Haifa. At first I was confused – I wanted Jews and I saw only Arabs around me. “Where are the Jews?” I asked, and they said, “Here.” It turned out that they were olim from Iraq. They simply spoke Arabic, and I didn’t know Arabic, so I thought they’d put me with them by mistake. From there I was sent to Pardes Hannah. I walked [49 kilometers] from Haifa to Pardes Hannah, in the rain. When I got there, I was given a quarter of a loaf of bread and some halvah. I slept in a tent and there was nothing on the bed except the steel [frame]. I wanted a blanket, they told me, “Go and take one”; I wanted a mattress, they told me, “Look for one.” But I didn’t crack. I said, “Moshe you take yourself in hand.”</p> \n<p>And there was only sand and more sand?</p> \n<p>Moshe: I knew how to get along. I went to look for a job in Hadera. There was someone there who did electricity. His name was Hertz. I worked with him, but he didn’t pay me. Instead, he took me to a warehouse where there were clothes that people had sent to Israel, and he told me, “Take whatever you want.” I took shoes and a coat, and I found a dollar in the pocket, so I took the coat for the dollar, even though it was too big. By the way – and Chajuta doesn’t believe me, but in Pardes Hannah, I met her mother.</p> \n<p>You met Chajuta’s mother? You’re putting me on.</p> \n<p>Moshe: No way! There was a water tap in Pardes Hannah where clothes were laundered, a kind of trough, and I would take all my clothes and go there. Chajuta’s mother took them from me and washed them for me. I remember her well.</p> \n<p>Chajuta: He decided that this woman was my mother. I don’t think so. Even though she really was in Pardes Hannah at that time.</p> \n<p>Moshe: From Pardes Hannah I was taken to the Ben Shemen Youth Village, where I went to school. In the end I got to Kibbutz Reshafim, did army service and got married and so on. When my parents finally arrived in Israel, I already had three children.</p> \n<p>Quite a journey.</p> \n<p>Moshe: I also worked in the Transportation Ministry and with Raful [Rafael Eitan, later chief of staff and a cabinet minister], and there are more stories. But now, Chajuta, tell them about the medal.</p> \n<p>Chajuta, tell us about the medal.</p> \n<p>Chajuta: I was an Israeli swimming champion, I represented Israel in competitions abroad, and I won a silver medal in the Maccabiah Games [in Israel]. Afterward I did choreography for modern ballet, I taught in a music studio and mounted big productions for kibbutzim.</p> \n<p>When did you meet Moshe?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: We’ve known each other 30-40 years, more or less.</p> \n<p>Moshe: I was studying film and directed plays in kibbutzim, and she did the dances. We both ended up on Kibbutz Reshafim. We didn’t get a penny for all the things we did, the kibbutz took everything. That’s how it was. I spent 35 years on the kibbutz but didn’t have an established permanent status and I don’t have a pension. Everything I did doesn’t count.</p> \n<p>Chajuta: I taught 30 hours [a week] even though I only had to do 10, and did administrative work. When you find out in retrospect how the kibbutz behaved toward you, it’s hard. And the main thing: I am the mother of four children and I have 12 grandchildren, but today, when I think about the children who grew up in the kibbutz children’s houses… There were incidents, things bordering on the criminal. It weighs heavily on the heart. But sometimes, when you’re involved in the system, you obey and don’t ask questions. When you’re without parents, you learn how to survive and cope. I didn’t think I would leave, but the moment life on kibbutz ran its course for me, I didn’t want to live there. I’m not satisfied with grumbling – if it’s not good for me, I leave. I don’t miss it for one second, which is shocking. You live for years in a place, contribute and do your thing – and nothing. Actually, I felt that the pressure was off me.</p> \n<p>What pressure?</p> \n<p>Chajuta: The social pressure.</p> \n<p>Moshe: I also moved to a moshav [cooperative community].</p> \n<p>But you don’t live on the same moshav.</p> \n<p>Chajuta: We live separately and spend a lot of time together. Each of us has his occupations and private world; we don’t bother each other.</p> \n<p>Sounds like you’ve cracked the system.</p> \n<p>Chajuta: And we travel together. During Sukkot, for example, we were in Austria. But we also love Israel.</p> \n<p>Moshe: Chajuta, we are the history of this whole country.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Dr. Ari Engelberg, from Hadassah Academic College in Jerusalem, why did you choose to study Lehava, whose name is a Hebrew acronym for “flame” and stands for “Prevention of Assimilation in the Holy Land”?</p> \n<p>It started as a project at Tel Aviv University. I was invited to join a research group dealing with mixed marriages of all types – including Filipinos, Arabs. At first I didn’t actually know how I could integrate into the project, because I am, all in all, a conservative, traditional, even religious person.</p> \n<p>What do you mean? Your worldview doesn’t jibe with marriages that are – sorry, but I can’t bring myself to use the word “mixed,” I find it appalling ...</p> \n<p>As I said, I’m religiously traditionalist. Of course, I believe that everyone has the right to do what he chooses and wants, but I didn’t see myself studying precisely those who choose that kind of marriage. The subject didn’t attract me. That is, it doesn’t bother me at the personal level, but it’s also not something I feel I would want to encourage. So I decided to look at people who are the most opposed to that, namely Lehava. It’s not that I’m not critical of them, but I was interested to see what things look like from the inside: what they think, what they feel, what drives them.</p> \n<p>How was the study conducted?</p> \n<p>I analyzed the discourse on Lehava’s Facebook page, in terms of both profiles and responses, but the major tool was what’s known as participant observation. Interviews. Until not long ago, Lehava activists carried out most of their activity in the evenings in Zion Square in Jerusalem. I went there regularly and interviewed them. I also held many conversations with [the organization’s leader] Benzi Gopstein. In fact, the first time I went to Zion Square I introduced myself to him and he spoke to me and was happy to cooperate. He even recommended activists whom it would be worth my while to interview. But when I started to talk to people without his involvement, it suited him less. He prohibited activists from talking to me and told them I was a journalist.</p> \n<p>The Lehava group doesn’t congregate there anymore.</p> \n<p>That’s right. Zion Square underwent a renovation, and afterward they didn’t come back. My sources tell me that it’s because Gopstein is focused now on an internal election in Otzma Yehudit [Jewish Strength – a political party]. They also removed the Facebook pages – his personal one, and the Lehava page from which I took many of the materials I analyzed – or possibly they were removed by others.</p> \n<p>Who and what are the activists in the organization?</p> \n<p>I observed several groups. Most of the activists are teenagers from weak, disadvantaged neighborhoods in Jerusalem. Mizrahim [Jews of Eastern descent]. There are no Ethiopians or Russians in Lehava, for the obvious reason that in both of those communities there were issues related to conversion [to Judaism] and with marriage.</p> \n<p>Who recruits them to Lehava?</p> \n<p>A social worker in Jerusalem whom I spoke to told me that Lehava’s activists visit those neighborhoods, talk to the young people, invite them to all kinds of activities. They describe Lehava to them as having a mission to rescue Jewish girls. He told me that for teens from disadvantaged neighborhoods, who are a little [socially] alienated, some of whom are at risk, the organization actually does offer a direction, gives them meaning. By the way, many of the Lehava activists I spoke with told me that they are also members of La Familia [a far-right fan club of the Beitar Jerusalem soccer team].</p> \n<p>Lovely.</p> \n<p>Another prominent group in Lehava consists of ultra-Orthodox, but from the fringes of Haredi society – mainly the children of newly religious people. Almost all of them are Mizrahim, too. There’s also a small group of formerly religious people.</p> \n<p>In any case, we’re talking about young people with a particular profile.</p> \n<p>Yes. Surprisingly, even though Benzi himself is very connected to the “hilltop youth” [in the West Bank] – his son and daughter are among them – none of them are active in Lehava. Despite his and [Hebron Jewish community activist Baruch] Marzel’s connection to the extreme edge of the religious-Zionist movement, the young people they collect for their organization actually come from other communities. It somewhat recalls [Meir] Kahane’s activity in the 1980s, and his popularity in new-immigrant towns built in the 1950s.</p> \n<p>In any event, it’s clear who Gopstein doesn’t try to recruit.</p> \n<p>From his viewpoint, he makes his appeal to everyone. If you ask him, he’ll say he has contacts in every school.</p> \n<p>Still, he doesn’t get the more well-off kids from the settlement of Efrat, let’s say, but rather collects them from disadvantaged neighborhoods in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>People aren’t really aware that Lehava’s activists are Mizrahi teens from poor neighborhoods in Jerusalem. By the way, in many cases, when I asked why they had joined Lehava, the answer was, “I knew a girl who went out with an Arab.” It’s not pleasant to say this, but statistically, in Jerusalem, working-class Mizrahim meet more Arabs. Let’s say, one of the workers in a supermarket starts up with a checkout girl. That’s less likely to happen to an Ashkenazi girl who’s a university student.</p> \n<p>How is the organization structured? According to their Wikipedia entry, they have 10,000 members.</p> \n<p>Of course they didn’t want to give me numbers, but having got into the subject, I would assume that the real number of activists in the Jerusalem area is only about 200. Lehava has the structure of a youth movement. There are groups of young people who are 15 years old or so, and each of these groups has a leader who’s 17 or 18.</p> \n<p>The organization’s declared goal is “to prevent assimilation in the Holy Land.”</p> \n<p>That’s what the initials stand for. Which is very interesting, because assimilation is actually a secular concept, dating back to the period of the Emancipation in Europe.</p> \n<p>And also because there is no assimilation: There is no demographic threat to the Jews in Israel.</p> \n<p>That’s true. Even if it seems like a minority can only assimilate into a majority, but not the opposite, they insist that it can happen. My impression, by the way, is that they genuinely think that way. One of the boys I spoke to gave me a long speech about the [biblical] Amorites and the Jebusites, and how they are not remembered because they assimilated. By the way, all the young people I spoke to insisted that assimilation is a widespread phenomenon, that they themselves know Jewish girls who date Arabs, and that the Arabs start up with “our girls” – supposedly, in order to do away with the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>Do you think they really perceive it as a threat?</p> \n<p>I interpret it as a reflection of a threat that exists in the essence of the conflict. It’s about the erasure of the other side. You can see it in similar conflicts. In India, say, there’s a parallel phenomenon known as “Love Jihad,” whose members see the marriage of Muslims to Hindus as a threat, as a conspiracy aimed at causing an entire religion to disappear. Of course, there is no demographic threat to the Hindus in India, certainly not from Muslims, but that’s their narrative.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t take a sharp mind to understand what Gopstein thinks of Arabs.</p> \n<p>He hates Arabs, and that’s also true of his activists, of course, and it prompts them to make very big generalizations about Arabs. They genuinely believe, for example, that every Jewish woman who goes out with an Arab man is condemning herself to a life of beatings and abuse. They perceive their role as being to protect these women. The impression I gleaned from conversations with Anat Gopstein, Benzi’s wife, is that from her standpoint that is a definite fact.</p> \n<p>So are they driven by a desire to protect the Jewish religion, or a desire to batter Arabs?</p> \n<p>I don’t think there’s much of a difference, to them. Their hatred of Arabs stems from their perception of them as a threat and as a danger to the Jewish religion. Consider the name of Gopstein’s party – Jewish Strength – with its symbol: a fist. I connect it with Zionism, with Jewish history, with the memory of the injury done to Jews as individuals and as a group, simply because they were Jews. They might not admit it, but I think that’s where it comes from. Furthermore, as someone who grew up in the United States, as a religiously observant Jew, I underwent quite a lot of humiliation. Kahane, who came from the United States, brought the same thing with him.</p> \n<p>One way or the other, marriage between Jews and Arabs isn’t considered a private act. We saw that mix of the private, the public, even the national, in connection with the marriage of Lucy Aharish [an Israeli Arab Muslim television personality who married a Jewish actor].</p> \n<p>Benzi Gopstein, from his point of view, operates according to a religious imperative. The ban he touts against assimilation in the Holy Land is based on a religious justification: the fear of the Arab man who will violate the honor of the Jewish woman and the honor of the Jewish people.</p> \n<p>At one point in your study you write, “I identified a therapeutic narrative in Lehava.” That’s surprising. What do you mean?</p> \n<p>I’m talking about their approach toward the activists, and the truth is that it surprised me, too. They take in young people, some of them at risk, some of them on the street. Anat Gopstein is a kind of mother figure for them. She thinks about how to rehabilitate them, how to save them. I had a conversation with her in which she talked about a girl who uses drugs and told me how she’s caring for her and trying to imbue her with a sense of purpose. A new direction. Lehava group leaders also see themselves as mentors to these boys and girls. One told me he takes members of La Familia – how did he put it? “They shout ‘Death to the Arabs’ for no reason, he said – and he tells them: Work for the salvation of Jewish girls, don’t just shout “Death to the Arabs.” He gives them purpose.</p> \n<p>What are the boundaries of this therapeutic approach? Is the Gopsteins’ home, say, open to Lehava activists? Can they come for Shabbat?</p> \n<p>I think they make a separation between what happens in their home and what happens in the town square. In the square there’s a lot of warmth, a lot of inclusivity, that’s what I saw there. There are hugs, there are pats on the shoulder, and there’s a desire, which I consider authentic, by Anat and Benzi, to help and improve the lot of at-risk youths who are in need of that. I understand that from the outside it looks as though they are exploiting helpless kids, but the truth is more complex. And in this case, comparison is important. When we draw a comparison to fascist or neo-Nazi organizations in Europe, which people automatically associate with Lehava, and when we see studies that were conducted about the emotional element there, we find that there is a great deal of violence within the organizations themselves. There’s no inclusivity. That’s very plain among the neo-Nazis and the skinheads – they don’t express emotions, there’s no mother figure like Anat Gopstein. In Lehava that warm approach toward the activists definitely exists. And by the way, when I began my research, people would ask me if I wasn’t afraid. But I wasn’t. Because I felt comfortable. I felt the human warmth.</p> \n<p>If you were an Arab, you would feel less comfortable.</p> \n<p>Of course. But still, I can tell you about an American colleague of mine who did a study of neo-Nazis. She got threats, and she lived in terrible fear.</p> \n<p>How do they operate? I understand that they collect intelligence about [mixed] couples, but what do they actually do? Do they go to the couple and tell them that Benzi Gopstein doesn’t approve?</p> \n<p>Much of their activity consists of distributing fliers and talking to people. As for actual couples, I heard a few versions. The activists themselves, even when Gopstein wasn’t present, claimed that everything they do is legal. They send a team of a man and a woman. At first they only sent a man, which of course was problematic, so now there are two of them. The woman will try to persuade the girl, and if the girl doesn’t want to hear and throws her out, she leaves.</p> \n<p>And that’s it? They ask nicely, and if it doesn’t happen, they leave?</p> \n<p>Other people told me different things. I can tell you about my Arabic teacher, an Arab who was married to a Jewish woman, who got threatening calls from Lehava.</p> \n<p>What did they say to him?</p> \n<p>He didn’t want to go into details.</p> \n<p>Did you see or hear about violence?</p> \n<p>I think that Benzi Gopstein is a very cautious person.</p> \n<p>He’s cautious because he knows that people are on his tail. He also gets ongoing legal advice, from [right-wing activist] Itamar Ben Gvir. I also have to choose my words carefully.</p> \n<p>So, look, the people who torched the bilingual [Jewish-Arabic] school in Jerusalem described themselves as Lehava activists. Did he give the order? There are reports of violence. From them, of course, I heard nothing about that. I heard it from organizations that are active against them. That caution forces a certain dissonance on Gopstein: On the one hand, he has to be super-cautious, but at the same time he wants to serve the narrative of Jewish Strength. On the one hand, he wants to show activists that he is strong and heroic, but he can’t tell them to beat up people, because it will get him arrested. So he uses all kinds of hints. Like the one about the waiter at the wedding.</p> \n<p>That if there were an Arab waiter he wouldn’t be serving food but looking for a hospital [refering to the fact that Gopstein said at his daughter's wedding if there had been an Arab waiter on hand, he wouldn't be serving food but &quot;would likely be looking for the nearest hospital.&quot;] Delightful. Let’s talk briefly about his attitude toward gays. They’re being targeted by Lehava.</p> \n<p>Homosexuality is perceived as an attack on holiness. If Lehava fights against assimilation in the Holy Land, then Jerusalem is the Holy City, and they, the gays, are bringing their Sodom and Gomorrah into the Holy City.</p> \n<p>That’s what’s behind Lehava’s activity against the city’s Gay Pride Parade.</p> \n<p>Indeed. Surprisingly, though, if their activity is compared to right-wing organizations in Europe, which are homophobic and whose activity against gays is very violent – that wouldn’t go over here. It’s not violent, but their activity against Arabs is. I think that if Gopstein treated gays the way he treats Arabs, his organization would have been shut down long ago.</p> \n<p>But gays are Jews. They have a Jewish soul, which has value. It’s not just some Arab soul.</p> \n<p>You are now describing his viewpoint cynically. That’s true. But look at it from the state’s point of view. The state would not allow Lehava to exist if it directed that violence, in words and deeds, against gays. It would be a type of pinkwashing.</p> \n<p>It’s well known that Israel is forgiving when it comes to the extreme right, in regard to both declarations and actions.</p> \n<p>Gopstein’s attitude toward gays is relatively soft, certainly compared to the approach of the more extreme Orthodox. The assumption is that they are unfortunates, that they need treatment. That sounds bad, but it’s still different from, “They should be killed,” which is something quite a few rabbis believe. This also has to do with the therapeutic aspect. Lehava accommodates homosexuality. Gopstein himself said explicitly that there are gays who are active in Lehava. When he embraced Assi Azar [an Israeli television personality who came out of the closet], he said it on camera.</p> \n<p>There’s no indication about the scale of their activity, apart from a report which they themselves published. Allow me to be skeptical about it.</p> \n<p>I don’t believe they made it all up. I think, for example, that many people contact them. Gopstein himself showed me the WhatsApp messages on his phone.</p> \n<p>How many female Jewish souls have been saved?</p> \n<p>I don’t know. Gopstein will forgive me, but my feeling is that when it comes to these things, the Yad L’Achim [Jewish anti-missionary] organization is more professional.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The senior officer from Central Command who spoke to reporters Thursday morning sounded more perturbed than usual. Although the security forces chalked up two successes Wednesday night in the hunt for the perpetrators of terror attacks in the West Bank, the officer was making an obvious effort to explain the sensitive nature of the situation on the ground.</p> \n<p>For people who have known the officer for years, since his days as an outstanding battalion commander who had many encounters with the enemy during the second intifada, it wasn’t hard to discern a note of concern in his voice.</p> \n<p>At the end of the discussion, without the words being said outright even once, the bottom line was clear: The West Bank is facing another wave of violence. The ability to stop this trend in the coming days, before it spreads, depends mainly on the forces in the field – on whether a wave of copy-cat attacks will translate into another success for terror.</p> \n<p>And the outcome, certainly in a shooting attack, is often a matter of the speed of the response and even a bit of luck. There’s a commander of a regional brigade in the West Bank who often says to his soldiers: “Give me 15 good seconds. We’ll take care of the rest.” In other words, disrupting the attack, or at least harming the attacker immediately, depends on the alertness of the first soldiers at the site.</p> \n<p>The reason for concern became clear less than two hours later: An armed Palestinian opened fire at soldiers and civilians at a hitchhiking stop near the Givat Assaf outpost east of Ramallah. Two soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion (the ultra-Orthodox Nahal unit) were killed. Another soldier and an Israeli woman were seriously wounded. The gunman fled.</p> \n<p>This looks like a direct Palestinian reaction to previous events. On Wednesday evening, north of Ramallah, members of Yamam, a Border Police counterterrorism unit, killed the Hamas member suspected of the shooting attack at the settlement of Ofra this week that killed a newborn baby and wounded six other Israeli civilians.</p> \n<p>Several others involved in the attack were arrested. A few hours later, in the Askar refugee camp outside Nablus, another Yamam force killed the man who murdered two civilians in an attack in the Barkan industrial zone in early October.</p> \n<p>Both of the terrorists who were killed were armed. In both cases, the assessment is that they intended to carry out similar attacks in the near future. The two were nabbed by members of the most highly skilled unit that carries out operations of this kind. We can assume that the country’s political and security leaders didn’t shed tears because what began as an arrest operation ended with killings.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Two Israelis killed, two seriously wounded in west bank shooting | Attempted terror attacks in west bank on the rise, say Israeli security officials</p> \n<p>A few hours later, another shooting attack took place, similar to the one that took place near Ofra on Sunday. The incident may have been an attempt to exact revenge for the killings, but the timing was meaningful too&nbsp;&nbsp;–  a day before the anniversary of Hamas' founding.</p> \n<p>The recent series of incidents is a recipe for escalation because there could be copy-cat attacks that generate a cycle of revenge attacks. The army has decided to reinforce its presence in the West Bank for the second time this week; the idea is that the additional forces will serve as a firewall.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, the army has sealed off Ramallah. The sensitivity is particularly high because the city is the capital of the Palestinian Authority and the place where most of the Palestinian security forces are centered.</p> \n<p>The investigation of Thursday morning's incident has only just begun. And the Shin Bet security service hasn't released extensive details on its investigations into the two terrorist attacks that have been among the most serious recently in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>In recent weeks, there has been an increase in the number of highway shootings in the West Bank. On average in recent months, between four and eight shootings, stabbings or car-ramming attacks have been committed there per month. In at least some of the cases, it appears these attacks reflect a growing hybrid phenomenon that's harder for the security forces to deal with.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During the second intifada, which broke out in late September 2000, the Israeli army and the Shin Bet learned how to deal well with the decently organized terrorist infrastructure of groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The endless string of arrests (and in the peak years of the conflict, sometimes assassinations) created an effect that was dubbed “mowing the lawn” – systematically hitting at this terror infrastructure, which prevented the groups from developing and/or reestablishing their expertise.</p> \n<p>In the autumn of 2015, a different phenomenon hit the West Bank and East Jerusalem on an unprecedented scale: attacks by lone-wolf terrorists. Hundreds of young people, both male and female, acting on their own and without an organizational network behind them, set out to commit attacks with kitchen knives, or in the case of ramming attacks, the steering wheel of the family car.</p> \n<p>But Israel also gradually learned how to act against these methods. Intensive monitoring of social media used by Palestinians, in addition to effective warning talks from the Palestinian Authority's security forces, headed off many of the cases in which young people would have set out on attacks.</p> \n<p>Another phenomenon is a kind of hybrid of the two other categories. It involves local cells, usually without any declared ideological affiliation, that organize based on personal or family acquaintance. Such cells are responsible for some of the recent attacks. In these cases, the acquaintances provide the terrorist with cover, as apparently happened with the gunman in the Barkan industrial zone.</p> \n<p>But the main risk from recent events in the West Bank relates to Hamas’ conduct. A Shin Bet statement at the end of last month about the arrest of a Hebron-area resident who had been trained as an explosives “engineer” attracted little attention in Israel. What was new in the disclosure was how the engineer had been deployed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In recent years, hundreds of attempts by Hamas leaders in Gaza and abroad to carry out attacks in Israel and the West Bank using West Bank cells have been foiled. The hierarchy in these cases has been clear. Saleh al-Arouri, of Hamas' military wing, has led the operations. Arouri currently splits his time between Lebanon and Turkey.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, two entities have worked under Arouri, known as the West Bank headquarters and the West Bank region. Some of their operations have relied on terrorists from the West Bank who were expelled to the Gaza Strip as part of the 2011 prisoner swap for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas hasn't given up on the effort, but it appears to have switched approaches. The engineer who was arrested, Awis Rajoub, was deployed directly by people in the Gaza Strip, without a connection to Arouri and the Shalit deportees.</p> \n<p>The organization appears to be seeking to streamline the command hierarchy and improve its operational results. These efforts are sufficiently important for Hamas to continue to pursue them as it tries to reach a long-term cease-fire agreement with Israel in the Gaza Strip. Gaza and the West Bank are separate matters.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas’ approach remains unchanged. A resumption of lethal terrorist attacks from the West Bank would make things difficult for Israel, impeding security cooperation with the Palestinian Authority’s security services, undermining the stability of President Mahmoud Abbas’ rule, and certainly damaging an orderly transfer of power to Abbas’ successors.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the Gaza Strip, based on Israeli intelligence assessments, Hamas is wary about a war. The continued flow of fuel and funds to pay salaries in Gaza, financed by Qatar, is designed to help maintain relative calm, but the possibility of an escalation in the West Bank could also seep into Gaza.</p> \n<p>But Hamas won't achieve a long-term agreement if it doesn't achieve its goals: a substantial easing of the blockade of the Gaza Strip, considerable improvements to the civilian infrastructure there, and a maintaining of its military power.</p> \n<p>Hamas doesn't view a deal on the return of two Israeli civilians and the body of two Israeli soldiers as an essential part of the process. From its standpoint, that’s a separate question that should be considered in the contacts regarding a long-term cease-fire.</p>",

I’ve seen hundreds of photos that purport to be Paris, but don’t depict Paris.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Hamilton 68 Dashboard, which&nbsp;tracks accounts on Twitter that reliably echo the Kremlin narrative. These hashtags suggest Moscow’s priorities on December 8th, the height of recent protests:</p> \n<p>But of the Twitter hashtags that were really trending in France at the same time, only one&nbsp;concerned the Gilet Jaunes (#8December). The other trending tweets concerned football, save the third-most&nbsp;popular hashtag, about the Climate March. This also took place on December 8. It attracted more people than the Gilet Jaunes protest. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Why is Russia doing this?&nbsp;The aim of Russia’s misinformation is to heighten the contradictions, as Lenin once put it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Kremlin’s news organs urge the Yellow Vests on to ever-more spectacular violence - then portrays them as a maddened horde.</p> \n<p>Sputnik dusts off the Cominform’s greatest hits:&nbsp;The French people &quot;speaking out...at the injustice of capitalism…governments across&nbsp;Europe are wary of&nbsp;a tidal wave of&nbsp;people power [and..] out&nbsp;of desperation to&nbsp;retain their privileges and wealth, go full fascism. The liberal mask of&nbsp;Western democracies appears to&nbsp;be slipping to&nbsp;reveal the brute force beneath.&quot;</p> \n<p>RT is luxuriating in horrific&nbsp;accounts of police brutality,&nbsp;then back comes Sputnik, accusing the Gilet Jaunes of creating an &quot;hyper-favorable playground&quot; for terrorism in the wake of the later attack in Strasbourg. (For this jewel, Sputnik interviewed a superannuated French general once convicted of illegal surveillance.)</p> \n<p>Russia is an imperial kleptocracy running a state-controlled energy empire. It seeks to divide and conquer the West, turn&nbsp;the feuding nations of Europe into subservient vassals, and leave the United States isolated, friendless, and irrelevant.</p> \n<p>The Kremlin and Gazprom (same thing) use a three-part strategy&nbsp;of disaggregation, co-option, and pre-emption.</p> \n<p>Their goal is to discourage the EU from forming a coherent, common energy policy. They seek to disaggregate Europe’s&nbsp;governments by breaking up the EU or making it unworkable, then entice its governments into bilateral deals. They co-opt strong domestic players into joint ventures and&nbsp;turn them into powerful Russian lobbyists: Think of Gazprom hiring former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. They pre-empt the emergence of competing sources of supply, from Libya&nbsp;to Bolivia.&nbsp; , &gt;&gt;&nbsp;How America’s Far Left and Far Right Fell In Love At The Kremlin&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump and Putin Just Ripped Europe Apart. The Consequences Will Be Catastrophic</p> \n<p>Clearly, if a group of French protesters emerges with talking points that sound as if the Kremlin wrote their script (not only are they demanding cheaper fossil fuels, they seek France’s withdrawal from NATO), it’s inevitable that the Kremlin will find this exciting and pleasing - and will try to amplify the protesters’ voices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is all the more so because the Kremlin dislikes Macron, who&nbsp;isn’t as keen to turn France into a Kremlin satrapy as his far-left and far-right rivals: both are prepared to swear their eternal troth to Moscow.</p> \n<p>The Kremlin would much prefer to deal with the far-left M&eacute;lenchon or the far-right Le&nbsp;Pen, and in either case, a much weakened France. One of them could be the beneficiary of this if Macron doesn't survive.</p> \n<p>This is&nbsp;not to say that the Kremlin wrote the Gilets Jaunes' script. The protests and riots are organic and real; they devolve from serious, longstanding discontent in France’s rural periphery, which feels poorly served and squeezed by the state.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is no evidence that Russia conceived of this uprising. Nor is there evidence that it’s dangling the protesters’ puppet-strings. I stress this because the idea has become&nbsp;another&nbsp;lunatic Twitter conspiracy theory, complete with a video of a man speaking Russian, in Paris, and a caption that declares him to be a &quot;known Russian intelligence agent.&quot;</p> \n<p>Russia does not have the ability to conjure up a movement like this&nbsp;ex nihilo. What they have the power to do - and what they&nbsp;do, without a doubt; indeed, you can watch them do it in real time - is scan the horizon for conflicts and divisions in open&nbsp;societies, then try to exacerbate them on social media.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And it works.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you don’t think it has any influence, or if you doubt it could make the difference in a close election closer to your home, watch what they're doing in France. If you have no dog in this fight, and even if you do, watch it dispassionately.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When French people see online videos headlined &quot;French police brutality,&quot; many fall for it, even if the video wasn't shot in France. They retweet it and believe it. These videos outrage and politicize; they engender further distrust among people so saturated in distrust of the authorities that Gilets Jaunes spokesmen are prepared to believe the French secret services staged a deadly terrorist attack in Strasbourg themselves.</p> \n<p>There has indeed been violence. But lurid and exaggerated descriptions serve a useful purpose to propagandists: when, for example, people in the UK see photos of riots and violence on Facebook (no matter their provenance) with the words &quot;Terrifying!!!&quot; and &quot;France is&nbsp;falling apart!&quot; they are much more likely to retweet the next meme: &quot;Thank God for Brexit!!!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One suspects those memes were not created by men and women with a deep and genuine concern for public order in France.</p> \n<p>Russian bots and trolls are working this angle hard. But the Gilet Jaunes themselves are an ample font of misinformed nonsense: The director of Conspiracy Watch, Rudy Reichstadt, lamented that, “like&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald Trump’s constituents, some yellow jackets have a high permeability to conspiracy theories; with no movement spokesperson to clearly distancing them from it.” That’s led to a surge in anti-vaxxer slogans and interest in chemtrails.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Circulating widely - and inevitably, in such a climate - are anti-Semitic theories, memes and videos.</p> \n<p>In an AFP street interview, one Yellow Vest described Macron as a pawn of &quot;Soros, Rothschild and Goldman Sachs.&quot; American neo-Nazis are&nbsp;cuckoo for the Gilets Jaunes, though they might lose their enthusiasm were they to meet them and discover how many in their ranks are dedicated leftist Black Blocs, a cross-European movement that combats fascism with vandalism and throwing projectiles at the police.</p> \n<p>President Trump listens to television broadcasters who read out this misinformation and exaggerations and believes the protests here were sparked by the Paris climate agreement and that people here are chanting his name.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is not merely untrue, but nonsensical: Most of the Gilet Jaunes profess devout concern about climate change. Apocalyptic thinking, and the idea that mankind is a stain on the planetary Garden of Eden fit in perfectly with every other aspect of their&nbsp;worldview.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The uprising had nothing to do with the climate treaty. One of the most ancient of French traditions is&nbsp;hatred of the&nbsp;gabelle: French peasants have been violently objecting to taxation since the mid-14thcentury. What they want - to the extent their demands are coherent - is a tax structure that soaks the rich.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And to a last, they find Trump preposterous. Among their demands is France’s withdrawal from NATO and the end of all French military commitments overseas. Why on earth would they want Trump?</p> \n<p>But Trump managed to plant this idea in people's minds to the point that even journalists who spend their days and weeks debunking Trump tweets half-consciously absorbed it - and began writing serious articles what this uprising means for global climate policy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>That's another key to the way disinformation works: You put out an idea that's complete&nbsp;nonsense. People know it’s nonsense. But somehow they can't get the thought and its associations out of their heads.&nbsp;  This the great irony of the age of the cell phone and the Internet. There are cameras everywhere. Every minute of our life is under surveillance. We can communicate&nbsp;instantly with every participant in this event.</p> \n<p>But the only way to know what’s&nbsp;real&nbsp;is to come on over and look with your own eyes. Epistemologically, we're back in the&nbsp;18th century.&nbsp;Let’s just hope that online agitprop from ill-wishers exacerbating real-life violence don’t force Europe and its allies into a full political and social regression too.</p> \n<p>Claire Berlinski is a freelance writer who lives in Paris.

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – The most worrying thing in America today is neither bigotry nor hatred but the silence around it, Sen. Cory Booker (Democrat of New Jersey) told the Anti-Defamation League’s “Never is Now” anti-Semitism summit on Monday.</p> \n<p>The 2020 presidential hopeful was quoting Rabbi Joachim Prinz, who spoke immediately before his hero, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., at 1963’s March on Washington.</p> \n<p>Before King delivered his historic “I Have a Dream” speech, Prinz spoke about witnessing the devastation faced by Germany’s Jewish community under Nazi rule. He had served as a rabbi in Berlin before escaping to America and settling in Newark, New Jersey – the same city Booker led as mayor for seven years before being elected to the Senate in 2013.</p> \n<p>Civil rights activist Prinz had said he learned in Germany that “bigotry and hatred are not the most urgent problem. The most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence.”</p> \n<p>Booker compared that to anti-Semitism in the United States today. The senator warned that “we’re a nation that can’t allow our highest ideal to be tolerance. … Love says ‘I see you, I see your dignity and worth, that we have a common destiny,’” he said.</p> \n<p>“If you love someone, you cannot be a bystander but must be actively engaged in ensuring human dignity for all people. It’s not enough to say ‘I’m not racist.’ You must be actively anti-racist. You must be actively anti-anti-Semitism,” he said to enthusiastic applause.</p> \n<p>The focus of Monday’s conference, attended by some 1,300 people, was the ways in which expressions of anti-Semitism in America are changing. This includes growing anti-Semitism from the political left and an ironic form of Zionist support from some avowed anti-Semites.</p> \n<p>“Anti-Semitism is becoming normalized,” said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt in his opening remarks. “This past year, we saw a record number of explicit and unapologetic extremists and bigots running on the ballot in campaigns at all levels. And we have seen a shocking surge of anti-Semitism on campus, with most university administrations pathetically slow and fecklessly stumbling in their responses.</p> \n<p>“While anti-Semitic incidents generally had been declining for more than a decade until 2016,” he continued, “last year we saw the largest single-year increase since ADL initiated our annual audit 40 years ago. Regardless of what some might say, this is a plain fact,” he said, alluding to a comment by Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett last month, in which he publicly doubted the validity of the ADL’s report into anti-Semitic incidents in 2017.</p> \n<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook was awarded the ADL’s inaugural Courage Against Hate award at the conference. Apple “was the first company to remove Alex Jones’ hateful anti-government conspiratorial rants from their platforms; other tech companies followed their lead,” said Greenblatt, referring to Jones’ Infowars channel, as he introduced the tech leader.</p> \n<p>Cook himself quoted Leviticus 19:16: “Do not be indifferent to the bloodshed of your fellow man” – first saying the quote in Hebrew (“Lo ta’amod al dam re’eikha”). “It is a teaching found in Judaism, but also in every religion,” Cook said. “Do not be indifferent. This mandate moves us to speak up for immigrants, for those who seek opportunity in the United States. Not just because we value their ingenuity, but because our own humanity commands us to welcome those who need welcome,” he said.</p> \n<p>We need to “not be bystanders as hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world,” Cook continued. “At Apple, we believe technology needs to have a clear point of view. This is no time to get tied up in knots. We only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division or violence: You have no place on our platforms,” he said, to loud applause. “The most sacred thing each of us is given is our judgment. Our morality. Our own innate desire to separate right from wrong. Choosing to set that aside at a moment of trial is a sin.</p> \n<p>“I worry less about computers that think like people and more about people that think like computers – without values or compassion or concern about consequences,” he concluded.</p> \n<p>Bluewashing, the alt-right and 'termites'</p> \n<p>The challenge of addressing anti-Semitism was the focus of most of the day’s sessions.</p> \n<p>New York Times op-ed columnist Bret Stephens, Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt and Forward Editor-in-Chief Jane Eisner were panelists on a discussion about what is driving anti-Semitism in 2018.</p> \n<p>Stephens called the current anti-Semitism “a mutating virus. … Every head of this three-headed monster has now raised its head above the water,” he said, citing hateful online chatter from the alt-right (a term used by white nationalists to describe themselves), religiously motivated Jew-hatred “throughout too much of the Islamic world, I am sorry to say,” and “Jew hatred on the left, which replicates the slander and defamation from traditional Jew haters and applies it to the State of Israel.”</p> \n<p>Lipstadt called out “an irony you hear from the alt-right. I’ve spent a lot of time in their sewers. Some of them love Israel because it is the white ethno-state they want to create in the U.S. I fear there is going to be an anti-Semitic, pro-Zionist view,” she said.</p> \n<p>Stephens quipped that “engaging in anti-Semitism or anti-Semitic-like rhetoric but saying Israel is great” should be called “bluewashing.”</p> \n<p>Throughout the day, speakers talked about the importance of allyship between Jews and other marginalized communities, noting the support from Muslims and Christians that flooded in after the murder of 11 Jewish worshippers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue on October 27.</p> \n<p>For some progressive Zionists, that allyship has been strained of late – especially with Tamika Mallory, a co-leader of the Women’s March movement, continuing to align herself with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who recently called Jews “termites.”</p> \n<p>“What do you do with termites?” asked Lipstadt rhetorically. “You call the exterminator.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the upcoming Women’s March in Washington, Lipstadt’s response was swift: “Don’t go. Yes, politics makes strange bedfellows. But when you call me a termite, I’m not marching,” she said, to applause.</p> \n<p>“The rawness and violence of that massacre [in Pittsburgh] really changed our sense of vulnerability,” said Eisner. “It also taught other people in America that this plague of anti-Semitism is real. There’s a new regard for the situation of Jews that had been missing. We are figuring out a new Jewish vernacular related to, but not dependent on, Israel – responding in a purely Jewish way to what’s happening in America.”</p> \n<p>One session exploring when criticism of Israel becomes anti-Semitism showed the challenges faced drawing a line between legitimate critique and hatred of Jews.</p> \n<p>“Israel deserves criticism like any other country,” said Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of T’ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights, which advocates against the occupation. But “when people see everything Jews do as a symbol of Israel, it crosses the line” into anti-Semitism, she said.</p> \n<p>Jacobs cited a sukkah on the Upper East Side being vandalized with the words “Free Gaza” and “when someone screams out ‘What about Palestine?’ in the context of a rabbi or Jew speaking about something else. It is anti-Semitic to say that Jews are equivalent to Israel, that a Jew has no right to speak about anything else,” she said.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, “There are lots of people in the Jewish community who say that any criticism of Israel is necessarily anti-Semitism,” she continued. “We have to be very, very clear about our lines, because if we cry wolf every time there’s criticism of Israel, nobody will listen when it’s really important.”</p> \n<p>Given the sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the United States – the ADL says new national data indicates hate crimes targeting Jews spiked 37 percent in 2017 – Greenblatt said he worries that outrage may diminish if the pace of assaults continues.</p> \n<p>“I worry about anti-Semitism fatigue,” Greenblatt told Haaretz. “I hope and pray that the number of incidents goes down, and that we won’t see the kind of violence we’ve seen.”</p>",

Since then, efforts to find the tunnels have accelerated; Northern Command officers predict that it will take several weeks to locate and destroy all of Hezbollah’s attack tunnels.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Has the IDF become the latest prop in Netanyahu's battle for survival?&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the past two months, Northern Command and Military Intelligence concluded with a high degree of certainty that they had identified the existence of several attack tunnels below the border fence into Israel.</p> \n<p>At that point, preparations began for the large-scale engineering operation that began Tuesday morning. The General Staff held periodic discussions on the progress of the tunnel-locating venture, which was coordinated by the head of Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Yoel Strick.</p> \n<p>The army said the rocky terrain near the Lebanese border actually made seismic locating technologies more effective than they were in the sandy terrain near the Gaza Strip. These technologies are based on identifying movements in the earth caused by digging. Thus to monitor the digging in this rocky terrain, the army used different methods than it has in the south.</p> \n<p>Northern Command officers predicted that it will take several weeks to locate and destroy all of Hezbollah’s attack tunnels, or in the worst case a little longer. But this assessment is based on an optimistic intelligence assessment – that the army will be able to identity with a high degree of certainly the entire routes of these tunnels.</p> \n<p>In any case, there are far fewer tunnels up north than the 17 that have been discovered and destroyed along the Gaza border over the past year.</p> \n<p>Judging by Hezbollah’s activity along the northern border, the organization was apparently surprised by Israel’s discovery of the tunnels and did not connect recent developments – including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trip to Brussels to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – with the tunnel issue. But as of Tuesday, no unusual Hezbollah activity was evident along the border in response to Israel’s operation.</p> \n<p>The army predicted that the organization will eschew any military response, at least initially, because Israel is destroying the tunnels on its own side of the border. Still, the military is beefing up its defensive deployment in case an incident occurs, for any reason, that could spark an escalation along the border.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“There will be nothing” isn’t only a good slogan for the prime minister’s defense, it’s a description of Israel’s future. Although it’s a country that has long been led by a political algorithm, starting this week, with the dramatic moment when the police recommended indicting Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel officially entered a leadership vacuum.</p> \n<p>No prime minister, president or king has ever been able to conduct affairs of state and make critical decisions when his phone was tied up in marathon conversations with his lawyers. It’s true there’s no indictment yet, and the decision on filing one – if at all – will be postponed for many months. It’s also true that the prime minister deserves the presumption of innocence.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Unable to charm the media, Netanyahu sought to control it&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;&nbsp;For Netanyahu's supporters, bribery recommendations only serve to support his narrative&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But these reservations have no relevance to Netanyahu’s ability to function as prime minister. He’s now battling for his own survival rather than the country’s.</p> \n<p>This is a situation where governability evaporates. Not only the government, the entire country is a partner to the trial yet to take place. Any decision by the prime minister now, whether forging an agreement with Hamas, funding shelters for battered women, destroying Hezbollah’s tunnels or assisting Holocaust survivors will be examined based on its influence on the trial of the Israeli Dreyfus.</p> \n<p>In the absence of a prime minister, his ministers, who in ordinary times wouldn’t receive an award for outstanding service, will run riot in search of a political future. Who will be interested in education, health, transportation or housing when everyone is rushing to catch the train to the next election?</p> \n<p>The dilemma, however, is far greater when the prime minister is under suspicion: whether to support him or distance yourself from him as from the measles, whether to post on your office door “Here works a candidate for the premiership” or “He’s innocent.” It will be a choir that has lost its conductor and score.</p> \n<p>The safest escape at the moment is to portray Netanyahu as a victim. Still, the police force isn’t an organization that inspires respect, and many of its past recommendations have produced a false pregnancy. The outgoing commissioner is already seen as a vengeful accountant only trying to eliminate the person who appointed him.</p> \n<p>The judicial system is an object of hatred for many Israelis, and of course it was the left and the media who, seeking to bring down the right, forced Netanyahu to receive gifts from billionaire businessman Arnon Milchan and form a bribery alliance with Shaul Elovitch of Bezeq and Walla.</p> \n<p>“We’re all Bibi” will be the rallying cry of Netanyahu’s fans, just as they shouted “We’re all Elor Azaria,” the legendary victim of the military justice system and the left. It won’t take much to dub Bibi “everyone’s child.”</p> \n<p>But these celebrants are only making it worse for themselves when they build a defensive wall around their man. Government corruption is still considered a red line for most Israelis. It sullies not only on the suspect’s expensive suits but his loyalists and party as well.</p> \n<p>The slogan that brought down the Labor Party in 1977 – “We’re fed up with the corrupt!” – has never been shelved.

        "text":["<p>In an expedited process, Knesset members Miki Zohar (Likud) and Shuli Moalem-Refaeli (Habayit Hayehudi) are introducing a bill to block websites. The new version of the legislation greatly expands the definition of “pornographic” content that should be blocked, and the cost in terms of damage to privacy is very high. Also, it’s technically unfeasible. The proposal contributes nothing to protecting children but severely undermines the values of privacy and freedom of expression.</p> \n<p>The bill doesn’t suffice with a prohibition against a display of “sexual relations characterized by violence, abuse, contempt, humiliation or exploitation.” It will also prohibit the display of “sexual relations of any kind” and even “nudity or a human sex organ.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Justice Ministry attorney Gael Azriel rightly noted that “there is a very great expansion of what is currently interpreted as pornographic content based on the Communications Law.” Under the new criteria, even content on popular news websites falls under the definition “pornographic.” There’s a reason why MK Dov Khenin (Joint List) wondered at the most recent discussion, “How will you censor Walla and Ynet?”</p> \n<p>When technology experts tried to explain to Moalem-Refaeli the difficulties in implementing such a law, she said: “There are people here who talk about values, and there are people here who have to translate the values into methods of implementation.” She added: “The value that we want to provide is to prevent children and teenagers from surfing pornographic websites” – as if everyone else supported letting children and teens view such sites.</p> \n<p>Moalem-Refaeli and Zohar present themselves as the purveyors of mitzvot and values, while opposite them is a broken-down bandwagon of secular people devoid of values and loaded with lecherous children and adults.</p> \n<p>The problems with the new version transcend the overly broad definition of pornography. According to the bill, the first time someone wants to reach a porn site, a window will require him to provide his age and Israeli ID number, which will be checked against the Population Registry. From the moment someone does this, the gate will be open for somewhere between three and six months.</p> \n<p>In other words, all parents who key in the code will have removed the fence that protected their children. In addition, the proposed solution requires transferring the Population Registry database to internet companies, and would inevitably lead to the creation of lists of “porn users” that could be misused to harm citizens.</p> \n<p>Moalem-Refaeli and Zohar refuse to understand that those who oppose their proposal want to protect the value of privacy and freedom of expression. Their bill is harmful, useless and would undermine the privacy of adults. It should be rejected, while we should continue to provide sex education and take steps to enforce the law against websites that provide illegal content, based on the existing legislation.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>“Go, and try to understand every word spoken in this chamber, which hover for a moment in its enormous space, before escaping to the sides and above through the many cracks in its walls,” I muttered to myself several weeks ago in Chamber C of Jerusalem’s Supreme Court.</p> \n<p>From those words I could decipher, I learned that in the case being heard there are people seeking to remain living in their homes and there are others who claim that the land under these homes belongs to them, and thus the homes as well. And some claim the destiny of the land is not the destiny of the homes. One belongs to so-and-so and his descendants, while the other belongs to another person and his issue. Plus, there are documents attesting one thing and others attesting to another. And there are documents related to this parcel of land but not to its neighbor.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>I also understood that the petitioners representing the people seeking to stay in their homes – who are making legal arguments on their behalf, pleading persistently, shouting beneath the enormous domes – are wasting their time. For the destiny of the people who have sent them here has already been determined, and the Supreme Court, sitting on high, believes that it does not have the authority to discuss the evidence they bother to formulate in the Hebrew language that is not their own.</p> \n<p>It turns out that all the evidence was already discussed exhaustively in a lower court, which already ruled that the residents are themselves the trespassers. And because they delayed – the proceedings intended to get rid of them were unfortunately for them done without their knowledge – the statute of limitations applies to some of their lawsuits.</p> \n<p>This is not the first time that I have wondered whether the acoustic conditions in this chamber do not bear witness that while justice may be meant to be seen, it is not necessarily meant to be heard. Nor is it the first time that I have thought while sitting in it that perhaps it is better that way. For more than one of the details debated here lack content that should really interest human beings who have the brains to understand and the tools to take interest and learn the facts. And indeed, I know the facts well, and so this list will end with a decisive decision.</p> \n<p>On that fall day, November13, the Supreme Court discussed the fate of dozens of people who have lived for 64 years in Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Israeli law had made it possible for three Israeli associations – the Council of the Sephardi Community in Jerusalem, the Committee of Knesset Israel and Nahalat Shimon – to evict them from their homes and to replace them with other people.</p> \n<p>The judges, after masquerading briefly while as people sincerely and innocently seeking to decide without bias between the attorneys wrangling at their feet, then began to play their true role. They obeyed the law, and with it the policy determining what the law is, and ruled against the petitioners, and in favor of the three associations; the appeal was denied.</p> \n<p>And what does Israeli law state, and in particular, what are its practical implications, what is the personal tragedy to which it condemns its victims? Because the law here serves to cover for usurpation and ideology, things are best explained simply without leaving this issue to legalists.</p> \n<p>A woman my age, sitting with me in her house, from which she is to be evicted, explained the story in simple terms, albeit it with agitation. Here is a summary: Her parents were born in Jaffa and raised there. She was born in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria, to which her family was expelled/fled in 1948. As part of a family reunification program, she went from there to Sheikh Jarrah to live with her husband, who also comes from a family of refugees from Jaffa. That family had been lucky enough to find temporary shelter with relatives in Jerusalem, and the Jordanian regime, the sovereign at the time, allocated her and other refugee families land in Sheikh Jarrah in 1954, and the UNRWA funded the construction of their homes.</p> \n<p>Some 40 members of her family, including her, her children and her grandchildren, live there. Meanwhile, they became subjects of Israel, which tripled the size of Jerusalem in 1967 and extended civilian law over all of it. According to that system of laws and to the decisions of the courts of the new sovereign, the entire compound in Sheikh Jarrah, where hundreds of families live, now belongs to those who made themselves the inheritors of the small Jewish community that had bought it during the Ottoman period.</p> \n<p>Therefore, this family, like its partners in misery who were already evicted and the dozens of others destined to be condemned in future cases – can expect soon to receive notice of an eviction date from the bailiff’s office. If they don’t leave of their own free will, they will be evicted by force in the dead of night. The woman who told me the story kept looking in my eyes, asking: “Perhaps you will tell me where we should go to now? Where to?”</p> \n<p>A week later, on November 21, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of hundreds of other Jerusalem Palestinians – residents of Batan al-Hawa in the Silwan neighborhood. These residents are being harassed by other Israeli groups: Ateret Cohanim and Elad. Regarding this appeal as well, exacting hearings had already been held in Chamber C, and then too I really tried to grasp the legal thinness in their tale before they drift off through the traditional openings in the lofty dome. And this story also deserves being told in the language of man.</p> \n<p>It goes like this: At the end of the 19th century, merciful Jews bought a modest site in the village of Silwan, which then was outside Jerusalem, to build under cover of Ottoman law, a poorhouse for Yemenite Jews who couldn’t find a roof to live under in the holy city. Not many years later, the land was full of violent altercations and the poorhouse residents were forced to evacuate their homes. Years passed. They and their successors spread across the country.</p> \n<p>The country’s rulers changed three times, and self-proclaimed heir also arose: Atret Cohanim. It was clever in various ways – the time was the beginning of this century and Silwan had become a Jerusalem neighborhood crowded with tens of thousands of Palestinians, and the ruler was now the State of Israel – and demanded and received the inheritance from the Administrator General, who had received it from the state, which authorized him to determine what would be done with properties in Jerusalem that had once belonged to Jews. Based on this procedure, the courts in Israel awarded Ateret Cohanim rights to the compound in the heart of Silwan. And now justice will be done without pity.</p> \n<p>You can read in full how everything unfolded, if you want, in the 2015 investigative report published by Nir Hasson in this paper . It’s a tale spiced with bribes paid behind closed doors, people who were tempted to condemn their souls in order to attain a more comfortable life and, above all, the story of M, the resident of a West Bank settlement, whose hand is in everything but whose name it is forbidden to publish, lest it be to his detriment. The story does not end well or fairly, or even with finality, as the rejection of the petition makes clear – it just gets worse.</p> \n<p>Thus, you may want to go the trouble of visiting the neighborhood for yourself, in order to see the explosive and forlorn reality that the splendor of Chamber C in the Supreme Court swallowed in its entirety, like it swallowed the more modest site in Sheikh Jarrah. The law that rules here is the law of naked power. The military regime that embitters the lives of thousands to protect a few dozen Jews, who settled among the thousands in homes whose residents were already evicted, and to protect the stylized national park established next to them for the thousands of visitors streaming here. The sovereign here is the Elad organization. Thanks to its iniquities, you can see how the lives of thousands of Palestinians here are imprisoned and destroyed, and feel the cracks that are gaping in their residences because of the tunnel dug under them for the greater glory of Israel’s ideological archaeology.</p> \n<p>And if you don’t want to venture into areas unfamiliar to you and to your worldview, remain at home, but turn on your honest brain and the integrity of your heart. It will not take much to persuade you that all the legal hairsplitting that has for decades filled the courts of the Jewish-democratic state with hearings on the fate of the homes and lands of people in the territories conquered in 1967 collapses and is crushed like so much straw, in spite of the opposition by lawyers who continue to insist on defending human rights and serving as extras in an absurd farce. For one and only one law whispers yet thunders here behind the scenes, and only that one triumphs over this theater of deceit – the law of the godly promise written in a book that is thousands of years old: “For I give all the land that you see to you and your offspring forever” (Genesis 13:15).</p> \n<p>Thus, this and nothing else is the lesson: Until the statute of limitations is applied to this ancient law, there will be no justice here. For whether the god who made the promise still lives on high and watches his creatures in great sorrow from there, or whether he has been redeemed and died – here, on Earth, in this unholy land, the lives of tens of thousands of people are being destroyed and will be destroyed many times over, because of those who appointed themselves as the arm of power of the sole rulers.</p>",

Under the deal, Allied would take between 5% and 10% of Leumi Card at a 2.5 billion shekel ($670 million) valuation. That is the same valuation at which Warburg agreed to buy control of Leumi Card from Bank Leumi and Azrieli Group. Allied has a low profile, but its holdings include Champion Motors, the Israeli importer of Volkswagen Group cars, and electronics importer Newpan. It shares the concession for the Carmel Tunnels toll road in Haifa, and owns real estate in Israel and abroad. Warburg has been seeking one or more partners for its Leumi Card holding since regulators barred a plan to sell back 20% of the shares to Leumi.

The sellers are Kibbutz Ein Dor and the private equity fund Tene Investment Fund, each of which owns about 50% stake in the maker of cables and wires used primarily in the telecommunications industry. Ein Dor might retain a small stake in Teldor, which operates plants on the kibbutz and at Kibbutz Geshur. For Tene, the valuation means it will have earned relatively little on its Teldor investment. The fund bought its stake from Ein Dor a decade ago at a $46 million valuation, amounting to a return of less than 9% over the life of the investment. If Corning goes through with the acquisition it will be its second in Israel, after its purchase of Mobile Access in 2011 for $180 million. Neither Ein Dor nor Tene would comment on the report.

In a suit brought by Private Equity firm Great Hill Equity Partners, Delaware Chancery Court ruled that Tal had committed fraud in connection with statements he made about the $115 million sale in 2011 of a e-payment-processing company called Plimus, in which he was both a shareholder and CEO. Great Hill alleged that Tal had provided false or distorted seller disclosures before the sale, including failing to disclose problems with payment-clearing providers like Paypal. “The plaintiffs in the case are entitled to restitution for breaches of certain representations and warranties,” Taptica said in statement.&nbsp; Shares of Taptica, which had a net profit of $10.8 million on sales of $144 million in the first half, ended down 37% at 197 pence ($2.52).

Justices asked tough questions of both sides during an hour of oral arguments in an appeal by Helsinn Healthcare of a lower court’s decision to invalidate its patent on Aloxi, which paved the way for Teva to launch a generic version of the drug in March. Aloxi is used to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy. The Supreme Court previously refused Helsinn’s request to block the lower court ruling while it considered the company’s case, allowing Teva to bring its Aloxi copycat to market. Teva claims Helsinn forfeited its patent right by reaching a marketing deal for the drug with another firm before the drug was patented.

        "text":["<p>Israel’s physician shortage has become so acute that the Civil Service Commission is allowing government hospitals to hire retiree doctors back into practice. Desperate medical centers are happy to have them, and to pay them well.</p> \n<p>The new directive, included in a letter sent to hospital heads two weeks ago, targets specialties with the greatest shortages, including psychiatry, internal medicine, emergency medicine, rehabilitation, nuclear medicine and trauma.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>About 100 posts in psychiatry are unfilled at government hospital, with a similar shortfall in clinics and hospitals operated by the country’s health maintenance organization, according to most estimates.</p> \n<p>“At every psychiatric hospital, about 10% to 20% of psychiatric positions are unfilled, and in the community [clinics] the situation is even worse,” said Prof. Yechiel Levkovitz, the head of the Be’er Ya’akov Mental Health Center and head of the psychiatry department at Tel Aviv University’s medical school.</p> \n<p>“The profession has suffered in recent years from a poor image despite the potential there now is to combine the major advances in brain research with talk therapy.”</p> \n<p>The shortage has not only hurt the quality of services psychiatrists can provide but has exacerbated the problem of teaching a new generation of psychiatrists, he said. “If new people don’t join the system there won’t be anyone to train the young generation because when we have to contend with such a severe personnel shortage, there isn’t enough time for training.”</p> \n<p>As it is, many hospitals have contended with the overall doctor shortage in recent years by convincing physicians not to retire when they could. Doctors are allowed to remain at their jobs until age 70 and continue to accumulate more pension rights.</p> \n<p>At Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel’s biggest hospital, about 150 doctors of retirement age remain on the staff — those up to age 70 working half-time and up to age 73 one-quarter time. A few have even stayed on after age 73.</p> \n<p>“At age 67 doctors are still strong, they contribute a lot and are very experienced,” said Prof. Yitshak Kreiss, Sheba’s director general. “Many of them provide unique medical services and continue to teach students. Nothing changes in a 67-year-old when he wakes up and he is 67 and one, so why not continue working? “</p> \n<p>The one rule Sheba imposes on them is that they can’t fill managerial positions. “It’s important to advance the young,” said Kreiss.</p> \n<p>What is new is not the employment of older physicians, but that the Civil Service Commission is now letting government hospitals hire them back after they have officially retired.</p> \n<p>To lure them back, the commission is allowing hospitals to offer them salary and conditions identical to what they enjoyed just before they retired — which usually means they resume getting the highest pay of their careers. The generous terms reflect how desperate the commission is to fill jobs.</p> \n<p>In addition to the specialties with acute shortages, hospitals in Israel’s north and south are contending with shortfalls across the board.</p> \n<p>“Where there are problems nationwide, we in the periphery feel it even more, “said Dr. Erez Onn, director of Poriya Medical Center in Tiberias. “Our ability to persuade a doctor from the center [of the country] to come to the north with all the promises for quality of life is almost zero.”</p> \n<p>Hospital in the periphery tempt applications with offers of managerial posts and are authorized to make 500,000 shekel ($134,000) signing bonuses. But, said Onn, it’s not enough to compensate doctors to give up lucrative private clinics and barely covers the costs of relocating.</p> \n<p>Onn said he hoped approval to hire retired doctors would help alleviate the problem. “If I haven’t been able to hire an oncologist for two years and I can continue with some that has completed his post as a unit head, that gives me breathing room,” he said.</p> \n<p>That said, he added: “It’s a temporary solution, an option of new choice.” He said the real solution was to allow hospitals like his to offer better packages to doctors, including help for spouses to find employment and help in schools for their children.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A speech by Rod Rosenstein — the U.S. deputy attorney general is best known for his role in the Mueller investigation, but his purview also includes corporate crime — could spell bad news for Bank Hapoalim and Mizrahi Tefahot Bank.</p> \n<p>The two lenders are the subjects of a lengthy investigation by the U.S. Justice Department into their alleged roles in helping American citizens evade U.S. taxes from 2000 to 2011. Both banks have already set aside hundreds of millions of shekels in expectation of penalties.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In a speech to the 35th International Conference on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in Washington on Thursday, Rosenstein outlined a new policy regarding steps companies will be required to take in order to win the cooperation of the Justice Department and negotiate a settlement.</p> \n<p>The main message Rosenstein relayed was that agreements would be difficult to reach unless the executives involved are required to personally pay fines and even be forced to resign if they are still in their jobs.</p> \n<p>“It is important to impose penalties on corporations that engage in misconduct. Cases against corporate entities allow us to recover fraudulent proceeds, reimburse victims, and deter future wrongdoing,” he said.</p> \n<p>But Rosenstein went on to say: “The most effective deterrent to corporate criminal misconduct is identifying and punishing the people who committed the crimes. So we revised our policy to make clear that absent extrao rdinary circumstances, a corporate resolution should not protect individuals from criminal liability.</p> \n<p>Our revised policy also makes clear that any company seeking cooperation credit in criminal cases must identify every individual who was substantially involved in or responsible for the criminal conduct.”</p> \n<p>Among Israeli bankers, the new policy is most relevant to Eldad Fresher, the CEO of Mizrahi since 2013. Before and during the year the alleged tax violations occurred, he was chairman of the bank’s Swiss unit and head of its financial division, responsible for international activities. Dan Lubasch, Mizrahi Switzerland’s CEO since 2011, may also be affected.</p> \n<p>Most of the senior Hapoalim executives connected with the alleged affair have left the bank, but a number of middle managers who remained now find themselves in the Justice Department’s crosshairs.</p> \n<p>Of the three Israeli banks that have been investigated, only Bank Leumi has settled — agreeing to pay a $400 million penalty four years ago. That, however, may not be a good barometer for what Hapoalim will have to pay, on top of the threat that individual executives will also face penalties.</p> \n<p>In August, the Justice Department offered Mizrahi — Israel’s third-largest bank, but much smaller than Leumi and Hapoalim — a settlement that included a $342 million fine.</p> \n<p>Mizrahi rejected it, but also opted to set aside another $116.5 million in its second-quarter financial report, in expectation of a future penalty. Until then, its provisions had amounted to just $162 million. Meantime, the two sides are negotiating.</p> \n<p>At Hapoalim, the provisions connected with the probe have reached $365 million, with total costs, including legal fees, of 2 billion shekels ($540 million). It’s not clear when the bank will settle with U.S. authorities.</p> \n<p>In any event, Rosenstein made clear that the U.S. would not pursue every employee of a company that committed offenses, especially if their role was insubstantial and is unlikely to lead to prosecution.</p> \n<p>“We want to focus on the individuals who play significant roles in setting a company on a course of criminal conduct. We want to know who authorized the misconduct, and what they knew about it,” he said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A young man has complained that Rabbi Mordechai Elon had sexually harassed him while counseling him, reported investigative television show “Uvda“ Tuesday. Elon, once a major figure in the religious Zionist community, was convicted five years ago on two counts of forcible indecent acts against a 17-year-old male student.</p> \n<p>Elon, the former head of Yeshivat Hakotel in Jerusalem, was charged in 2012 with sexually assaulting two of his students in 2003 and 2005. The investigation began three years earlier.</p> \n<p>The young man complained to Forum Takana, a group of leading rabbis and other leaders of the religious Zionist community that was established for the purpose of preventing sexual abuse by authority figures in the community. Takana was the group that received the original complaints about Elon eight years ago that led to his conviction.</p> \n<p>The young man approached Elon for counseling on personal issues. The meetings, parts of which were recorded, began to have a “sexual nature,” said the report. Members of Forum Takana, which has taken on a role of helping to deal with legal issues concerning sexual abuse, recommended that the young man go to the police, but he chose instead to address the issue by consulting with senior rabbis.</p> \n<p>These rabbis confronted Elon with the complaints, and he did not deny them. Members of Forum Takana demanded that he take responsibility for his actions, but as of now Elon has not done so.</p> \n<p>Yehudit Shilat, the director of Forum Takana, told Haaretz: “We are unable to comment on the matter at this stage.”</p> \n<p>Elon declined to comment.</p> \n<p>After the earlier accusations became public, Elon resigned as head of Yeshivat Hakotel and moved to Migdal, a small town in northern Israel. He was sentenced to six months of community service and 15 months of probation and was ordered to pay compensation to the victim.</p> \n<p>While most of the religious Zionist community denounced Elon, some major figures in the community continued to support him. Rabbi Haim Druckman, the head of the Bnei Akiva youth movement, even let Elon continue to teach at Ohr Etzion Yeshiva, which Druckman heads.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The pair of teens sailing on their scooters among the women streaming into Rabin Square for the main event of the day of protest against violence toward women probably couldn’t believe their good luck. I guess they hadn’t been following the news and they found themselves in the middle of the women’s protest: more and more women flowing down Ibn Gabirol Street. Besides satisfaction, their smiles indicated a sort of embarrassment. They were suddenly a minority, darting among packs of girls with megaphones and signs.</p> \n<p>The taxi driver I rode with to the square, who didn’t believe the demonstration would draw more than 50 women, said that protests like this don’t do any good and that violence against women is an Arab thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Israeli army operation couldn't hold back outrage over violence against women&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;A cry against contempt for women’s lives | Editorial&nbsp;■&nbsp;&nbsp;'We Are All Sexually Harassed in the Israeli Army, Almost on a Daily Basis</p> \n<p>“Why aren’t there more men here,” I asked a male activist from a socialist organization who was passing out fliers. “The oppression of women is the greatest oppression in human culture, I really don’t understand why more men didn’t come,” he said.</p> \n<p>I think I got a better answer from a passerby who found himself among the crowd, and not to his benefit. He thought he heard one of the speakers use the term “spiritual violence” and he started shouting that he doesn’t understand what that means. I was reminded of a man who burst into one of the demonstrations that morning, written on his shirtless back: “I’m not a murderer.” That protester, like the passerby, are like rough arrows springing from some primeval male subconscious. They bypass the fine words and the obvious condemnation of the murders.</p> \n<p>When women’s protests become truly unpleasant — when women fight not only for their right to not be murdered, but also for a real slice of control and leadership — will we see more men who consider women’s protests an assault on them, an existential assault?&nbsp; Will men really agree to give up their ancient privileges, to which, out of habit and superiority, they are simply, utterly blind?</p> \n<p>No offense to the noble men who did come to the demonstration, but it was impossible to ignore either the decisive female majority, or their type. Except for the bagel hawker — the sign of a successful protest is when there’s profit to be made — and a protester who came dressed as a Muslim clergyman and also spoke Arabic (who said: “no to violence and control of women”) most of the men there were typical left-wing protesters.</p> \n<p>The women who were there were also mostly the obvious suspects known from liberal demonstrations, some of the few rays of light lately: Jewish, well-heeled and well-groomed women, apparently from Tel Aviv or the center of the country. Truly weak women don’t have the time, the strength or the breath to protest their situation. They have to survive.</p> \n<p>Still, we shouldn’t discount the achievements of this impressive protest, which began as the initiative of three young women who went with their heart and still managed to force the distress of women onto the Israeli agenda (which always finds reasons to postpone it). This was not the critical and syrupy masses of the LGBT protest or the “Druze protest” against the nation-state law, and we’ve already mentioned the small number of men, but the square was full.</p> \n<p>And it was full of the energy of power, of success and of achievement. And because this was a women’s protest, the energy thermometer was different. There was no uncontrollable excitement or confrontational passion to burn the house down. You could feel a kind of slightly sad but powerful quiet. Like a quiet motor that refuses to declare itself working with an ostentatious roar. The quiet of a woman at work.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tuesday’s news about Israel launching an operation to demolish cross-border tunnel Hezbollah built from Lebanon into Israel puts in new light Avigdor Lieberman’s decision to step down as defense minister in the middle of last month. In Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech on November 18, following Lieberman’s departure and Education Minister Naftali Bennett’s demand for the defense portfolio, the prime minister said that the country was facing a period of security challenges – and that a “sacrifice” would be required of the public.</p> \n<p>Lieberman played down Netanyahu’s remarks, and apparently so did the Habayit Hayehudi ministers, who decided the next day to remain in the government and weren’t persuaded by the talk of a danger of war.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;| Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;Has the Israel; become the latest prop in Netanyahu's battle for survival?&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Is Operation Northern Shield major or minor? Apparently neither. But on Tuesday someone energetically briefed journalists on the events of the past few months. According to that version, there’s a close link between the latest developments in Gaza and in the north. Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, it is claimed, have exaggerated the tunnel threat in the north as way to postpone necessary action in Gaza.</p> \n<p>People involved in the discussions told Haaretz that the security cabinet and a few other forums have been receiving intelligence updates on the tunnels in the north in recent months. On November 7, the engineering operation on the Lebanese border came up for discussion in the security cabinet, which voted to approve it, with the exception of one minister, Lieberman. The defense minister believed that a ground operation in Gaza was more urgent.</p> \n<p>The engineering operation in the north was to begin a week later. But on the night of November 11, Israeli special forces near Khan Yunis in Gaza got into trouble and a lieutenant colonel was killed.</p> \n<p>The next day the Palestinians responded with a barrage of 500 rockets and mortar shells. On November 13, the security cabinet held a dramatic meeting where it was decided to consent to Egyptian efforts toward a cease-fire and go back to seeking an agreement with Hamas. On November 14, Lieberman announced his resignation and sharply criticized what he described as defeatist Israeli policy in Gaza.</p> \n<p>In the security cabinet meeting of November 13, Eisenkot led the argument against a ground operation in Gaza, backed by Netanyahu (some would say the prime minister did so at a rather low pitch). Some of the ministers recall that the tunnel issue in the north was mentioned briefly.</p> \n<p>But as far as is known, this wasn’t the main argument. The main reason for the decision to stop was that Netanyahu and Eisenkot were against an operation in Gaza and the army didn’t have enough quality targets for an assault because the escalation didn’t begin with a surprise Israeli move and Hamas leaders had already hidden deep underground.</p> \n<p>The argument that comes up in retrospect is that Netanyahu and Eisenkot were leery about a Gaza operation, so they provided a relatively safe operation, but less essential, in the north. Such an operation serves the prime minister in two ways: It distracts the public’s attention only two days after the police recommended indicting him in the Bezeq-Walla case, and it once again presents him as an uber-statesman, the only politician who can meet the complex and changing challenges that Israel faces in the region.</p> \n<p>Also, Eisenkot gets his operation, a moment before his term ends on January 15. The chief of staff thus clears his desk of the tunnel problem in the north, though his successor, Aviv Kochavi, will apparently have to address the threat from Gaza and the developing crisis around the Iranian missile factories in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>This is also the source of the charges, coming from both the right and left, of a PR operation that needlessly frightens the public. The army is responding by releasing details on the threat (the tunnel uncovered extended 40 meters [131 feet] into Israel, under the bicycle trail in Metula).</p> \n<p>But it seems the whole discussion is being held based on who’s for Netanyahu and who’s against him. One can only guess what will happen if he decides to stay on as prime minister and defense minister if he’s indicted in the corruption cases against him.</p> \n<p>North versus south</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s trip to Brussels apparently had two components: coordinating with the Americans regarding action against the tunnels in the north, and conveying another sharp warning to the Lebanese government – try to rein in Hezbollah and avoid an escalation on the border.</p> \n<p>The question now preoccupying Israel’s leaders is how Iran will respond and whether it will seek a way to make Israel pay, perhaps on another border, for thwarting its plans. The tunnel project is a costly, secret matter of critical importance to Iran and Hezbollah. Clearly the Iranians were in the picture, and part of the insights relied on know-how gained by Hamas in its Gaza tunnels over the past decade.</p> \n<p>The IDF made a technological and intelligence breakthrough in locating the Gaza tunnels about a year ago, and since then has found and demolished 17 attack tunnels on both sides of the border fence. But this success also gradually contributed to the deterioration with Hamas and spurred the group to heat things up at the fence via the March of the Return starting on March 30.</p> \n<p>On the northern border, digging tunnels, like discovering them, is an incomparably tougher task. The IDF shared three key details Tuesday: The realization in 2012 that when Hezbollah talks about a plan to “conquer the Galilee” this includes a surprise attack through tunnels, the establishment in 2014 of a special team to study the problem, and frequent efforts to discover tunnels in recent years.</p> \n<p>The army doesn’t care how many years passed between the time the tunnels were dug and when they were discovered (the tunnel made public Tuesday was dug over two years). Nor does it say whether it suspects there are more tunnels and whether this operation should have been launched a few months ago.</p> \n<p>Still, a significant security challenge has been uncovered that will require close management by Netanyahu, Eisenkot and the head of the Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Yoel Strick. The effort to find more tunnels is expected to take weeks, if not months.</p> \n<p>And the tunnels aren’t the only urgent issue. Israel is also warning about Iran’s plan to establish factories in Lebanon to produce precision weapons – and is getting used to the change dictated by Russia’s presence in the region. Moscow has largely closed the skies over Syria to offensive action by the IAF but has forced Iran to cut back on its weapons-smuggling convoys.</p>",

(Among Layla Tov's founders are three Haaretz employees).</p> \n<p>The installation was inspired by the work of Mexican artist Elina Chauvet, who in 2009 began exhibiting similar displays of shoes around the world in a kind of silent protest at public apathy over female murder victims. The organizers of the Tel Aviv installation contacted Chauvet recently on social media.

(And of course Israel hasn’t refrained either from taking action violating Lebanese and Syrian sovereignty; in recent years, the Israel Air Force has attacked Syrian territory hundreds of times and has frequently flown over Lebanon to collect intelligence information and as a deterrence).</p> \n<p>The Israeli move now deprives Hezbollah of an important offensive card that the Lebanese militia group had been saving in the event war breaks out. From its standpoint, this is a major operational disappointment, but it's far from constituting a reason to start a war at this time. According to the assessments in Israel, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is not interested in war and actually serves as a restraining force in decision-making among Tehran, Damascus and Beirut – despite his frequent public threats.</p> \n<p>The Israeli prime minister's trip to Brussels on Monday apparently had two components: Coordination with the Americans on Israel's military steps to find the tunnels, and conveying another strong warning signal to the Lebanese government that it should sit quietly and try to rein in Hezbollah to prevent an escalation along the border.</p> \n<p>The more disturbing question is how Iran will react in the future – and whether it will find a way to exact a price from Israel, perhaps on another border, for foiling its operational plans. Undertaking the tunnel project has been an expensive, secret venture of critical importance to Iran and Hezbollah. It's clear that the Iranians have also been in the picture – and that some of the operational insights have relied on knowledge gained by Hamas in its own underground activity in the Gaza Strip over the past decade.</p> \n<p>The Israeli defense establishment achieved a technological and intelligence breakthrough in finding the tunnels in Gaza about a year ago, and has since located and destroyed nearly 15 attack tunnels on both sides of the Israeli-Gaza border. But this important operational success also gradually contributed to the deterioration later on between Israel and Hamas and prompted Hamas to deliberately heat things up along the Gaza border with Israel, with the demonstrations that began at the end of March.</p> \n<p>Digging tunnels in the ground, like locating the tunnels, on the northern border is an immeasurably difficult task. The Israeli army disclosed minimal detail on Tuesday regarding its preparations in this regard in recent years - an understanding formulated in 2012 that when Hezbollah talks about a future plan to &quot;conquer the Galilee,&quot; it also includes plans for a surprise attack through tunnels; and convening a special team in 2014 to examine the problem and frequent efforts in recent years to find tunnels.</p> \n<p>The Israeli army has yet to reveal how many years have elapsed since the tunnels were dug and how long it was until they were discovered (but it was apparently a considerable period); whether it suspects that there are more tunnels in addition to those that have been found; and whether there might have been reason to undertake such a step several months back when the ongoing preparations to act began.</p> \n<p>Another question relates to the political realm. In a speech on November 18, Netanyahu said the country was expecting a period with security challenges and added that the public would be required to &quot;sacrifice.&quot; The outgoing defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, minimized the importance of the comments, and apparently the members of the cabinet from the Habayit Hayehudi party, who decided to stay in the government, were not convinced that there was a danger of war.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, on Tuesday morning, a significant security challenge was disclosed that now requires close personal involvement from the prime minister, from army Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot and from the head of the army's Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Yoel Strick. It should be remembered that the tunnels are not the only urgent issue on the agenda. Israel has also been warning of the consequences of Iran's plans to set up precision weaponry plants for Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Israel also needs to be prepared for changes being dictated by Russia, which to a great extent has closed Syrian airspace to attacks by the Israel Air Force, but has also forced Iran to curtail its weapons smuggling convoys.</p>",

Gen. Ronen Manelis, told reporters. &quot;Some of [the scenarios] will not be in our territory and this is something we are preparing for.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Force announced the discovery of the tunnels on Tuesday morning, saying it has started destroying them, dubbing the campaign Operation&nbsp;Northern Shield.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Attack tunnels drom Lebanon: Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive Asset&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu's meeting with Pompeo is a warning to Iran and Lebanon - before Israel takes military action &nbsp; Israel has warned Lebanon and UNIFIL, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Lebanon, that anyone who approaches the area puts himself in danger, Manelis said.</p> \n<p>He added that the tunnel revealed on Tuesday was dug from a private home in Kafr Kila in southern Lebanon. It took two years to build, he said, and stretches some 200 meters – 40 of which are inside Israeli territory.</p> \n<p>Contrary to the Gaza tunnels, Manelis added, these tunnels have air conditioning, lighting and are tall enough for people to walk upright.</p> \n<p>After the 2014 Gaza war, Manelis said, Israel &quot;understood that there is an underground threat against Israel that needs to be removed. Two teams are created: One in the south, which has so far exposed some 17 tunnels, and another [team] on the Northern Command, which operated under the assumption that if there are tunnels in the south, it is likely there are [tunnels] in the north.&quot;</p> \n<p>Operation Northern Shield, added Manelis, will last several weeks: &quot;Some actions will be more precise and some less. At this point we are operating within Israeli territory to seize the tunnels… in the future, these tunnels may be destroyed from other locations.&quot;</p> \n<p>Manelis said that &quot;The decision to keep the operation a secret was made in order to surprise Hezbollah,&quot; adding that the timing of the launch was determined after all of the intelligence and technological conditions were right. &quot;This operation wasn't approved last night,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that there had already been &quot;operational successes&quot; in the operation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Whoever tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that Israel &quot;is operating divisively and responsibly on all fronts simultaneously.

Gadi Eisenkot, the head of the National Security Council and other defense officials.</p> \n<p>The security cabinet has convened to discuss further developments in the operation.</p> \n<p>Israeli envoy to the United Nations Danny Danon called upon the UN Security Council to convene following the discovery of the attack tunnels.</p> \n<p>&quot;Hezbollah continues to act under the funding, guidance and sponsorship of Iran.

        "text":["<p>In an unusual ruling, the Nazareth Traffic Court harshly criticized the Judea and Samaria Police, maintaining that it had revoked the license of a left-wing activist illegally, only because of his political views. Judge Bassam Kandaleft ruled that the reason for revoking the license was “apparently in order to scare him and deter him from continuing in his ways in future,” and ordered the decisions overturned. The conduct of the police “has no place in a proper, democratic government,” he said.</p> \n<p>On November 19 police from the Judea and Samaria District detained Guy Hirshfeld, a member of the left-wing organization Taayush, while he was driving in the northern Jordan Valley. They demanded to examine him on suspicion that he was driving under the influence of drugs. Hirshfeld told them that he had marijuana in his car, but explained that he was authorized to use medical cannabis. In the end the police searched the car and found the drug, but returned it to him.</p> \n<p>Despite Hirschfeld’s explanation, he was charged with driving under the influence, his license was suspended for 30 days and his car was impounded. Hirshfeld has had previous run-ins with the police, over his political activity.</p> \n<p>Hirshfeld asked the court in order to withdraw the charges. Kandaleft accepted his arguments, and criticized the police, saying the incident was based on Hirshfeld’s political affiliations.</p> \n<p>The judge added that this assertion is based on the actions of the policeman and not on assumptions: “A summons to trial and an indictment were prepared on the spot, although the basic investigation of the plaintiff’s case had not yet been completed, and there was not yet an acceptable and legal opinion that could prove that a dangerous drug was found in the body of the plaintiff while he was driving. … So that the summons to trial, which the police rushed to write for the plaintiff, was unfounded and even defective.”</p> \n<p>The judge said that the police conducted a search of Hirshfeld’s car although he has a permit to use the drug. He added that Hirshfeld “cooperated with the police and displayed the drug that he keeps in his car legally and gave a urine sample at the policeman’s request.”</p> \n<p>It was decided that there is no evidentiary foundation for charging Hirshfeld, and that it is not clearly in the public interest. The judge asserted that one clear finding remains — all the steps that were taken against the plaintiff were taken because he is a human rights activists.”</p> \n<p>According to the police, “As opposed to what was claimed, the driver was caught driving under the influence of drugs. He had in his possession a substance suspected of being a drug — an illegal act that creates a genuine risk for drivers and pedestrians, and therefore his license was revoked and his vehicle was confiscated. The indictment was filed after the accused confessed to the crime attributed to him and the enforcement was unrelated to the driver’s political views.”</p> \n<p>The police are appealing the ruling.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Chances are, if you’ve heard of Hanukkah, you’ve heard of the miraculous jug of oil that lasted eight days instead of one, the Maccabees, and of their hero, the warrior Judah. But there’s another hero — or in this case, heroine — associated with the Hanukkah story, and while her story is less well known, it’s just as awe-inspiring.</p> \n<p>Judith was a young, beautiful widow who lived in the second century B.C.E. in the town of Bethulia. When Bethulia came under siege by the notoriously cruel Assyrian general Holofernes, and the townspeople were close to surrender, Judith stepped in. She begged her people to have faith and asked them to give her a chance before they gave up. They did, and that night, she and her maid set out for the enemy camp.</p> \n<p>Judith walked confidently into the camp and demanded to be taken to the general. Once in his tent, she presented herself as a Jewish sympathizer and promised Holofernes she’d help him take down Bethulia. The general, who was instantly smitten, invited her to a feast.</p> \n<p>Judith came prepared. She brought her briny, homemade goat cheese to the feast, persuaded the general to partake of the salty dairy and when he got thirsty, plied him with strong, undiluted wine. In a matter of minutes he had passed out, and lay sprawled across his tent in a drunken stupor. Judith, alone with him in the tent, uttered a silent prayer asking for help and strength. And then, in one swift motion, she unsheathed his sword and beheaded him.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;The revolt of the Maccabees: The true story behind Hanukkah</p> \n<p>Suffice it to say, Bethulia emerged victorious. Judith brought Holofernes’ severed head back to her community elders, who then launched a surprise attack on the Assyrians. The Assyrians, who found their commander laying headless in his tent, fled.</p> \n<p>Judith had courage and bravery in spades, and today, in her honor, it’s customary to eat dairy on Hanukkah. I love this gratin for Hanukkah parties because it feeds a crowd, incorporates cheese and features these thinly sliced potatoes — it’s like one big, cheesy latke. The kale is a hearty addition that breaks up all the creamy, cheesy goodness, and the garlic, thyme and bay leaves add flavor.</p> \n<p>Raclette is a particular type of Swiss cheese that becomes nutty and melty when it is heated up, but you could also use gruyere if you cannot find Raclette.</p> \n<p>It’s delicious, but best of all, it’s a reminder of the strength women have within, and that a single act of courage can change the course of history. Eat cheese — and celebrate Hanukkah and great Jewish women!\\</p> \n<p>Ingredients:</p> \n<p>Butter, for the dish</p> \n<p>2 1/2 cups heavy cream</p> \n<p>2 garlic cloves, minced</p> \n<p>3 fresh bay leaves</p> \n<p>3 sprigs fresh thyme</p> \n<p>5 whole black peppercorns</p> \n<p>1 tablespoon ground mustard seed</p> \n<p>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</p> \n<p>1 tablespoon kosher salt</p> \n<p>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</p> \n<p>4 pounds russet potatoes, scrubbed and thinly sliced</p> \n<p>4 cups washed curly or lacinato kale, chopped and stem removed</p> \n<p>4 ounces Raclette cheese (1 cup), finely grated (can also use gruyere)</p> \n<p>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Directions:</p> \n<p>1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Butter the inside of a 3-quart baking dish.</p> \n<p>2. Bring the heavy cream, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, peppercorns, mustard and nutmeg to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Let cool slightly. Remove bay leaves, thyme and peppercorns from sauce. Season the cream mixture with salt and pepper.</p> \n<p>3. Fan out a layer of potatoes on the bottom of the buttered casserole dish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and top with 1 cup of the kale. Pour 1/4 of the cream mixture on top. Sprinkle with 1/4 of the grated cheese mixture. Repeat with 3 more layers, reserving the last 1/4 cup of cheese.</p> \n<p>4. Bake potatoes until tender and creamy, around 1 hour. Then cover the potatoes with foil and let bake for another 30-35 minutes, or until the cream is bubbling and the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork.</p> \n<p>5. Place rack in highest position; heat broiler. Mix the breadcrumbs with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese and sprinkle over the potatoes.</p> \n<p>6. Broil until cheese is bubbling and top of gratin is golden brown, 7-10 minutes. Serve topped with sprigs of fresh thyme leaves, if desired.

The two discussed ways to &quot;work together to block Iranian agression in the region - in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon.&quot; The heads of the Mossad and the National Security Council, as well as Netanyahu's military secretary, also attended the meeting.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;| Analysis ■&nbsp;Netanyahu's meeting with Pompeo is a warning to Iran and Lebanon - before Israel takes military action&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>The military said it has been aware since 2006 that Hezbollah was trying to construct attack tunnels stretching from Lebanon into Israel at several points along the border. Since then, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has spoken of a plan to take over parts of the Galilee, in northern Israel, in a future conflict.</p> \n<p>Nasrallah is expected to give a speech in Lebanon on Tuesday evening in response to the launch of the operation.</p> \n<p>The miltiary said it was assessing the situation to gauge Hezbollah's possible reaction to the destruction of the tunnels. The army warned farmers not to approach the border.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that there had already been &quot;operational successes&quot; in the operation.&nbsp;&quot;Whoever tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that Israel &quot;is operating divisively and responsibly on all fronts simultaneously. We will continue with further actions – public and clandestine – in order to safeguard the security of Israel.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>New&nbsp;perspective to political crisis</p> \n<p>The revelation of Operation Northern Shield brings new perspective to the security cabinet debates surrounding the&nbsp;cease-fire with Hamas&nbsp;in Gaza. Now we can say that the tunnels in the north were among the considerations in the security cabinet meeting where the ministers decided not to launch a full-scale operation in Gaza following a botched Israeli military operation there and the firing of some 500 rockets from Gaza at Israel.</p> \n<p>Most of the ministers had agreed, in accordance with the defense establishment's position, that an offensive in Gaza was not appropriate at the time, out of fear of escalation on two fronts. Lieberman, who&nbsp;resigned his post as defense minister&nbsp;following the cease-fire announcement, disagreed with the assessment that the northern front required immediate action. He insisted that the situation in Gaza was more pressing.</p> \n<p>Several ministers have criticized Netanyahu for using classified information about the tunnels and the operation to justify delaying elections. According to them, the level of the threat did not justify a delay in dissolving the coalition.</p> \n<p>Since the revelation of the operation on Tuesday, most of the ministers support the decision for a cease-fire in Gaza. The prime minister's bureau instructed ministers not to give interviews for fear of complicating the situation with Hezbollah. When&nbsp;Netanyahu spoke of security threats&nbsp;that he could not disclose in November, it can be assumed that the northern front was one of the threats.</p> \n<p>Not an immediate threat</p> \n<p>The construction of the tunnels is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, IDF Spokesperson Ronen Manelis told Army Radio Tuesday.</p> \n<p>&quot;We've been preparing for this morning for a very long time,&quot; Manelis said.</p> \n<p>&quot;I don't want to talk about the number [of tunnels], those details will stay classified,&quot; said Manelis, &quot;It suffices to say that it is a small number. Work has started near Metullah, and in the coming days the operation will expand to other sections of the homefront.&quot;</p> \n<p>Manelis added that the tunnels did not constitute an immediate threat and they were still unfinished.</p> \n<p>In 2013, the military discovered that Hezbollah was attempting to begin construction of the tunnels but could not locate any. In 2014, the military formed a special team to locate these tunnels, and in 2015 it began building a barrier along the Lebanese border. During this time, the military developed tunnel-locating technology.</p> \n<p>&quot;The fact that Hezbollah has tunnels crossing the border into Israeli territory is proof of a flagrant violation of Israeli sovreignty,&quot;&nbsp;Manelis said. &quot;We see this as a very serious situation that hurts Lebanon and the citizens of Lebanon, and we hold the Lebanese government accountable. We have indisputable proof that the Lebanese government is not in control of their border. Iranian money is behind these tunnels.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to Manelis, Israeli troops along the border have been reinforced, &quot;We are in full control of the situation and are determined to remove the underground Hezbollah threat from the northern border. The tunnels do cross into Israeli territory, but the work on them was not complete.&quot;</p> \n<p>Since 2013, residents in the north have reported hearing sounds of digging emanating from under the ground. Manelis told army radio that each report had been investigated, yet the army maintained that no tunnels had been found under the northern border.</p> \n<p>The army has long been aware of Hezbollah's intention to build tunnels, yet it is unclear at what point they discovered the tunnels that are currently being destroyed.</p>",

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller&nbsp;released new documents on Tuesday outlining his office’s cooperation with Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p> \n<p>In the documents, Mueller details how an interaction with Russia over Israeli settlements in the West Bank led to Flynn’s legal troubles and turned him, eventually, into a cooperating witness on the Russia probe.</p> \n<p>Mueller asked a federal court in Washington, which is supposed to sentence Flynn for lying to the FBI, not to send the retired general to prison.</p> \n<p>Throughout the course of 19 interviews, Flynn has provided “substantial” information to the Russia investigation and to other crimes that could not be made public at the moment, Mueller said.</p> \n<p>It was further detailed that Flynn provided &quot;firsthand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;The countless Israeli connections to Mueller’s probe of Trump and Russia | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A major part of Mueller’s 13-page document deals with an event from December 2016, during which Flynn contacted the Russian ambassador to the United States and asked him to veto a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel’s settlements in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The vote took place during the transition period between the Obama and Trump administrations.

Such funding, according to the committee, might harm the public's trust in government.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the committee stated that Netanyahu did not provide answers for &quot;basic questions,&quot; such as the amount of money he wishes to raise, the sum each of the potential sponsors are willing to provide or the legal fees already charged for each of the prime minister's cases.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu may not have to resign, but he should | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Has the Israeli army become the latest prop in Netanyahu's battle for survival?</p> \n<p>The committee, whose three membes include a former district court judge and former officials in the State Comptroller Office, reached its decision on Thursday. Attorney Navot Tel-Zur, head of Netanyahu's defense team, asked on Monday for a 30-day delay before publishing the committee's decision, but the latter declined his request.</p> \n<p>Last year Partrich&nbsp;testified as part of the investigation into Case 1000 and was asked by police to explain the gifts he had given Netanyahu in recent years. He confirmed that he had purchased suits costing tens of thousands of shekels for the prime minister, but said Netanyahu’s cousin, American businessman Milikowsky, had returned the money to him later.</p> \n<p>Milikowsky was also called upon to give evidence after Haaretz reported that Netanyahu had claimed under questioning that he had purchased cigars using cash that he'd received from a relative. Police recently recommended to charge Netanyahu with bribery over Case 1000, as well as two additional cases, mainly dealing with the prime minister's relations with the media.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's request to accept funding from the two witnesses was submitted in April to his legal advisor Shlomit Barnea-Farago, who asked AG Mendelblit to conclude whether the prime minister was allowed to receive funding from Partrich&nbsp;and Milkowsky.

The committee is responsible for discussing requests of ministers and deputy ministers regarding money and potential conflicts of interest.</p> \n<p>However, Mendelblit's decision did not make any reference to the fact the both tycoons have testified as part of the investigation.</p> \n<p>The attorney general suggested that the committee set conditions for the approval, including a commitment to use the funds solely for the premier’s legal defense; that there be a cap on the amount and that there be a reporting mechanism. Mendelblit also instructed that a conflict of interest agreement be formulated that would relate to the relationship between the prime minister and Partrich&nbsp;and Milikowsky, and forbid the premier to deal with any issues that involve them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>FAIR LAWN, New Jersey – It’s not every day that two chess grandmasters move to Israel, although at least Boris Gulko and his wife Anna know what to expect.</p> \n<p>If everything goes according to plan, early next year the Gulkos will move to Israel, where they have already bought an apartment in Jerusalem’s Beit Hakerem neighborhood. It will surely be a less dramatic arrival than 32 years ago when, after seven years of trying, the couple was finally granted visas to leave the Soviet Union and become Israeli citizens.</p> \n<p>“We spent a month in a merkaz klita [absorption center] in Jerusalem,” Boris Gulko recalls about his time in Israel in the spring of 1986. “It was the most exciting month of my life! I was reborn and didn’t stop smiling the whole time. After living my whole life in the Soviet Union, I was finally a free man for the first time in my life.”</p> \n<p>But freedom wasn’t everything for an ambitious and accomplished chess player who had yet to turn 40. “I soon realized I wouldn’t be able to live as a professional chess player in Israel and so moved to the United States,” he tells Haaretz, speaking in his modest house in Fair Lawn, northern New Jersey.</p> \n<p>Now 71, Boris Gulko is finally ready to leave the chessboard behind – at least professionally. And he hopes his four American granddaughters will join him eventually, saying, “My dream is that one day they will make aliyah and live there as well.”</p> \n<p>‘Jewish feelings’</p> \n<p>Boris Gulko enjoyed an illustrious career in chess. At 29 he was a grandmaster (the highest honor awarded by the world chess federation, second only to winning the world championship) and is the only male chess player to win both the Soviet and American championships (the Russian title in 1977; the U.S. title in 1994 and 1999). He is also the only player to beat fellow grandmaster Garry Kasparov no fewer than three times.</p> \n<p>For seven years, from 1979-1986, Gulko was a &quot;refusenik&quot; in the Soviet Union: &quot;The seven lean years,&quot; he once told Haaretz. Before that, from 1972-1979, he was a rising star in the Soviet world of chess, winning the 1977 USSR&nbsp;championship. &quot;But they had a problem with me, because of the worldwide support I received. In such a situation, they couldn't make me disappear, and so they made do with attempts to wear me down. Not a month passed without my being invited for a few days with KGB interrogators. I entered and left the interrogations regularly,&quot; he recalled in 2005.</p> \n<p>Boris and Anna Gulko are in some ways the king and queen of chess. They first met at a chess club in the Soviet Union some five decades ago, and Anna (born Anna Akhsharumova) also went on to be a grandmaster, winning two Soviet titles, in 1976 and 1984, and the U.S. championship in 1987.</p> \n<p>As he talks about his eventful life, Gulko also keeps an eye on the living room clock, making sure he has enough time to prepare before Shabbat arrives. Anna, meanwhile, is busy in the kitchen, cooking for Shabbat. They have been members of their local Orthodox shul for many years and both wear head coverings. It is a far cry from their formative years in the Soviet Union.</p> \n<p>Boris Gulko grew up in a secular home in the small town of Elektrougli, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) east of Moscow. “Communism and religion didn’t go together. In the Soviet Union, if you were religious you couldn’t be a member of the Communist Party or find a good job,” he recounts. His parents were both engineers, and while neither was particularly religious – the family didn’t celebrate Jewish holidays – Gulko describes them as people with “Jewish feelings.” He also remembers his father reading Torah stories to Boris’ sister.</p> \n<p>He first learned he was Jewish at age 3, when he says he “went outside and a group of kids attacked me and called me ‘Jew.’ When I came back home, I asked my parents what it meant and they told me I was Jewish. I wanted to know if there were any privileges that came with being a Jew, and was very upset to learn that I’m going to suffer from something I have no control over and that comes with no benefits,” he smiles.</p> \n<p>Born in 1947, Gulko says he vividly remembers the first time he realized the true nature of his homeland – a country that, more than 60 years on, he still describes as an empire of evil. “It was 1956, three years after [Joseph] Stalin’s death, and [Nikita] Khrushchev, the new leader of the Communist Party, sent a secret letter to all members of the party with information about the horrible crimes committed by Stalin.”</p> \n<p>Gulko’s father worked in a brick factory, which was where he and his fellow party members heard Khrushchev’s infamous letter. Boris recounts that when his father came home that evening, “he gathered the whole family around the dining room table and told us how Stalin murdered 40,000 officers before World War II. That’s why we lost 27 million people during the war, while Germany, which lost the war and fought against a coalition of armies, lost only 5.5 million. Because of Stalin, we entered the war with almost no officers. My father told us how Stalin murdered millions and millions of innocent people for no reason – decent Russian citizens,” Gulko says.</p> \n<p>After his father finished his talk to the family, he went to the kitchen, took the portrait of Stalin that was standing on top of the oven and proceeded to smash it on the floor. “It was broken into many small pieces,” Gulko recalls, eyes glowing as if the experience were only yesterday.</p> \n<p>Boris Gulko’s father never experienced life outside of the Soviet Union, but passed on his disdain for communism to his son. “Living in the Soviet Union, he didn’t know much about other ideologies such as capitalism, for example, but he knew life was horrible in the country – both materially and spiritually – so he figured there must be something better elsewhere,” says Boris Gulko. “But he was mostly busy working hard and trying to make a living.”</p> \n<p>If 1956 had opened the 9-year-old Gulko’s eyes to the harsh realities of life in his homeland, an even louder wake-up call arrived in the summer of 1968 – when he was already one of Russia’s top chess players. He says this when he first realized he could no longer live in a country that in many ways, as he describes it now, wasn’t much better than Nazi Germany.</p> \n<p>“I was 21 and playing an international tournament in [the former] Czechoslovakia,” he recounts. “Prior to that trip, I already knew I was living in a bad country – I just didn’t realize how bad we were.” Then, on the morning of August 21, he awoke in his room in Prague to the sound of bombing and jets flying overheard. He switched on the TV “and heard the news about the invasion led by Russia and its satellites. A few minutes later, some of the local chess players came to me and told me their country was occupied, that they were now under Russian control. For the first time, I truly realized I was living in a country of villains.”</p> \n<p>Gulko, who was studying psychology at Moscow University at the time, decided to share his feelings with his fellow students. It was a decision that would come back to haunt him nearly a decade later. “When I came back from Czechoslovakia, I gathered some friends and students and told them what I saw during the trip. I didn’t know back then that there was at least one KGB informer in each group of students,” he says.</p> \n<p>A hate-hate relationship</p> \n<p>As Gulko’s career as a chess player developed in the 1970s, his actions away from the chessboard were starting to make him a marked man. He appeared at a few events in support of Soviet dissidents, noting that because he was “already a famous chess player, the KGB agents recognized me right away.”</p> \n<p>But his first major falling-out with the Soviet authorities came in 1976 when another famous Russian player, Viktor Korchnoi, defected to the West after playing at a tournament in the Netherlands. As a result, Russia’s grandmasters were all ordered to sign a letter expressing their disgust at his actions.</p> \n<p>“Only four grandmasters refused to sign the letter,” Gulko recalls. “One of them [Boris Spassky] was living in France and had nothing to lose; another [Mikhail Botvinnik] had already retired many years before; one was David Bronstein, whose career was finished as a result of his refusal to sign; and the last one was me. It was a huge risk. In the Soviet Union, many times it wasn’t about what you did, but rather about what you refused to do. And after I didn’t sign the letter, I was suspended for a year and couldn’t compete at any tournament.”</p> \n<p>When he was finally allowed to compete again, in 1977, Gulko won the Soviet chess championship for the first time – only to realize he was still being punished for his actions.</p> \n<p>“I lived in a country that was officially anti-Semitic,” Gulko declares. “Because of that, and because they knew about my feelings toward the Communist Party, they decided not to send me to almost any important international chess tournaments. I mean, what’s the point in being the champion if you can’t play in big tournaments? You could say that, by then, I hated my country and my country hated me.”</p> \n<p>At the height of his success, and after appearing in the 1978 Chess Olympiad, Gulko decided it was time to leave the Soviet Union.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know I wanted to move to Israel,” he reflects. “But strangely enough, I submitted my papers to the immigration department on May 14,” the date marking Israel’s declaration of independence. “After that, I was forbidden from participating in all tournaments, not just internationally,” he adds. Gulko became one of the most famous refuseniks of the era, joining thousands of other Soviet Jews who were denied permission to emigrate from the country.</p> \n<p>Looking back, he describes this period of his life in numbers: Seven years as a refusenik; three hunger strikes; 24 days without food; and one month of demonstrations, in 1986, in one of Moscow’s main squares.</p> \n<p>It became a daily ritual: “Every day we were arrested and released after three hours – since the police weren’t allowed to hold anyone for more than three hours without explaining why,” Gulko says. “One night we were held for nine hours, so every three hours they moved us from one police station to another.”</p> \n<p>It was during his years as a refusenik that he became not only a Zionist but also discovered Judaism.</p> \n<p>“During our seven years as refuseniks, we read a lot of Zionist and Jewish literature,” says Gulko. “The refusenik community brought us lots of books about Israel and Judaism from the United States. For me, it was an opportunity to get some Jewish education for the first time in my life. And while this time was very bad for my career, I always say it was an important time for me spiritually. I even remember that during our month of demonstrations, we made sure not to protest on Shabbat,” he adds.</p> \n<p>Gulko’s religious observance became more pronounced in the United States – but it did not happen overnight. “When my son was 12, we sent him to live for a year with my sister in Jerusalem,” Boris Gulko recounts. “He went to a religious public school in Israel and when he returned said: ‘From now on, we eat only kosher food.’ For me it was a slow process. First I went with him to synagogue only on Friday night, but slowly I became more and more religious.”</p> \n<p>Years of denials</p> \n<p>Back in May 1986, after their month of protests and arrests, Boris and Anna were summoned to the government offices.</p> \n<p>“My wife was waiting for me outside while I was talking to the woman inside, who asked me to fill out some papers and come back again the following day,” Boris remembers. “I kept asking her why and if I was permitted to leave the country or not. But she didn’t tell me. She just kept asking me to go and come back again the following day. When I left her office, my wife – who was listening behind the closed door – told me the lady had said more than once that we were allowed to leave, but I didn’t hear her. After so many years of denials, I just refused to realize we were free to go.”</p> \n<p>Three days later, they were on a plane to Israel, unaware that just a few months later they would be on the move again, this time to the United States.</p> \n<p>In America, Boris Gulko was free to compete again, winning the U.S. championship twice. In between, he was named grandmaster-in-residence at Harvard University and enjoyed a winning record (3-1) against the legendary Kasparov.</p> \n<p>“The first time we played was in 1978 and it was a draw – a very difficult one for me. Already then he was a very strong player,” Boris Gulko says. “Three years later, in 1981, I beat him in the national championship. The second time I won was in 1982, when we played each other in the USSR team championship. The third and last time we played was in 1988, in an international tournament in Spain. By then he was already considered a genius, but I guess I wasn’t that bad a player myself.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>In her book “Fascism: A Warning,” former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presents criteria for assessing the fascist tendencies of leaders. “Do they cater to our prejudices ...? encourage us to have contempt for ... the electoral process? ... seek to destroy our faith in ... an independent press, and a professional judiciary? ... exploit the symbols of patriotism ... in a conscious effort to turn us against one another?”</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may not be a fascist, but his grades on Albright’s test are constantly rising. He has incited against the left and used it as a convenient scapegoat since entering politics, but his attacks have grown stronger and more lethal. He has always complained about a hostile media, but hitherto refrained from depicting it as an enemy of the nation; criticized the legal establishment, but did not seek to undermine it; claimed to have all the answers, but refrained from placing his personal fate above democracy and the rule of law.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s battle cry against the Israeli police in a Likud party gathering this week was a classic. I am the victim of a dark conspiracy, he implied. Don’t believe your eyes and ears, he told his avid fans. Ignore the evidence collected by police investigators and their findings, but believe my every word. “Nothing will come out of it because there’s nothing to it,” he reminded them, despite the clear-cut indications that he abused power, at the very least, and possibly committed serious crimes.</p> \n<p>That was enough for his scores of advocates, as well as hundreds of thousands of blind supporters, to disseminate his message as holy writ, as if in a cult.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s ploys succeed because he is not operating in a void. Israeli society may not be identical to others in which fascist regimes assumed power, but the similarities are disconcerting nevertheless. It has a dangerous fusion of religion and politics; a long-held resentment, carefully nurtured by Netanyahu and the right, against so-called elites and their liberal values; a sanctification of the nation and dismissal of all the rest and a sense of existential threat, not entirely unjustified, that trumps loyalty to democracy and the rule of law.</p> \n<p>The horrific crimes of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis have placed historical analogies to the Weimar Republic beyond the pale, at least in Israel. Nonetheless, as Benjamin Carter Hett reiterates in his recent book “The Death of Democracy: Hitler’s Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic,” Weimar was also marked by a unified right that faced a splintered left, a parliamentary democracy that was seen as corrupt and ineffective, a world that was perceived as hostile and unfair and a willingness to blame it all on a treacherous media, a weak judicial system and a worldwide conspiracy of cosmopolitan Jewish financiers — see George Soros — that was sapping the strength of the nation. In Weimar, too, the rational right bowed its head before its extremists, comforting itself with the false hope that this too shall pass.</p> \n<p>2018 Israel fortunately lacks the kind of complete catastrophe, utter failure or system collapse that propelled Weimar and other prefascist societies into the arms of strong, charismatic leaders who were freed from the constraints of law and democracy.</p> \n<p>It stands in the same line, however, with countries such as Russia, Poland, Hungary and, yes, the United States, in which hypernationalism and historic grievances have created a critical mass that disdains liberal democracy — and whose leaders Netanyahu views as his brothers in arms. It is these same countries that spurred Albright to issue her warning.</p> \n<p>“Fascism will not pass” was the famous cry of resistance issued in Valencia by Dolores Ibarruri, known as La Pasioniara, just before Gen. Francisco Franco’s troops captured Madrid and enslaved Spain to fascism for over a generation. Ibarruri relied on a “wall of bodies” to stop fascism — a task that Israel may now have entrusted to the attorney general, who will decide Netanyahu’s fate.</p>",

        "text":["<p>This week’s public lighting of a menorah outside a Pittsburgh synagogue where 11 people were killed in a mass shooting was an opportunity to honor the dead, mark Hanukkah’s theme of survival and allow the community to reinforce its solidarity.</p> \n<p>“To me, it’s a simple message: The light is the message,” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said, pointing to the menorah standing at the corner where a makeshift memorial for the 11 victims once stood and was visited by thousands paying their respects.</p> \n<p>Five weeks after the massacre — believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in the U.S. — about 500 people gathered outside Tree of Life to pray, sing songs and witness the lighting of the menorah.</p> \n<p>“We are practicing our Jewish faith publicly and proudly,” said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light, whose congregation, along with congregants from Dor Hadash and Tree of Life, had gathered at the synagogue when the shooting occurred Oct. 27.</p> \n<p>The fact that hundreds of people showed up for the ceremony came as no surprise to officials of the three congregations.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there are enough adjectives to describe the community support,” said Myers, who was leading Shabbat services at Tree of Life synagogue Oct. 27, when the shooting occurred.</p> \n<p>“We’re such a tight-knit community,” said Ilana Kohanbash, who attended the menorah lighting with her husband, Jason. “It’s also a wake-up call for what we need to do to keep our faith, and [that] we need to take precautions. It could happen to anybody.”</p> \n<p>The suspected shooter, Robert Bowers,&nbsp;raged against Jews during and after the shooting, authorities said. He remains jailed without bail, and has pleaded not guilty to numerous murder and hate crime charges.</p> \n<p>David Hausdorff, 53, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, was in town on business and came to the lighting ceremony to show support.</p> \n<p>“It’s unfathomable, this act of violence,” Hausdorff said. &quot;It’s unconscionable in any house of worship, let alone in a neighborhood I grew up in. If I weren’t here to actually see it, I wouldn’t grasp the totality of the emotional devastation.”</p> \n<p>The menorah lighting comes less than a week after the end of shloshim, a 30-day mourning period observed by Jews following a death.</p> \n<p>“We all begin the process of moving forward,” said Ellen Surloff, president of Dor Hadash. “You move forward one day at a time. You have good days and some not-so-good days.”</p> \n<p>Although the gunman targeted the Jewish community, Cohen cautioned that the shooting serves as a warning.</p> \n<p>“The reality is it affects other religious communities, too,” he said. “We are coming together in comradeship and to help to see if we can work together. What happened here, clearly this is a sign, this is a signal and it can’t be ignored.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>With three police recommendations that he be indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reached the point where anything he says or does will be viewed through the prism of his legal predicament and political survival. And now he is serving as prime minister, defense minister and foreign minister, that problem will only intensify.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu seemed fully aware of this on Tuesday night when he gave his statement on Operation Northern Shield&nbsp;at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. The leader who rarely gives credit to anyone else praised his cabinet colleagues, the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff and all its soldiers, and even the previous defense minister and now his bitter critic, Avigdor Lieberman. The message was clear: Contrary to the aspersions being cast during the day by the opposition that this was actually “Operation Netanyahu Shield,” designed to divert the public’s attention from cases 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000, there had been a professional and nonpolitical decision-making process.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot’s face said it all. He didn’t enjoy being part of the political show with the embattled prime minister. He didn’t even mention Netanyahu in his own short statement. Instead, he kept to the facts, giving the precise date when the decision to embark on the operation was made (November 7), and said that “it is taking place before the (Hezbollah) tunnels become operational.”</p> \n<p>But why was the decision announced at this particular moment?&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Attack tunnels from Lebanon: Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset &nbsp; A former IDF general who has worked extensively with both Netanyahu and Eisenkot said in the first hours of the operation that “Eisenkot wouldn’t have allowed himself to be part of a political operation. There are lots of operational parameters that determine the timing, and also non-operational ones. I can’t say whether Bibi as a politician didn’t have some of those parameters at the back of his mind. I don’t believe, however, that the operation is itself political, the IDF has been working on the Hezbollah tunnels for years and there was going to have to be a moment when it would come out into the open. The timing may be another matter.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When the IDF embarks on a major operation nowadays, there is always a media appendix to the operational plan. This is one of the main lessons of the trauma of the Mavi Marmara raid in 2010, when the footage that the naval commandos filmed while boarding the ferry was stuck in the pipeline for hours, while the only images in the media were those made and distributed by the Turkish activists. When Defense Minister Netanyahu authorized the plans for Operation Northern Shield, he would also have been presented with alternative PR strategies.</p> \n<p>Was it necessary to make such a media festival out of what is just another stage in an ongoing operation? Hezbollah could have been notified by any number of other channels that Israel was only operating on its side of the border.&nbsp;The mysterious flight on Monday to meet U.S. Secretary of State&nbsp;Mike Pompeo in Brussels didn’t have to be so public – and anyway, Israel has so many other ways of informing the Trump administration. As a journalist, one has to appreciate all this information being offered. But as a citizen, one can’t help asking whether this uncharacteristic military transparency is serving other interests.</p> \n<p>In some ways, Israel has never had a better PR machine, headed by the elder salesman of all times, Netanyahu. The various government communications departments have been expanded with an emphasis on social media, or as it’s being called in the Foreign Ministry, “digital diplomacy.”</p> \n<p>But government press officers complain of a lack of guidance and clear strategy, which they say derives from a vacuum at the top of the ministries. “Netanyahu is prime minister, defense minister and foreign minister, which basically means we have no foreign minister because that is the lowest priority,” says one long-suffering diplomat.</p> \n<p>Another issue that comes up in conversations with government PR experts is the lack of strategic thinking in the government’s media policy and how it has all been co-opted to Netanyahu’s personal agenda. This is also affecting the IDF spokesperson's unit, now under direct command of the new defense minister – Netanyahu.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even within the unit, there are officers who admit it has disproportionate influence on the national &quot;hasbara&quot; (public diplomacy) effort. The spokesperson's unit has 150 career officers, 400 conscripts and thousands of reservists at its disposal. No other PR department is in possession of such resources, and as its visual props it has an entire army of sexy combat soldiers, tanks and fighter jets. When the civilian press officers are demoralized and disillusioned, the military takes over.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu himself is surrounded by alumni from the unit. His official spokeswoman, Shir Cohen; his new media operators Topaz Luk and Yonatan Urichl; and his unofficial but most influential media adviser, his son Yair&nbsp;– all served as conscripts in the unit. It’s unclear whether the PM’s press office has been militarized or the IDF spokesperson's unit is being politicized. Either way, it’s an erosion of already blurred lines.</p> \n<p>The IDF is about to become the main prop in Netanyahu’s survival plan.</p>",

        "text":["<p>On May 24, Loudon Wainwright III recorded a Netflix special, “Surviving Twin,” at the El Portal Theater in North Hollywood. The date might be incidental to most people, but not to me and not to Bob Dylan. See, May 24 happens to be one of the only two things I have in common with Bob Dylan. Apart from both of us being Jewish, we share a birthday.</p> \n<p>How does LWIII (as he’s known to fans) come into the equation?</p> \n<p>Well, back in 1992 he wrote Dylan a birthday tribute song – “Talking New Bob Dylan” – in which he explained how his own career began in Dylan’s shadow and how, instead of having the confidence to perform his own material, he “won a whole lot of Bob Dylan imitation contests.”</p> \n<p>In typically self-denigrating fashion, Wainwright describes how record labels “were signin’ up guys with guitars” and looking for the new Bob Dylan. “We were new Bob Dylans,” he groans, in perfect Dylanesque, “your dumb ass kid brothers.”</p> \n<p>When I spoke to Wainwright by phone last week, he confessed that, while there are some years when he remembers that it’s Dylan’s birthday, he can’t recall whether he was aware of the significance of the date at the time of recording.</p> \n<p>“Ironically,” he added, “I’m going to see Bob Dylan perform tonight. He’s going to be performing tonight at the Beacon Theater here in Manhattan.”</p> \n<p>I confessed my envy.</p> \n<p>Whatever the circumstances of Wainwright’s career trajectory, the 72-year-old musician, actor and humorist has been entertaining audiences with his music and acting for 50 years. He released his first album in 1970 and has more than two dozen studio albums to his name, as well as television roles in “M*A*S*H” and “Community.” He also appeared and wrote the music for Judd Apatow’s “Knocked Up.”</p> \n<p>It was Apatow and Christopher Guest – a longtime friend and former “bandmate” in Spinal Tap (when it was just a TV sketch and not a seminal mockumentary) – who brought “Surviving Twin,” launched last month, to Netflix. Guest also directed the 90-minute special, and he and Apatow produced it.</p> \n<p>The show begins with Wainwright striding onto the stage, already playing his acoustic guitar. When the applause dies down, he launches into a raw, emotional version of the show’s title track.</p> \n<p>As he goes on to explain, “Surviving Twin” is a “posthumous collaboration” with his late father, Loudon Wainwright Jr., an acclaimed journalist whose career writing for Time magazine spanned four decades. Interspersed between Wainwright’s songs, almost all of which are about his relationship with his parents and/or children, he performs some of the hundreds of essays his father wrote.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t characterize my relationship with my Dad as being a close one,” Wainwright told me. “We were competitive and combative. When I was a young man, I pushed back – which was appropriate. But we weren’t close and I always felt bad about that.”</p> \n<p>With Freudian and Oedipal candor, Wainwright describes fighting his father for his mother’s affection; he confesses to wanting to hurt his father and asks, “Can a man’s son be his twin?”</p> \n<p>Wainwright’s father died in 1988 and, he says, the collaborative, posthumous effort “brought us closer.”</p> \n<p>Personal and honest</p> \n<p>“Close” is also not an adjective that Wainwright uses to describe his relationship with his four children – three of whom are successful recording artists in their own right: Rufus and Martha Wainwright, his children with Canadian folk singer-songwriter Kate McGarrigle, and Lucy Wainwright Roche, whose mother is singer Suzzy Roche.</p> \n<p>Wainwright’s songs are often uncomfortably personal and honest, but always witty and poignant. He sings with aching regret about the time he hit his daughter, wistfully and almost apologetically about his privileged upbringing in the country clubs of Westchester County. He might be best known for his novelty 1972 song “Dead Skunk (in the Middle of the Road),” but the B-side of that single (Google it, kids) was the sweetly plaintive “Needless to Say.”</p> \n<p>“When I began to write songs in the late ‘60s and early 1970s, they were autobiographical,” Wainwright says. “Then I segued into my unhappy marriage and my difficulties with young kids. When my father died, though, I was – in a sense – freed up to write about him in a different way.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, four years after his father’s death, Wainwright released an album called “History,” which he says is entirely about his father – and even includes a song that his father wrote. It also took him four years after his mother died to release “Last Man on Earth,” which included several songs about his mother.</p> \n<p>Those two albums form the backbone of “Surviving Twin.” But don’t be fooled by the heavily psychological elements of the show. Wainwright delivers his heart-rending lyrics with charm and humor. His performances of his father’s essays channel Garrison Keillor; they are delivered with the kind of warmth and affection that Wainwright did not share with his father during his lifetime.</p> \n<p>And “Surviving Twin” is also very funny. Wainwright says that when he told his grandmother what his first child was going to be called, she complained that “Rufus is a name for dog.” She was right, he jokes.</p> \n<p>Wainwright tells his audience (addressing them as “kids,” even though many look more like his peers than his offspring) that it’s important for children to tell their parents, “Fuck you!” His own children have had ample opportunity to say just that to their father. Carrying on a family tradition, Rufus and Martha have both written songs about their father; Martha’s “Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole” is, she has said, a response to her father’s way of writing songs about his family, rather than tending to them.</p> \n<p>What was it like, I asked him, to hear his own children tell him “Fuck you!” He laughs. “You mean: How does it feel to hear them still tell me that?”</p> \n<p>“It was a shock,” he says. “But thinking about it, it’s totally appropriate. My kids have all, in one way or another, told me to fuck myself.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>According to the utopian vision of Boris Schatz, the founding father of two iconic Jerusalem institutions – the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design and the Israel Museum – the city would one day also host an additional prestige venue: a “Garden of Love,” an official site for forbidden liaisons between men and women. It is “one of the greatest moral institutions we have created here,” Schatz wrote, “a solution of genius to the grave and saddening difficulties that humanity could not solve formerly,” Schatz wrote in his 1918 novella, “Jerusalem Rebuilt: A Daydream,” about life in Palestine as he imagined it would be a century later.</p> \n<p>Is it possible that early in the 20th century, long before the advent of the internet and the mobile phone, the father of Israeli art predicted Tinder-type dating? His idea bears more than a passing resemblance. In the Garden of Love, “one’s heart is not given to anyone. No one knows to whom he is giving his heart. Neither he nor she even knows the other’s name,” Schatz wrote in his vision. “The man and the woman meet there, do not get involved in a heartfelt relationship, but the one helps the other to get free of a natural need, to quiet the blood and the nerves, whose operation was amiss, because they could not fulfill natural law.”</p> \n<p>Schatz makes it clear that he is not referring to prostitution or other forms of sexual exploitation: “There is no place here for selling and buying people for mere pleasure, as occurred formerly. Both [participants] are free people. Both have come there to fulfill their natural need and they will help each other, out of the kindness of their heart, to achieve this.”</p> \n<p>In one sense, the sexual encounters in the Garden of Love in Jerusalem are the most sublime realization of love. “Because those involved don’t know each other, and possibly will never meet again, their love becomes pure, abstract: love for its own sake, without any ulterior motives, side issues, accounts to settle or extraneous influences,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>“Jerusalem Rebuilt” is “a very personal story, spawned by distress,” says the curator and art scholar Yigal Zalmona, a member of the Bezalel Academy faculty. Schatz, who was born in Lithuania in 1866, attended a yeshiva but left early to study sculpture and painting in Vilna, Warsaw and Paris. Subsequently, he established the Royal Academy of Art in Sofia, Bulgaria. In 1903, he met Theodor Herzl not long after Herzl published his utopian novel, “Altneuland” (The Old New Land), describing a visit to an imagined future Land of Israel. Their meeting converted Schatz to the Zionist cause.</p> \n<p>Inspired by the book, in 1906 Schatz founded the Bezalel School of Art and a national museum, forerunner of the Israel Museum, in Jerusalem. However, his professional advancement was curtailed by World War I. Toward the end of the conflict, Bezalel was shut down by the Turks and its founder deported to Damascus. “There, in a cockroach-ridden prison, he started to write the book,” Zalmona says. Writing in Yiddish, he completed the work in Tiberias and Safed, where he remained in forced exile from Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>However, Zalmona says, “Salvation was already on the horizon, because the British had arrived in the country.” Perhaps this was what allowed Schatz to transcend his personal difficulties and offer an elaborate and optimistic vision for the Land of Israel in 2018. Its hub was a modern, progressive, clean Jerusalem, very different from the city Schatz knew a century ago – but also not corresponding to today’s Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>“It’s very easy to dismiss the book as nonsense, and the nostalgia and amusement it arouses are also understandable,” Zalmona observes. The book will be the focal point of a conference at the Israel Museum and at Bezalel on December 9-10, titled “Boris Schatz: From Sofia to Jerusalem and Beyond 1918-2018.” In Zalmona’s view, the fact that the conference is a joint event of the Israel Museum and the Bezalel Academy shows that his vision was fulfilled, not confined to utopian realms.</p> \n<p>Still, Schatz’s vision transcended the world of art. In the novella (which is available online – in Hebrew translation – in a text version at the Project Ben Yehuda website and through the National Library site), the author falls asleep in 1918 and wakes up a hundred years later. He flies across the country’s skies accompanied by Bezalel Ben Uri, the chief artisan of the Tabernacle in the Book of Exodus, for whom the art academy is named.</p> \n<p>Enlightening holidays</p> \n<p>Between the lines, Schatz emerges as quite a deft futurist. For example, decades before homes in Israel had telephones, he predicted Skype-like conversation. “A beautiful woman with an infant in her arms… looked exactly like the cloth screen in the moving pictures,” he wrote about the display in the “telephone station,” one of many scattered around the city.</p> \n<p>Light in the holy city would be supplied by solar energy. “On the high towers are bent mirrors that concentrate the sun’s rays. The vast force that accumulates there will be worked into electric light,” Schatz wrote. Electric power will reach every house. “The steel wires that are attached to every house made me realize that electric power did away with the steam engines here.”</p> \n<p>Sophisticated public transportation would be diverse and free, with a genuine innovation: moving stairs. “Throughout we traveled from place to place by different means: by automobile, by moving sidewalk, by the cable route to the top of Mount Carmel, and from there we flew by airplane to Acre,” Schatz writes of his trip through the country. “We returned from Acre in an electric boat… There is no class system on the train – whoever arrives first gets a better seat. The carriages were extremely comfortable. The train moved, by means of electric power, at great speed and almost without any shaking. One could read a book at leisure, but I couldn’t pull myself away from the window.”</p> \n<p>The buildings and factories in Schatz’s utopia have central air conditioning. “And in the summer, ice shall be placed there to cool the air, and the climate can be easily adjusted as needed,” he writes.</p> \n<p>The economic organization of the utopia was socialist. For example, private property was abolished so strictly that people no longer invited guests to visit, because they had nothing to offer them. Social encounters were held in “popular meeting places, clubs and other public venues.” In former times, “guests would rob a person of his residence and his freedom, would spread the luxury, the ostentation, the unemployment, the slander, empty ceremonies and deception,” Schatz writes. At the same time, common dining rooms eliminate the need for home kitchens. In Schatz’s vision, food substitutes are developed in 2018 Israel. Thus, “people living in the next generation will not have to kill animals for food, will not have to work so hard to fill their stomachs and expend so much energy to maintain life.”</p> \n<p>Food will be supplanted by laboratory-manufactured “essences,” to provide “every person with all he needs for his natural subsistence along with the enjoyment of tastiness and a pleasing aroma.” Alcoholic beverages (without alcohol) and cigarettes (without nicotine) will be sold only in drugstores. “Desist from poisoning the people in order to augment the government’s revenues,” he writes.</p> \n<p>In Schatz’s utopia, every citizen is entitled to two months of vacation a year, in addition to Sabbaths and holidays. “On days off, the workers visit various exhibitions, take practical courses, attend lessons in the popular college, sit for examinations, participate in different congresses and in competitions of gymnastics societies. The vacation months bring no less benefit to the whole people than the working months.”</p> \n<p>Much of Schatz’s account of utopia is devoted to social changes involving the gender balance of forces. Throughout, and on this theme, too, a complex, contradiction-ridden picture emerges. On the one hand, “Women are no longer domestic cooks for the family… The wife has ceased to be a woman of the cooking pot… and has been liberated from the kitchen and its brain-addling habits,” Schatz notes.</p> \n<p>At the same time, women will be liberated from another burden as well: having to adorn themselves and dress up for men, and wear the latest fashion. “It is the way of the woman to beautify and decorate herself, seek to curry favor in the eyes of beholders, particularly if she is beautiful. Her nature has not changed even now, but her taste has improved, for the men have become more aesthetically-minded,” Schatz explains. “Now women have ceased to dress up in glittering objects… No longer will a woman look at a man in an effort to stir his passion, tickle his nerves.” For he would consider that to be unsavory, wild, unaesthetic. He seeks a woman’s natural beauty… Accordingly, the fashion seasons have now been cancelled.”</p> \n<p>No place for the weak</p> \n<p>In contrast to the men, who in this vision would do national service after their schooling, the women would be obliged to attend “Mother Israel,” an institution in which they would be taught how to be mothers. “A woman who is a good mother fulfills the most important duty for the benefit of the people,” Schatz avers. Still, not every woman is worthy to be a mother in Israel 2018. In this connection, a glaring disparity looms between the rosy future he depicts and the controversial ways he proposes to achieve it, some of which later graced Nazi and other benighted regimes.</p> \n<p>“Now children will be born only to the elect, whose blood is absolutely pure and who have attained perfection of body and mind,” Schatz writes, describing a breeding program that recalls Nazi eugenics, which aimed to ensure that only the racially “fit” would reproduce. (The eugenics movement was also active in Europe and the U.S. in the early 20th century.)</p> \n<p>“Not every person is duty-bound or wishes to create a new generation ‘in his form and image.’ That obligation devolves only on humanity’s elect, only those whom we would want all people to resemble,” Schatz writes. “In olden times, only the sick in body and mind refrained from endowing the world with children like them. This sexual abstinence was very useful in eradicating the diseases until they disappeared completely from the Earth. Afterward, weak, untalented and unseemly people also ceased to raise up seed.”</p> \n<p>In Schatz’s vision, peace and harmony prevail in Israel, even between Jews and Arabs. “True peace between us and our neighbors… We have reconciled with the Bedouin, too,” Schatz writes. Following World War I, “the Peace Congress decided to eliminate and destroy all the world’s weapons.” Accordingly, “With the help of the Great Powers the arms of the Bedouin were taken from them… Because they could not obtain new arms, they stopped living by the sword.” Indeed, in this utopia the Jews teach the Arabs civility to the point where “many of them converted to Judaism even though we did not make an effort to Judaize them and to bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence. We taught them only the laws of honesty and justice.”</p> \n<p>The major obstacle to peace has also been neutralized. The center of the country is the Third Temple, which Schatz envisions will be established by agreement between the Jews and the Arab minority, but will serve as a museum of art.</p> \n<p>The form of government is “a social democratic republic” led by the Sanhedrin, headed by a president, a spiritual leader who is elected for life. However, Schatz’s portrayal indicates that this is not a democracy of a kind familiar to us today, but an oligarchy of intellectual elites.</p> \n<p>Another institution in Schatz’s “daydream” is the “Valley of Ghosts,” which is “a place to die in.” It’s there that those who are about to die are sent. “Everyone who goes to the Valley of Ghosts is already considered dead in the eyes of all the living. He parts with his friends and relatives before going there.”</p> \n<p>Schatz himself died in 1932 in the United States, while on a fundraising campaign for Bezalel. He was 66. He hadn’t manage to get his book published until 1924, six years after it was written. He was forced to scrap a plan to publish additional sections of the novella and had to abandon his hope of making money from the sales of “Jerusalem Rebuilt.” Today, a century later, original copies are sold at high prices in auctions and by antiquarians.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The darker it is at Hanukkah&nbsp;– the more vicious, callous, dystopic this world gets&nbsp;– the more clearly I can see the face of my grandmother, who died when I was young, and who was an anarchist.</p> \n<p>She didn't like holidays. At all. Not American holidays, and not Jewish ones. But she liked Hanukkah. Hannukah, for some reason, was hers.</p> \n<p>You can see her in the picture of my graduation from Carpenter Avenue elementary school. She's sitting in the back, a dour and tiny woman, tough as nails, tough to like, already being killed by the cancer that would take her within the year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;How anti-femicide protest is uniting women in Israel's Arab and Jewish communities&nbsp;■ Editorial:&nbsp;A cry against contempt for women's lives</p> \n<p>Terrible things had happened in her life, and they were still there in her eyes, austere as stone. Except at Hanukkah. Her eyes softened, allowed us to see what she must have looked like when she was young. On Hanukkah, her eyes, I now recognize, took on light.</p> \n<p>Here was this woman who, years ahead of her time, did not believe in marriage, patriarchy, nationalism, religion, commercialism, or eating animals. She even named her only daughter Nora, from Ibsen's A Doll's House, hoping that she would think independently, and rebel.</p> \n<p>But there was something about Hanukkah that Grandma Ashi did believe in, something that she needed us to know, though we were too small at the time, and maybe too American, to hear it.</p> \n<p>Those eyes of hers, rekindled in the Hanukkah lights, saw something in the future which, only now, a grandparent myself, I am beginning to understand:</p> \n<p>There are times so dark, that the most radical act you can perform, is optimism.</p> \n<p>Hanukkah.</p> \n<p>Every night the candles are gone, burned down to nothing. And the next day there are more of them. And then there is more light than the day before. The light is stronger.</p> \n<p>Yes, it gets dark in between, my Grandma Ashi was trying to tell us. That's when you have to believe in the next day.</p> \n<p>The true miracle of Hanukkah is not that a pitcher of oil lasted for eight days. Nor that a small band of guerrillas once defeated a much larger army.&nbsp;Or that one group of Jews triumphed over another in a civil war. As my grandmother's own battles with her Orthodox parents showed, Jews have been at civil war with one another – whether over religion, culture, gender, politics - intellectually, at times violently, for thousands of years now.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No. The true miracle of Hanukkah is tikvat hinam, baseless optimism, hope without just cause.</p> \n<p>This very day, I am seeing the might and the wisdom in what my grandma was trying to get us to grasp.</p> \n<p>Today, women throughout Israel,&nbsp;women of many colors and cultures and creeds, are leading an unprecedented movement to seek for themselves what the government has proven itself unwilling to grant.</p> \n<p>Thousands of women, and men as well, are in the streets stopping traffic, massing at rallies, striking to push for a nationwide program to counter the plague of domestic violence against women, and the horrific murders of women by their husbands, ex-husbands, and boyfriends.</p> \n<p>These women are the embodiment of the Hanukkah song, &quot;Banu Hoshech L'Garesh,&quot; which begins, in translation, &quot;We have come to banish the darkness.&quot;</p> \n<p>In the next line, the song describes the essence of radical optimism: &quot;In our hands are light and fire.&quot;</p> \n<p>At the newspaper where I work, as in countless other sites across Israel, the staff poured into and blocked the street outside the front door for 24 minutes this morning – commemorating, in this small country, the deaths of 24 women murdered this year alone.</p> \n<p>A surprising number of the truck and taxi drivers who ply the busy street responded with support and patience. One who did not, though, left his car in an effort to bludgeon and curse the staff back inside.</p> \n<p>The invective poured out of him. Twenty-four straight minutes of it.</p> \n<p>Using Hebrew and Arabic alternately, he called the women sluts and whores. He used the word &quot;zevel&quot; - trash or feces - &nbsp;for everyone. And for the men who formed a barrier between him and women protesters, the raging man shifted to attacking their masculinity, calling them, to their face, men who are at once weak and homosexual, by using the word &quot;motzetz,&quot; a version of c---sucker.</p> \n<p>When his stream failed to move anyone, he tried, without success, to get other drivers to join him. In a discordant echo of the song, he shouted: &quot;L'Garesh otam!&quot; – &quot;banish them!&quot;</p> \n<p>That word again. L'Garesh. That small word laden with enormous emotional and political and interpersonal charge. That word which also means to cast out, to exile, to divorce, to deport.</p> \n<p>No one moved.</p> \n<p>My Grandma Ashi would have been proud.</p> \n<p>Those people in the streets, all over the country this Hanukkah - they are the light. The fire is inside them.</p> \n<p>Their hope, their optimism, their refusal to quit, is what will&nbsp; banish the darkness. They understand the radical humanity of their actions. To banish darkness, rather than people.</p> \n<p>Their eyes have adjusted to the darkness. Like my Grandma Ashi's.</p> \n<p>They are the miracle.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli army launched Operation Northern Shield on Tuesday to destroy Hezbollah attack tunnels crossing into Israel from Lebanon. The tunnels were found over the past several years, and according to the army, are part of Hezbollah’s “Conquest of the Galilee” plan.</p> \n<p>What is the tunnels’ purpose?</p> \n<p>Israel’s security services believe the tunnels were designed to permit Hezbollah to launch a surprise attack and penetrate into an Israeli town near one of the tunnel’s openings. The spokesman for the Israeli army, Ronen Manelis,&nbsp;said on Tuesday that Israeli forces “are working in the Metula area, and in the coming days, the operation will be expanded to other parts along the front.”</p> \n<p>How long will the operation last?</p> \n<p>Political sources have told Haaretz that it is expected to take “weeks.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Battle between Israel and Iran shifting from Syria to Lebanon | Analysis ■ Attack tunnels from Lebanon: Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset | Analysis</p> \n<p>Is there a connection between this operation and the decision to refrain from carrying out a military operation last month in the Gaza Strip?</p> \n<p>Yes. It can now be reported that the presence of the tunnels in the north were among the considerations in the security cabinet decision not to launch a full-scale operation&nbsp;in Gaza following last month’s&nbsp;botched Israeli military operation&nbsp;there and the firing of some 500&nbsp;rockets from Gaza at Israel. Most of the ministers agreed, in keeping with the defense establishment’s position, that an offensive in Gaza was not appropriate at the time, out of concern over an escalation on two fronts.</p> \n<p>That is what Prime Minister Netanyahu was referring to on a visit to Paris last month when he referred to security issues that he could not disclose. Avidgor Lieberman, who&nbsp;resigned his post as defense minister&nbsp;following the cease-fire announcement, disagreed with the assessment that the northern front required immediate action. He insisted that the situation in Gaza was more pressing. For their part, Habayit Hayehudi cabinet members Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked demanded a tough response in the future in Gaza.</p> \n<p>And what about the connection between Operation Northern Shield and Netanyahu’s decision not to move up the date of Knesset elections?</p> \n<p>Several cabinet ministers criticized Netanyahu on Tuesday for using classified information about the tunnels and the northern operation to justify putting off elections. As they saw it, the level of the threat did not justify a delay in dissolving the current narrow coalition of 61 members. Since Tuesday’s disclosure of the operation, most cabinet members have expressed support for the cease-fire decision in Gaza at the time. The Prime Minister’s Office instructed the ministers not to grant interviews over concern that it would complicate the situation with Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>Residents of the north have long complained about hearing digging noises, so why has the decision been made now to take action?</p> \n<p>Immediately following the 2006 Second Lebanon War, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah announced a plan to conquer the Galilee. Israeli defense officials understood that the plan would also include border tunnels through which Hezbollah terrorists would enter Israel. Army officials at the time said they had not found evidence of tunnels but the army decided to establish a special team to look for them. As a result, over the past two and a half years, the army has made preparations for the operation that began on Tuesday. Nevertheless, army spokesman Ronen Manelis said on Tuesday that “the locations where tunnels have been found don’t necessarily correspond to the locations where citizens complained” about hearing digging noises.</p> \n<p>What are the implications for the residents of the north?</p> \n<p>Israeli army officials have decided not to declare a special situation in the north, but situation assessments are being carried out all the time to assess Hezbollah’s response to Operation Northern Shield. At this stage, farmers have been told not to approach the border barrier and in the northern town of Safed, Mayor Shuki Ohana ordered that the city’s bomb shelters be inspected. At the same time, the Israeli army spokesman said that “the tunnels that have been found are not an immediate threat and are not ready” for use.</p> \n<p>What steps did the Israeli army take prior to Operation Northern Shield?</p> \n<p>In 2015, Israel announced the construction of a new border barrier on the northern border aimed at putting a stop to Hezbollah’s attack plan. As part of the project, Israel seemingly carried out work above ground, but it also inspected the situation under the ground with engineering technology and intelligence information that led to the conclusion that the tunnels exist.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When I was last in Israel, to attend the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, I was struck by how many challenges Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced and how he was dealing with them. In addition to the border clashes with Hamas, Syria and Lebanon, Netanyahu must confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the continuing impact of the U.S. decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem, the anticipated peace proposal being worked on in the White House, and the controversial basic law regarding Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, he made significant diplomatic progress in Africa, South America&nbsp;and Asia&nbsp; — and even among Sunni Arab neighbors who share a fear of a nuclear Iran.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is confronting these and more recent challenges – including domestic political ones – with his characteristic toughness, shrewdness and overriding concern for Israel’s security. Whether or not one agrees with Netanyahu’s politics, it is hard not to admire his efforts and results.</p> \n<p>What is quite remarkable is that he is doing all of this while facing several criminal investigations. The issue at the center of these investigations seem trivial against the background of the existential crises Israel is facing, especially from an increasingly unstable Iran, determined to acquire a nuclear arsenal.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu's hysterical response to bribery recommendations shows he senses noose tightening&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>The first probe, also known as case 1000, involves gifts of cigars and champagne Netanyahu received from close friends. Everyone acknowledges that friends are permitted to give wine and cigars to friends, even if the recipient is the prime minister. The accusation is that Netanyahu took too many such gifts and made too many favors in return. But how many are too many? The law doesn’t say. It’s a matter of degree. But matters of degree should not be the basis for criminal prosecutions. The law should be clear — even quantitatively clear&nbsp;— so that everyone can know where the line is and not cross it. Today in Israel there is no bright line when it comes to gifts from friends. Nor are there unambiguous precedents. It’s a matter of prosecutorial discretion. No one should be charged with a crime unless he has willfully crossed a bright line and plainly violated a serious criminal statute. To bring down a duly elected prime minister on the basis of an expansive and unprecedented application of a broad and expandable criminal statute endangers democracy. I strongly believe that the appropriate criteria for criminal prosecution have not been met in the cigar and champagne case against Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>The other investigations (dubbed 2000 and 4000) pose even greater dangers to democratic governance and civil liberties. The second probe includes conversations, recorded by a Netanyahu aide, between the prime minister and the publisher of an Israeli newspaper, while case 4000 focuses on Netanyahu's ties, when he was communications minister, to a telecoms mogul who controlled a major Israeli news site.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In both cases, the prime minister is essentially being investigated for allegedly trying to push the media – with long histories of attacking him and his family – to be fairer. The publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth, Arnon (Noni) Mozes, is being investigated for seeking the approval of legislation that would have curtailed his main competitor, Israel Hayom, a free daily backed by Sheldon Adelson. In the end, Netanyahu opposed the legislation, opting to go to early elections in 2014 rather than let it pass, and Mozes continued the criticism of him and his family.</p> \n<p>In case 4000, Netanyahu is being investigated for seeking fairer coverage from the Walla news site, in exchange for supporting regulatory decisions made by civil servants.</p> \n<p>So what we are left with is an exploration of motives: In the Yedioth case, did Mozes try to get the prime minister to support the legislation by promising to end or reduce the media attacks? Did Mozes believe that the prime minister would actually change his strong opposition to the legislation into strong support? Did Netanyahu really intend to change his opposition to support, or was he merely playing him, as politicians do? Did the prime minister actually believe that the publisher would change his long history of attacks into support? If Netanyahu believed he was doing something criminal by discussing these issues, why did he have his then chief of staff record the conversations in the Yedioth case and not erase the tapes?</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the Walla case, the questions are similar, involving speculation concerning the state of mind of the participants.</p> \n<p>These are the kinds of questions that should be left to writers and readers in deciding for whom to vote and to which media to subscribe. They are not the kinds of questions that prosecutors and police should be empowered to ask elected officials and media moguls as a part of a criminal investigation.</p> \n<p>The relationship between politics and the media – and between politicians and publishers – is too nuanced, subtle and complex to be subject to the heavy hand of criminal law.</p> \n<p>Many votes by politicians are designed, in part – whether consciously or unconsciously – to garner favorable coverage from the media and to achieve other self-serving results. In many cases, a piece published by a reporter, editor or publisher is also calculated to some degree to promote self-interest – whether economic, political or career-related. To empower prosecutors to probe these mixed motivations is to empower them to exercise undemocratic control over crucial institutions of democracy.</p> \n<p>Consider the proposed Israel Hayom law that is at the center of case 2000. More than 40 Knesset members supported the law, despite its obvious constitutional problems, about which I have written.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Did they all do so out of altruistic motives alone? Or did at least some of them allow the fear of negative or the prospect of positive coverage by Yedioth – the main beneficiary of the proposed law – to tip the scale in favor of their support? Should prosecutors and police be empowered to question under oath every member of the Knesset who supported the bill to probe his or her motives? Should they be empowered to question the journalists who subsequently published favorable reports about these supporters?</p> \n<p>This is the “parade of horrible” that may follow from the current investigations of the prime minister and the publishers.</p> \n<p>In the contemporary political climate, in which large media companies – whether it be Yedioth, Walla, The New York Times, Time-Warner, Bloomberg, Fox, Yahoo, Facebook or Google – do more than report the news, there will be more and more regulation of their activities by government.</p> \n<p>These media companies will seek to influence the political discourse that affects their bottom line, as they simultaneously report on it.</p> \n<p>In some instances, positive votes will be rewarded by positive coverage, negative votes by negative coverage. That is – and always has been and always will be – the nature of politics and its relationship to those institutions that report on it. “Scratch my back and I will scratch yours” is as Israeli as falafel and as American as apple pie.</p> \n<p>Voters and readers have the right, perhaps the power, to promote more visibility and accountability from those for whom they vote and whose news they read or view. But police and prosecutors should not intrude on this complex, messy and nuanced relationship between politics and the media, except in cases of clear and unambiguous financial corruption well beyond what is alleged in the current cases.</p> \n<p>So, let Netanyahu continue his important work. If Israelis don’t like what he is doing, they can vote against him. If they don’t like how particular newspapers or news sites are reporting, they can subscribe to different media. But to criminalize these political differences is to endanger democracy and freedom of the press.</p> \n<p>Alan M.

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Israel can't bomb Syria, or at least can't act freely as it did before the accidental downing of a Russian plane by Syrian missiles, the Lebanese front gets closer, a front that has been quiet for years. Moving the front from Syria to Lebanon, if that's indeed Israel’s intention, narrows its strategic objectives and positions them around Hezbollah – as opposed to the broader objectives of the war against Iran in Syria.</p> \n<p>Israel made clear in Syria, with the full backing of the United States, that it wouldn't let Iran gain a foothold along the border. It used its attacks to stop the transfer of weapons and equipment from Iran, through Syria, to Hezbollah, and conveyed a combative message to Tehran. Now Israel is restricted to diplomacy against Iran in Syria, and if Israel plans to t Hezbollah, it will have to do so in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>This turn of events was clearly alluded to by the U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, who in a briefing to the media last month said the departure of Iranian forces from Syria would come via diplomatic and political efforts; that is, not by force.</p> \n<p>Another message came from Jeffrey on Tuesday when, in a meeting with the ambassadors of France, Britain, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, he proposed no-fly zones for Syria like the ones in Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. This very suggestion could betray an American attempt to restrict not only Russia’s involvement – through the United Nations&nbsp;– but also Israel’s involvement. Jeffrey’s suggestion probably won't come to fruition, especially because of Moscow’s opposition, but it contains a clear hint to Israel as well.</p> \n<p>At the same time, it seems that reviving the fighting in Lebanon, as an alternative to Syria, is an undesirable scenario both for Israel and Hezbollah. For now, this scenario could only occur as a result of a mistake in the field such as a strike against Hezbollah fighters or unconstrained shooting by Hezbollah at Israeli engineering equipment at the border.</p> \n<p>In recent months, Hezbollah has had a hard time reaping the political capital it desires in its efforts to establish a government in Lebanon. Hezbollah wants at least 11 ministers in the cabinet so it can prevent decisions not to its liking.</p> \n<p>According to the Lebanese constitution, such major decisions like budgets, national projects or treaties require the support of two-thirds of the cabinet. So it's enough if one bloc has a majority of one-third plus one (11 of the 30 cabinet seats).</p> \n<p>To reach that number, Hezbollah needs one Sunni minister (it has already exhausted its quota of Shi’ite ministers) from the Sunni legislators who support the organization. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, a Sunni, is against this. Not only would his bloc lose a minister, he&nbsp; doesn't want to give Hezbollah the political power it covets.</p> \n<p>And as long as there's no new government, there's no one to make decisions, which has been the case since Lebanon's May elections.</p> \n<p>This political struggle is preoccupying Hezbollah at the moment, so it doesn't want to test its strength again against Israel in a violent clash now. Such a confrontation would force Hezbollah to breach the convenient balance of deterrence that it has forged since the 2006 Second Lebanon War.</p> \n<p>In Hezbollah’s view, this balance of deterrence has kept the peace on the border and let it grow stronger in southern Lebanon – and not only there. It has allowed Hezbollah almost unimpeded action in Syria, without fear that Israel would attack it in Lebanon in the meantime. It has also allowed Hezbollah to hold on to its political power, thanks to its ability to threaten that it can always get Israel to attack Lebanon if the group decides to act against its southern neighbor.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah assumes, or at least hopes, that Israel is also satisfied with the balance of deterrence and that it doesn't intend to strike. So far, neither Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah nor any of his deputies have released a statement on the Israeli army’s operation against the group's attack tunnels on the border with Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;| Explained</p> \n<p>It seems that as long as Israel is operating in its own territory and doesn't cross the border into Lebanon – on the ground – Hezbollah will continue its policy of shrugging its shoulders. The more serious threat lies in the possibility that Israel will attack the missile factories in Lebanon and force Hezbollah to respond.</p> \n<p>Israel has been trying to convey aggressive messages to Iran and Hezbollah through European countries and Russia, and to a lesser extent through the United States. The problem is that this pressure doesn't have an effective address.</p> \n<p>Israel can declare that it considers the Lebanese government responsible for developments, but with no government, there is no one to pressure Hezbollah. The United States can freeze the record-high assistance it gives the Lebanese army, but this would be a case of shooting itself in the foot.</p> \n<p>Russia, which wants peace and quiet in Lebanon, can theoretically demand that Iran rein in Hezbollah, but it needs Iran to promote the political process in Syria, just as Iran needs Russia to get around the American sanctions.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia, which has tried to spark a revolution in Lebanon, folded after the fiasco of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri’s resignation, and its leverage in Lebanon is very limited. At the same time, Israel is actually the most sensitive to international pressure, both from Russia and the United States, as well as from Egypt, which is working vigorously in Gaza and doesn't want to be dragged into a diplomatic fight in a conflict that doesn't threaten it.</p> \n<p>In this tense web of pressure, Israel needs insight and great caution when it tries to push the limits and test its options in Lebanon. This arena is no longer a Lebanese-Israeli brawl, it has the potential to lead to a broader conflict in which the world powers get involved.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tax chief opposes reduction in Israel’s capital gains tax</p> \n<p>Eran Yaakov, the head of the Israel Tax Authority, said Wednesday he is opposed to reducing the capital gains tax. “You have to decide whether you want to give preference to someone investing in the stock market over someone who works and pays a rate of 47% on his income,” Yaacov told a conference on taxation and the capital markets. “If we were in an environment where capital gains taxes were higher, it would be a different story.” He was responding to a call for lower capital gains tax by Science Minister Ofir Akunis, who said it would encourage more stock market investment. Yaacov pointed to figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing that Israel’s 25% capital gains tax is near the weighted average of 23% for member countries. Yaacov said he supported ending the 5,000 shekel ($1,340) a month exemption on taxes on income from apartment rentals, saying it encouraged tax evasion.

The last day of trading in SodaStream shares was Tuesday, and they were removed from TASE indexes Wednesday. SodaStream delivered impressive returns for investors, with its stock climbing nearly nine times in the three years of its TASE listing. SodaStream had marketed itself as a more environmentally friendly and healthier alterative to brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. That and PepsiCo’s desire to diversify out of its core brand led to the acquistion. “With its customizable options, SodaStream empowers consumers to personalize their preferred beverage in an environmentally friendly way and provides PepsiCo with a significant presence in the at-home marketplace,” PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said, marking completion of the acquisition. (Guy Erez)</p> \n<p>Matomy shares surge on proposed rescue plan</p> \n<p>Matomy shares soared Wednesday after the financially troubled digital-advertising firm unveiled a plan to convince bondholders not to seek immediate repayment of their debt. Under the offer, which will be put to a bondholder vote in the coming days, Matomy shareholders will inject $10 million into the company. Major shareholders, which include the French advertising firm Publicis and hold a 55% stake in the company, have agreed to contribute funds, Matomy said. In addition, Matomy will negotiate new terms for it to buy the 10% stake it doesn’t own in Team Internet, with the aim of reducing the price. For their part, bondholders will be asked to agree to a delayed repayment to as late as 2022. They will not be asked to write off any of their debt. Matomy shares finished 28% higher at 35 agorot (9 cents). (Michael Rochvarger)</p> \n<p>Pressed by investors, Rami Levy agrees to reduce his compensation</p> \n<p>Under pressure from institutional investors, Rami Levy, the founder and controlling shareholder of the publicly traded supermarket chain named after him, agreed Wednesday to take considerably less compensation over the next three years. Under the proposed terms, Levy – or more exactly his privately controlled management company – will be paid a share of the pretax profits on a sliding scale ranging from 0.67% to 2%, half the rate he sought. In addition, the combined rent the chain will pay his private companies for stores will not exceed 7% of the chain’s sales and marketing and management costs for the year, rather than 8%, Lower rates will prevail on rents for other properties like warehouses and logistics centers. A shareholder meeting to approve the new employment contract has been delayed by three days to December 12. Rami Levy shares ended down 0.05% at 189.50 shekels ($50.83).

The benchmark TA-35 index rose 0.35% to end at 1,637.51 points, while the TA-125 added almost 0.6% to 1,480.55, on turnover of 1.65 billion shekels ($440 million). Trading was heavier than usual as exchange-traded funds bought TA-35 and TA-125 component shares to make up for SodaStream’s delisting Wednesday. Among blue-chip gainers, Israel Chemicals rose 1.8% to end at 21.59 shekels and Nice climbed 1.3% to 437. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries dropped 1.7% to 78. Bank shares were mostly lower, paced by losses of 1.2% to 24.29 for Leumi and 1.1% to 24.675 for Hapoalim. Bezeq group shares continued to slide, with Bezeq ending down 1.5% at 4.01 and B Communications losing 2.8% to 28.39. Ham-Let led TA-125 stocks higher, adding 4.6% to 76.30. Opko Health dropped 4.5% to 13.50. In foreign currency trading, the euro slid nearly 0.55% to a representative rate of 4.2289 shekels. (TheMarker Staff)</p>",

        "text":["<p>In memory of Yossi Sarid</p> \n<p>With the announcement of the police recommendation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted for bribery, the spectacle of coalition members prostrating themselves was to be expected. Their abject self-degradation for the sake of another temporary shred of power came as no surprise. Still, it was a depressing circus to watch, a stark example of the depth of the rot that has spread in Israel during the decade of Netanyahu’s rule.</p> \n<p>Other prime ministers never asserted like Netanyahu did that public trust in the police is “not at an all-time high,” nor did they rush to impugn an organization for which they bear direct responsibility. But such distractions are all that the prime minister has left. The evidence is much harder to deal with.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;To survive three bribery cases, Netanyahu may push Israel's democracy to the brink | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;What's at stake for Netanyahu after police recommend bribery charges | Explained&nbsp;■&nbsp;The seven deadly sins shared by right-wing politicians in Israel and the U.S. | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Case 4000 alone, the police have recordings and WhatsApp messages between Netanyahu and Shaul Elovitch’s people, the testimony of two former Netanyahu associates turned state witnesses, the testimony of the Walla website CEO and countless testimonies from the site’s employees about huge regulatory benefits given to Bezeq and Elovitch. To counter all of this, Netanyahu pulled out an opinion piece in Globes (which the former communications minister claimed was “research”) and an “investigative report” on the right-wing Mida website. Only by a stroke of good fortune were we spared testimony from Sheldon Adelson as a character witness.</p> \n<p>No business in the country would keep an employee with such a preponderance of evidence arrayed against him, even if he swore that the New Israel Fund and the police chief were conspiring against him. But this is our situation right now, thanks to the 61 members of the coalition. This is all that remains of Israel’s 34th government: Netanyahu and the dwarfs.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s corruption is moral rot that threatens to infect the entire body public if we don’t cut it off. The rot is spreading and hurting everything around it. It has turned coalition MKs into total doormats. One after the other, they are dispatched to make media appearances and explain why it’s so easy for them to live with corruption. The rot is hurting Walla employees, it’s hurting the taxpayer whose money went to the benefits that Elovitch got, and it’s hurting the public that is exposed to propaganda in the guise of news.</p> \n<p>In Case 1000, Netanyahu is accused of granting government benefits in exchange for a regular supply of cigars, jewelry and clothing. In Case 2000 and Case 4000, Netanyahu aimed higher, straight at the heart of Israeli democracy. The media is one of democracy’s guardians and Netanyahu used his position to turn media outlets into another Pravda, just a government mouthpiece.</p> \n<p>It’s been five days since police submitted their recommendations. Netanyahu is counting on the public’s attention deficit. He knows it won’t be long before something else comes along to divert it. But our prime minister is a suspect in three separate bribery cases, and if we let this pass it means our government’s rot has reached the citizens too, and that we no longer have any expectations of our government. These are Third World norms that we should not abide.</p> \n<p>This week marked three years since the death of Yossi Sarid. What he said upon his retirement from political life is still apt today: “I am leaving politics in the same shirt in which I entered it,” he said. “No stain has adhered to it. No blemish has adhered to it. If someone were to present my shirt to my father and ask, ‘Is this your son’s cloak?’ he would recognize it and say, ‘It surely belongs to my son.’ And he would greatly appreciate the fact that his son did not stain the shirt.”</p> \n<p>Unlike Yossi Sarid, Netanyahu has not only stained his shirt, he has stained the shirts of the 61 MKs who volunteered to serve as his flak jacket. Some are proud, worthy and smart people, but all are now stained, all are his partners in crime.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Three years ago, Don Was walked into a Jewish service in Los Angeles without high expectations. Was, born Don Fagenson in Detroit, is a producer who has worked with musicians like John Mayer, Bob Dylan and Bonnie Raitt. Since 2012, he has also been the president of Blue Note Records, the historic and acclaimed jazz record label.</p> \n<p>Since his bar mitzvah in 1965, he has rarely stepped into a synagogue.</p> \n<p>But his aging father, who was getting remarried, was set to be honored by his beloved egalitarian congregation and wanted his son to be there. He also wanted him to see the congregation’s live band, which played at its monthly service.</p> \n<p>The congregation, named Nashuva (or “We will return” in Hebrew), is the creation of Naomi Levy, a Conservative rabbi who was among the first women ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary in the mid-1980s. The 10-person band, which has mostly stayed the same over the congregation’s 14-year lifespan, is a diverse amalgam of cultures and musical traditions, boasting Filipinos, Ethiopian Jews and other Jews and non-Jews from the local community. Levy isn’t a musician by trade, but she sings in the band and helps write the melodies.</p> \n<p>Was was quite impressed by the band’s music at the service and approached Levy afterward, telling her that she should record its sound. They became friends and, six months later, Levy and the band found themselves in the famous Apogee Studios in Santa Monica, California.</p> \n<p>“I was pretty knocked out by the fact that she took these profound prayers and transferred them in a way that everybody in the room could relate to, and it was a very uplifting evening,” Was told JTA over the phone from Los Angeles.</p> \n<p>The result of the Apogee session was “Heaven on Earth: Songs of the Soul,” an album released earlier this month that puts 13 Jewish prayers to a mix of African-inspired world music beats and calming folk melodies. Was and Rolling Stones recording engineer Krish Sharma assisted in the recording, which was mixed by Grammy Award winner Ed Cherney.</p> \n<p>In the studio, each song took at most two takes, a testament to how practiced the musicians were. Was invited congregants to lend their voices and fill out the sound, and at times the studio was so full that they had to sit on the floor.</p> \n<p>Was, speaking just after completing a lengthy U.S. tour as part of a band backing Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, compared the effects of the music played by Levy’s band with what Weir evokes. He described the feelings that Weir would produce when playing the Dead’s classic song “Ripple” during encores — Was could see members of the audience crying and hugging.</p> \n<p>“I thought Naomi was doing the same things with these prayers that had been around forever,” Was said. “She made them resonant in a really relevant way, which is not a small feat.”</p> \n<p>The Nashuva band’s music is full of big, catchy melodies, which Levy said is part of the congregation’s larger goal of attracting unaffiliated Jews who don’t realize they are yearning for spiritual fulfillment. When Levy worked previously as a rabbi at a Conservative synagogue in Venice Beach, she’d see many stragglers poke their heads in to Saturday morning services but leave after a few minutes.</p> \n<p>“I found myself more and more drawn to the Jewish outsider, I wanted to learn what they were about and how to reach them,” she said. “They haven’t found God or a soulful experience in synagogue. They find it in yoga class or at their zen center, but they haven’t found it in Judaism.”</p> \n<p>Now Nashuva, which relies on volunteer help and grassroots donations, draws about 400 people at the monthly services and streams High Holiday programs to 70,000 around the globe.</p> \n<p>Was’ father, Bill Fagenson, who died earlier this year, was among Nashuva’s biggest fans. Was said his father became less interested in Judaism as Was grew up, but Nashuva’s message spoke to him, and he had a late-in-life return to the fold.</p> \n<p>Thus Was post-bar mitzvah wasn’t exposed to much of any Jewish life. But he received a great musical education growing up in the ‘60s near Detroit, which attracted all kinds of musical legacies thanks to its car plants. Workers from all backgrounds migrated up to work in the factories and brought their favorite genres with them — from blues to jazz to country western.</p> \n<p>In 1979, Was and his friend David Weiss — a fellow secular Jew — formed Was (Not Was), a quirky band that melded pop, funk and rock and experienced some album chart success by the late ‘80s. He built a producing r&eacute;sum&eacute; at the same time, and by 1994 won the Grammy for producer of the year. (He has won three other Grammys and produced albums by artists ranging from the Rolling Stones to Neil Diamond to former One Direction pop star Niall Horan.)</p> \n<p>Was hasn’t exactly returned to religion the same way his father did, but he attends a Nashuva service when he has time in his busy schedule and happens to be in L.A.</p> \n<p>“She created a great vibe,” he said of Levy. “And it’s what you try to do with all music, really, is to improve the quality of the listener’s life, help them understand something about life.”</p>",

But on Monday the minister was questioned by the Israel Hayom newspaper, which referred to Al-Quds as “a supporter of terror.” Katz got cold feet, and announced he was withdrawing the recognition of the university’s graduates. “I will not give recognition to an institution that supports terror,” he said, as he ordered the certification of hundreds of social workers frozen.</p> \n<p>Al-Quds University, based in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and its alumni have been battling the authorities for a decade to get recognition of its graduates’ professional training. The refusal is always based on political, rather than professional considerations. Government officials have in the past said that such recognition would undermine Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem. Thus, while graduates of other universities in the territories are recognized by Israeli regulators, it is the graduates of Al-Quds, most of whom are Jerusalem residents, who must search for work in other places, rather than where they live.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>After a lengthy battle, attorney Shlomo Lecker, representing the university, obtained recognition of its medical school graduates by the Health Ministry, a move that has helped relieve the shortage of doctors in East Jerusalem. Subsequently the degrees of paramedical professionals were also recognized. Only the social workers remain.</p> \n<p>A year ago, following requests by the university, Deputy Attorney General Raz Nizri instructed the ministry to consider recognizing the university’s social work graduates. The Jerusalem Social Services Department supported the move. Recently, the professionals in the Social Services Ministry who examined the university’s curriculum agreed that its hundreds of graduates should be recognized so as to relieve the distress in East Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The decision reached the minister’s desk and he signed off on it. But then came the inquiry by Israel Hayom and Katz proved that the Likud primaries and catering to the right were more important to him than the fates of battered women, the emotionally scarred, the elderly and the disabled, all of whom need the services of social workers.</p> \n<p>Katz – who is suspected of a series of crimes, including bribery, fraud and breach of trust – has joined other ministers, like Culture Minister Miri Regev and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, in sacrificing the professional concerns of their ministries on the altars of populism and kowtowing to right-wing voters. He has done wrong by East Jerusalem social workers and the people who need them.</p> \n<p>Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit will soon be asked to give his opinion of Katz’s behavior.

They believe that a liberal-left cabal is hunting Trump and Netanyahu, each in their own way. The majority, one assumes - or at least hopes - isn’t that gullible. Their fault is far worse: they are cowards. They keep their mouths shut. They swore allegiance to their countries, but it is a mere trifle compared to their loyalty to their careers.</p> \n<p>They fear their party's leader. They are terrified by the wrath of his base. They know what happened to colleagues who dared defy their chieftain. So they play along, they dodge and weave, they step out in front when they can defend him and avoid the limelight when they can’t.But when the time comes for their re-elections, they will present themselves to the public as profiles in courage.</p> \n<p>2. Stupidity: Seriously, there are lawmakers and many local politicians in the United States who actually believe that there is a “Deep State,” that sinister globalists are pulling the strings, that the intelligence community is infested with traitors, that Trump is being hounded by malevolent prosecutors and that most of what the mainstream media reports is fake news concocted for the express purpose of deposing Trump and destroying the patriotic right.</p> \n<p>Likewise in Israel, there are legislators and a multitude of Likud activists and supporters who believe that it’s okay to take lavish gifts from billionaires with interests, that everyone is corrupt so why is Netanyahu being singled out, that the media is part of a conspiracy, the police are bent on framing the prime minister, the legal system is biased and George Soros and the New Israel Fund are pulling all their strings.</p> \n<p>Their denseness is not their fault. Nonetheless, one is always surprised by the large numbers of dolts who manage to make it to the highest offices in the land, but perhaps it’s okay: Any liberal who supports commensurate representation for all groups in society cannot fault the idiots for demanding their fair share. And in light of the first deadly sin of their craven colleagues, it’s only natural that the cowardly recede into the background while the stupid take center stage and dominate the airwaves.</p> \n<p>3. Hypocrisy:&nbsp;What if it was Barack Obama, as the hackneyed clich&eacute; goes, who kowtowed to Putin, bent over backwards for the Saudi Crown Prince, disrupted relations with trusted allies, insulted the intelligence community, undercut the legal authorities, was surrounded by aides prone to dismissal, perjury and prosecution, was making a mint off the presidency and was mired in a potential conspiracy with the Kremlin to sway the elections? What if it was a Democratic president who was running up a monster deficit, disrupting free trade and calling himself “Mr. Tariffs”? Who else but Mitch McConnell could kill one Supreme Court appointment by shelving it for over a year and then blast the Democrats without batting an eyelid for briefly delaying the appointment of another?</p> \n<p>And what if it was Ehud Barak or Shimon Peres or any other prime minister not from the right who had a rich track record of soliciting gifts from wealthy friends while in office and who persisted despite knowing full well that it was improper, at the very least? What if it was a Labor prime minister who had been accused by the police in three separate cases of taking bribes and who reacted not by defending himself but by lambasting his investigators?</p> \n<p>For that matter, what if it was Barak or Peres who had refrained from retaliating for 450 Hamas rockets? One thing’s for sure: Netanyahu would have accused them of cowardice and capitulation if not outright collaboration, and his minions would utter the explicit word he meant to say but didn’t: Treason.</p> \n<p>Black or white, right or wrong, good or bad, smart or silly – it’s all in the eye of the beholder. There is no truth, belief or moral value, only posture, expediency and loyalty to the tribe. Of men and women like these Hanna Arendt noted: “Only crime and the criminal, it is true, confront us with the perplexity of radical evil; but only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.”</p> \n<p>4. Fear mongering and rabble rousing: Right wingers thrive on fear. A world without fear scares them. In a world without fear, politicians are expected to improve society, a task that bores some right wingers and strikes dread in others. After all, right wingers, up to and including Trump and Netanyahu, are in thrall of big money, if not actually in its pocket, and big money is happy with the current state of affairs, which is where they made their bucks in the first place.</p> \n<p>So they stoke fear for its own sake. If there’s a real threat they will magnify it and if there’s no threat on the horizon, they will invent it. From rapist immigrants to terrorist Muslims, from evil Arabs to treacherous lefties, there’s never a shortage of candidates for the role of bogeyman. For right wingers to survive, they must conjure fear and incite to hate. A world in which people are empathetic and understanding toward each other despite their differences is one in which an average right winger can’t be elected dogcatcher.</p> \n<p>And the bogeymen serve a dual purpose: Before the elections, they are the instruments used to rouse the rabble. After the elections they are the convenient scapegoat for all the broken policies the right invariably carries out and all the broken promises that no one had any intention of keeping in the first place.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel's Iron Dome defense of Saudi Arabia aims to avert collapse of Trump and Netanyahu's entire Middle East strategy | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israelis’ post-Pittsburgh sefense of Trump isn’t just realpolitik: They just don’t get it | Analysis</p> \n<p>5. Racism: Not all of them are, of course. But it is nonetheless the underlying theme of their existence. Republicans can come up with specific rationales for voter suppression, state rights, cutting welfare, opposing Obama and believing he was born in Kenya, but everyone knows, including themselves, what it’s all about: Maintaining white privilege and suppressing minorities, especially African Americans. This has been true of the GOP ever since Richard Nixon adopted the so-called “Southern Strategy,” but Trump released the party from the need to pretend otherwise.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Likudniks and other right wingers can elaborate into the night on why the nation-state law does not denigrate non-Jewish minorities, why Arab towns are underfunded, why they are systematically deprived of building permits, why East Jerusalem looks like a garbage dump, why it’s logical for Palestinians to live under military rule for over half a century, why its forgivable for Netanyahu to cry,&nbsp;“The Arabs are coming, the Arabs are coming” on election day and why it's still acceptable to accuse Jewish centrists and leftists of collaborating with the Arabs just because they happen to think otherwise.</p> \n<p>Their supporters, however, read their right-wing representatives loud and clear: Jew good, Arab bad. And how dare you accuse us of racism?</p> \n<p>6. Sexism: The leader of the Israeli opposition is a woman, Tzipi Livni. The leader of Meretz to her left is a woman, Tamar Zandberg. Of the 16 ministers in the Likud cabinet, on the other hand, there are only two women and both hold minor portfolios, even though Culture Minister Miri Regev makes noise in the media as if she were defense minister at least.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence of course. Israeli right wingers, like their counterparts throughout the democratic world, represent a conservative worldview that is inherently suspicious of women’s liberation. They are proponents of get-tough, take-no-prisoners policies marked by machismo. They may pay lip service to equality, but only as much as they need to, so as not to lose the women’s vote. And they willingly collaborate with ultra-Orthodox politicians, all male, whose views on women were last popular in the Western world in the mid 19th century.</p> \n<p>But Israeli politicians, to their credit, are flaming feminists compared to Republicans, whose imperious views on women were evident in the withering gazes of the majority in the Senate Judiciary Committee as Christine Blasey Ford testified against Supreme Court nominee, as he was then, Brett Kavanaugh. If Israeli right wingers disdain women, their American counterparts think they own them, lock, stock and barrel, including their reproductive organs.</p> \n<p>Never mind the abusive and misogynist man who lives in the White House that they salute and praise, as if “grab ‘em by the pussy” was just a bad dream or a completely acceptable point of order.</p> \n<p>7. Denial I – Climate Change: This one is truly a deadly sin. The scientific community is convinced that man-made global warming is beginning to torch the earth, but the rabid right thinks it’s all a plot to impose unnecessary regulation on business and industry. California is burning, the American southeast is looking forward to monster hurricanes, the seas are rising along with the temperatures and our grandchildren will live in a world that is the precursor to the novel Dune, but Trump and his minions are having none of it. It’s all a Chinese hoax, the president believes, fiddling as the earth starts to burn.</p> \n<p>How dare they? It’s quite simple: Most Republicans know they won’t be around to deal with the consequences of their criminal withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, their evisceration of the EPA and their removal of government imposed controls on manufacturers. So they eat, drink and make merry, because tomorrow they die, way before the earth goes up in flames.</p> \n<p>Denial II – the West Bank (and Gaza): This is the potentially deadly sin of the Israeli right. They don’t believe in peace, don’t believe in reconciliation, and don’t believe in dividing the land. They don’t really believe in the alternative of annexation either, because they would have done something about it in their forty years in power. They adhere to the status quo, and the believers among them are confident that God will know how to fix things properly.</p> \n<p>Their attitude towards the demographic threat seen by most researchers is the same as the Republican attitude towards climate change: It’s hokum, at best, and a leftist plot aimed at compelling Israel to give up its holy land, at worst. And what will happen when the situation becomes untenable and Israel is forced to choose between apartheid and a bi-national state? That day will never come, and if it does, by then the earth will be cooking itself to extinction anyway.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel and Hungary are holding talks on the content of a controversial Holocaust museum, the House of Fates, scheduled to open in Budapest next year.</p> \n<p>The opening of the museum, which was initiated and funded by the Hungarian government, is to mark the 75th anniversary of the Nazis’ deportations of Hungarian Jewry with the cooperation of the Hungarian authorities, which led to the murders of half a million people.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;It wasn't Nazi Germany that sealed European Jews' fate | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Representatives of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban are scheduled to meet Thursday with senior Israeli officials from the national security staff in the Prime Minister’s Office, rather than with the Foreign Ministry officials responsible for the issue. The arrival of the Hungarian delegation was first reported by Channel 10 News.</p> \n<p>The museum is causing conflicts within the Hungarian Jewish community, which fears that it will serve as a political tool to distort Hungary’s true historic role in the Holocaust. While the funding for the museum is coming from the government, the museum’s owner is the United Hungarian Jewish Congregation, known as EMIH, a small group headed by Chabad Rabbi Shlomo Koves.</p> \n<p>One of the museum’s biggest critics is the president of the large and long-established Hungarian Jewish Federation, Andras Heisler, who is in Israel this week for unrelated reasons. He and his colleagues fear that the museum might gloss over or minimize Hungary’s involvement in the Holocaust, distort history and be exploited by the right-wing nationalist Hungarian government. Israel’s Foreign Ministry, which has been excluded from the talks, has a similar concern.</p> \n<p>The Prime Minister’s Office said, “The Hungarians want to create a consensus regarding the museum’s narrative as a condition for its opening. […] Israel and other bodies involved in the issue are awaiting the Hungarians’ updated approach in an effort to achieve the desired consensus.”</p> \n<p>Supporters of the Hungarian government note that Orban has recognized his country’s role in the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust and does not whitewash the issue. Last year, at the end of his meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Budapest, Orban said he recognized his country’s crimes against Jews during the Holocaust and stressed that his government would protect Hungary’s Jewish community and fight anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“We have a difficult history behind us. Previous Hungarian governments committed errors and even sins when they did not defend their Jewish citizens [...] The Hungarian government did not take this position during World War II and instead of defending the Jewish citizens it cooperated with the Nazis, and this was a sin,” Orban said.</p> \n<p>But the concerns of those who oppose the museum intensified after the controversial joint statement on the Holocaust signed by Netanyahu and his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki, last summer. That was an effort by the two to end a diplomatic crisis surrounding the Polish Holocaust law, which threatened to imprison anyone who accused the Polish people of culpability in the Holocaust. But the agreement was heavily criticized by leading historians and by Yad Vashem, which said the agreement adopted the Polish narrative, which minimizes the role of the Poles in Nazi crimes and magnifies their role in saving Jews, to the point of “historical distortions” that “contradict the existing and accepted historical knowledge in this field.”</p>",

Arizona Cardinals quarterback Josh Rosen grew up with kids who made fun of the size of his nose.</p> \n<p>New England Patriots receiver Julian Edelman has heard anti-Semitic taunts during games, but he had been willing to write them off as opposing fans “just trying to get underneath your skin.”</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>“You’ve been called stuff here and here,” Edelman said. “But nothing to the extent where it’s got me feeling the way a lot of Jews are feeling right now.”</p> \n<p>In the month since a massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killed 11 and injured six others, Jewish athletes said they were shocked by the shooting yet not concerned for their own safety as they travel, train and compete.</p> \n<p>“There’s crazy people out there, and it is what it is,” Casspi said. “The notion is that anti-Semitism is dead – it’s always going to be (around). Some people are just like that. There’s going to be racist people, there’s going to be anti-Semites.”</p> \n<p>Robert Bowers has pleaded not guilty to murder and hate crime charges in the October 27 shooting during Shabbat morning services. He remains jailed without bail.</p> \n<p>Americans of all religions have rallied in support for the victims of the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. Hometown quarterback Ben Roethlisberger wore cleats integrating a Jewish star into the Steelers logo, along with the words “Stronger than Hate.”</p> \n<p>But for Jewish athletes, the shooting hit especially hard.</p> \n<p>“I’m horrified by it,” said Los Angeles Angels manager Brad Ausmus, who managed the Israeli team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. “Just the callousness and the loss of life. It takes someone that’s unhuman to do something like that to innocent people.”</p> \n<p>Jews in the United States have long cherished role models like Detroit Tigers slugger Hank Greenberg, Chicago Bears quarterback Sid Luckman or Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz. And any history of Jewish athletes includes the time Dodgers ace Sandy Koufax refused to pitch in the World Series because it conflicted with the holiday of Yom Kippur.</p> \n<p>Other Jewish players remain scattered throughout sports – a point of pride for fellow Jews but also a potential target for anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes people don’t even think they’re being racist but they might be a little offensive,” Rosen said.</p> \n<p>Casspi said he has always felt safe in the U.S., but while playing in Europe his Israeli team at times encountered violent protesters or played with no fans in the arena out of safety concerns.</p> \n<p>Athletes speak often of worrying only about things within their control; as far as game preparation goes, racism and religious bigotry qualify as distractions. And so Edelman’s inclination was to “keep your head down” and not let it bother him.</p> \n<p>“A lot of guys have got to deal with a lot of stuff when it comes to name calling,” he said. “You get so wrapped up in football and your assignment that you brush stuff off and don’t let it get to you. ... You take the high road, and you go from there.”</p> \n<p>But after the synagogue shooting, Edelman decided it was time to go public.</p> \n<p>Following the Patriots November 4 victory over the Green Bay Packers, he wore an Israeli baseball cap for his postgame interviews as a shoutout to those in Pittsburgh.</p> \n<p>“It’s disgusting what happened. And I’m just backing them up,” he said in a follow-up interview. “I’m proud of who I am and what I am. Just to let these victims know: ‘We’re all with you. This is a very tough time for you. I can’t even imagine. But you have support.’</p> \n<p>“It’s not like one of those things where you’re gonna put your head under the ground and kind of hide,” he said. “You’re gonna say, ‘Hey, that’s what makes us stronger.’”</p> \n<p>Rosen has also embraced his Judaism, developing a celebration dance called “The Hebrew Hammer” in the hopes that he can be a role model for Jewish fans and also a leader in a locker room that includes a variety of races and religions.</p> \n<p>“You can identify with any leader or role model you want. I’m just trying to be a good one,” he said. “It [Judaism] is a part of me that I’m proud of, culturally.”</p> \n<p>Ausmus said many of the Jewish baseball players feel a kinship, some of it from being part of a minority in the sport and some from playing together in the World Baseball Classic. This “has kind of fostered that feeling of connection,” he said.</p> \n<p>“They’re spread throughout ... 25 different organizations, they come together,” Ausmus said. “Every four years, you make that connection based on your heritage.”</p> \n<p>A three-time Golden Glove catcher who went to Dartmouth and played 18 years for four major league clubs, Ausmus said he wasn’t particularly religious when growing up with a Jewish mother and Protestant father.</p> \n<p>The only time he experienced anti-Semitism as a major leaguer was when a fan shouted things at a teammate.</p> \n<p>The thing is: the teammate wasn’t even Jewish.</p> \n<p>“His last name sounded Jewish,” Ausmus said. “So the fan was ignorant in a couple different areas.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>If there has been a concrete accomplishment in Israel from the #MeToo movement, it has been the demonstration of solidarity and caring that Israeli women have shown in their demand that the government mount a real battle against gender violence. Women shed their usual passivity and took to the streets Tuesday as a group, overcoming embarrassment and advocating for change.</p> \n<p>It was like the period in the United States when women fought for their rights, like places and times in which masses of women demanded and obtained the right to vote and equal civil rights, in a way that had never happened before in Israel.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Israeli army operation couldn't hold back outrage over government inaction on violence against women&nbsp;|■ A cry against contempt for women’s lives&nbsp; ■&nbsp;How anti-femicide protest is uniting women in Israel's Arab and Jewish communities</p> \n<p>One of the main reasons for the sorry and worsening situation of Israeli women in many spheres has been their lack of solidarity. In general, Israeli women define themselves based on their national, religious or communal affiliations but not based on gender. Research shows that Israeli women consistently define themselves first and foremost as Mizrahi or ultra-Orthodox or as from the periphery, while their identity as women is characterized as secondary to other self-definitions.</p> \n<p>Israeli women see communal issues, the need for reconciliation or national unity among various population sectors, or national security issues, or economic change, or a host of other issues as taking precedence over women’s needs and interests. As a result, it is only a handful of committed, “professional” feminists who are usually the ones to speak out against harm to women and in support of their rights. And “ordinary” women, even if they are social activists, act to further social causes that do not involve gender. For example, the Four Mothers movement of the late 1990s advocated on behalf of an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, and the organization Women in Black campaigns against the occupation of the West Bank.</p> \n<p>The mass, popular mobilization of Israeli women from all of the country’s population groups and regions to protest growing gender violence constitutes a dramatic break from the usual pattern. This week, ordinary Israeli women chose to define themselves as women and as such demanded that the state and government authorities protect women from gender violence. It’s too early to know if this broadly based protest marks the beginning of a new trend or if it will fade and be forgotten as a result of the disclosure this week that Hezbollah in Lebanon has dug tunnels under the Israeli border.</p> \n<p>But even at this point, one thing can be said: Ordinary Israeli women are no longer shy about defining themselves as women and of demanding their rights as such. Women have taken to the streets and have expressed solidarity with “their sisters” – women from every population sector, age and status, who have fallen victim to male violence.</p> \n<p>So let’s take advantage of this moment of grace to dream big – about what is to come, over growing and ongoing solidarity among women, solidarity that burst forth over the most severe and frightening type of violence of all, the cutting short of women’s lives. But it would also pave the way for an effective, mass effort on the other kinds of gender violence, which are more difficult to identify, more “embarrassing” to focus on or more complicated to unite around.</p> \n<p>The first of these efforts must be a war on violence against female sex workers – the most vulnerable women in society, who suffer horrendous violence. They are sisters and they are most in need of our women’s solidarity.</p> \n<p>For some years now, a broad coalition of organizations has endeavored to enact a law that would make the purchase of sexual services from a sex worker a crime. Thanks to the governing coalition’s commitment to this bill, a professional committee in the Justice Ministry adopted the coalition’s position and recommended the criminalization of the consumption of prostitution services.</p> \n<p>Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, however, in her typical bullying fashion, neutered the draft law, replacing it with one making the consumption of a sex worker’s services an administrative offense only, not a crime, carrying a fine of 1,500 shekels ($400). On November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I called Shaked’s action a legislative crime against women. We should channel our female solidarity into fighting it and demand a criminal law whose provisions will protect female sex workers and the dignity of all women.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Prof. Yaffa Zilbershats, who heads the Council for Higher Education in Israel, are advancing violence against women in the public sphere, by excluding women from many areas of campus life. This too must be fought, together, with female solidarity. We must also wage war against the institutionalized, forced application of discriminatory and humiliating patriarchal laws by the country’s religious courts, both Jewish and Muslim. All women must focus their solidarity against this systematic oppression, which has been with us throughout the history of the state.</p> \n<p>And as long as we’re dreaming, why not dream about a women’s political party? A party we can be proud to vote for, that will fight for our rights – but also for the rights of all. A women’s party for social justice. It could be headed by a female Knesset member who has consistently demonstrated the greatest diligence and devotion to the struggles for women’s rights and human rights in general: Merav Michaeli. Her deputy could be another impressive women, who fights not only against the exclusion of women from the public sphere but also for the rule of law and for civil courage: Dina Zilber, the deputy attorney general for legislative affairs. Why shouldn’t our votes make her the justice minister?</p> \n<p>It’s sweet to dream about solidarity. And if many women join the dream, it will become reality. As we know, every great act begins with a dream.</p>",

While polls show most American Jews vote Democratic and a majority are at least ambivalent about the settlements, American supporters of the settlements represent an influential minority that welcomes the president’s hawkish Israel policies.</p> \n<p>While there were lots of plaudits for both the Jewish state and the U.S. president during the evening, Hegseth began his speech by dissing Pelosi, the Democratic lawmaker from California who will retake the job as speaker of the House of Representatives she held from 2007 to 2011 — the only woman to do so.</p> \n<p>“We have a new Speaker of the House coming up in January here in the States. Her name is Nancy Pelosi,” Hegseth said, yielding boos from the room. “Yuli, any chance we can recruit you to be our Speaker of the House? I got a thumbs up. We have a chance — it would be an upgrade.”</p> \n<p>A self-described “Baptist Christian boy from Minnesota,” Hegseth also spoke about his connection to Bet El and “the faith of the Judeo-Christian values that we all believe in and we all invest in.”</p> \n<p>“That’s why I am so committed to this cause, to the cause of the Jewish people, to the cause of the land of Israel,” he said. “So honored to be here tonight, so thank you very much. It will never change, and thank God we have a president of the United States who feels the same way.” Zeldin, too, lauded Trump.</p> \n<p>“Now we are able to celebrate that our embassy has moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I was honored to be there. It wouldn’t have happened without President Donald Trump,” he said to applause.</p> \n<p>Edelstein spent less time on U.S. politics, instead heaping praise on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and speaking about his support of Israeli settlement building.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Netanyahu’s formula is doubly dangerous in an Israel prone to fascism | Opinion</p> \n<p>“Independence, sovereignty, will eventually come to Judea and Samaria and many more houses with be built in order to reach the number we all dream — a million Jews in Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical names for the West Bank that are favored by those on the right.</p> \n<p>Smith called on the audience to help him in his work to combat anti-Semitism, which includes co-chairing a bipartisan task force on the issue.</p> \n<p>Last year, the congressman introduced the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act to upgrade the role of the State Department’s global anti-Semitism envoy. The House passed the bill in September, but it has not come up for a vote in the Senate.</p> \n<p>“With your help, HR 1911 could easily pass this week,” Smith said of the legislation.” We’ve got to get the leadership in the U.S. Senate to just bring it up.”</p> \n<p>Jewish organizations have called on the Trump administration to fill the envoy role, which is mandated by law, but it remains vacant.</p> \n<p>As the event drew to a close, Zeldin noted the political divide among American Jews. He lamented the fact that out of 32 Jews currently serving in Congress, as well as the 37 in the incoming class, only two — he and Rep. David Kustoff of Tennessee — are Republicans.</p> \n<p>“When Pete mentioned that I was one of two Jewish Republicans, you were not sure whether or not to clap to that because what I was hoping [since last year’s gala] is that I would be able to talk about how our numbers have grown,” he said. “There are still just two Jewish Republican members of Congress, so we have to work on that maybe for a couple years down the road.”</p>",

We are aware of the entire project and we will attack them all in the coming weeks,&quot; the officer said, referring to the operation the military launched Tuesday against Lebanon's Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>The Israeli military launched&nbsp;an operation on Tuesday&nbsp;to destroy Hezbollah attack tunnels crossing into Israel from Lebanon. The tunnels were found over the past several years, and according to the army, are part of Hezbollah’s “Conquest of the Galilee” plan, to take place at the launch of a war against Israel.</p> \n<p>According to military estimates, Hezbollah was planning on using the tunnels during a war in order to smuggle small forces into Israeli territory so that they could ambush IDF convoys and hurt civilians. &quot;The forces that were meant to come out on the other end of the tunnel were supposed to aid the rest of the Hezbollah forces to enter Israel overground,&quot; an officer involved in the tunnel demolition operation said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu's meeting with Pompeo is a warning to Iran and Lebanon - before Israel takes military action&nbsp;■&nbsp;Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights&nbsp;■&nbsp;Battle between Israel and Iran shifting from Syria to Lebanon</p> \n<p>The officer added that the military used non-lethal weapons - a stun grenade - against the Hezbollah operative seen in a video released by the IDF &quot;carrying a bomb&quot; in order &quot;to prevent escalation.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister&nbsp;Benjamin Netanyahu&nbsp;said on Tuesday evening that the Israeli military's operation to&nbsp;destroy cross-border tunnels constructed by Hezbollah&nbsp;&quot;will continue until all its objectives are reached.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;This is not a limited operation, it is a broad and ongoing operation,&quot; Netanyahu said. He added that Hezbollah's intention was to infiltrate into Israeli territory, with the single purpose &quot;to attack and murder innocent Israeli men, women and children.&quot;&nbsp;The prime minister added that the tunnels are &quot;part of a broader regional operation led by Iran.&quot;</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, the premier said: &quot;Whoever tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,&quot; adding that Israel &quot;is operating divisively and responsibly on all fronts simultaneously. We will continue with further actions – public and clandestine – in order to safeguard the security of Israel.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The military said it has been aware since 2006 that Hezbollah was trying to construct attack tunnels stretching from Lebanon into Israel at several points along the border. Since then,&nbsp;Hezbollah&nbsp;chief Hassan Nasrallah has spoken of a plan to take over parts of the Galilee, in northern Israel, in a future conflict.</p> \n<p>Military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot said that the Israeli army possesses the plans for Hezbollah's &quot;defensive measures and residents of the north can feel safe. We spoke to regional council and municipality heads before the operation began. I told them to continue as usual.&quot;</p> \n<p>Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Beri said&nbsp;in a meeting with U.N. peacekeepers on Wednesday that Israel provided no evidence of&nbsp;cross-border attack tunnels.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;This (Israeli accusation) is not based on any real facts at all,&quot; Ali Bazzi, a lawmaker from Beri's parliamentary bloc cited the speaker as saying after a meeting.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>rime Minister Benjamin&nbsp;Netanyahu met U.S. Secretary of State&nbsp;Mike Pompeo&nbsp;in Brussels, Belgium on Monday. The two discussed ways to &quot;work together to block Iranian agression in the region - in&nbsp;Syria,&nbsp;Iraq, and&nbsp;Lebanon.&quot; The heads of the Mossad and the National Security Council, as well as Netanyahu's military secretary, also attended the meeting.</p>",

At a rally the night before the incident, protesters carried torches and chanted anti-Semitic slogans.</p> \n<p>Heather Heyer was killed after Fields drove his car into her and other counterprotesters, badly injuring others.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Judge Richard Moore allowed prosecutors to show the jury a cellphone text message exchange between Fields and his mother the day before Fields traveled to Charlottesville.</p> \n<p>&quot;I got the weekend off,&quot; Fields wrote to his mother. &quot;I'll be able to go to the rally.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;Be careful,&quot; his mother replied.</p> \n<p>&quot;We're not the one who need to be careful,&quot; Field wrote. He also attached an image of Adolf Hitler.</p> \n<p>Moore told the jury they would have to weigh whether the exchange and the image of the Nazi leader showed that Fields had premeditated intent.</p> \n<p>Attorneys for Fields called Paul Critzer, a Charlottesville Sheriff’s Department deputy, along with three other law enforcement officers, to the stand on Tuesday afternoon. Critzer testified that he talked to Fields after stopping his Dodge Charger and telling him to throw his keys out of the window. “He seemed calm in tone. He said, 'I’m so sorry,'” Critzer said, adding that Fields bolted away from him after initially putting his hands out of the window of his car as if he was going to surrender.</p> \n<p>The judge said the defense will call seven or eight witnesses on Wednesday and one witness on Thursday. The jury may get the case on Thursday, he said.&nbsp;</p>",

Hezbollah is not Hamas, not only in terms of its strength and armaments – which we talk about a lot – but first and foremost in its degree of justification.</p> \n<p>Hamas is fighting for a just objective – freedom for Gaza and liberty for the Palestinians. Israel cannot judge or criticize the means Hamas is using because Israel itself is committing far more serious crimes and abuses. When Hamas fires rockets, it is calling out in despair. It’s the only means it has available to remind Israel and the world of the disaster in Gaza.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;A Hezbollah blitzkrieg: Tunnels on Israel-Lebanon border reveal attack plan | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels&nbsp;■&nbsp;Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If Hamas would sit quietly and not fire, Gaza would be forgotten. If Gaza is forgotten, its inhabitants will perish. If Hamas doesn’t threaten Israel with force, the “by force alone” state will continue the siege forever.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah, by contrast, is operating from a sovereign and flourishing state. Hezbollah and Hamas are both extreme religious organizations, and not just “terror groups,” as Israel calls them, but Hezbollah is not Hamas.</p> \n<p>I would like to ask Nasrallah what he wants. Israel says he wants to destroy Israel. Israel says that about all the Arabs, but in this case it appears to be correct. Nasrallah says so himself. But since he is portrayed as a serious and intelligent leader, I would like to ask him if he really thinks this goal is legitimate, and if it’s practical. Meanwhile, he is causing damage to the Palestinians’ justified struggle, even though he claims to be defending them, and is liable to bring disaster on his own country.</p> \n<p>Shaba Farms, the murder of Imad Mughniyeh and the destruction of the Dahiyeh neighborhood in Beirut are not sufficient grounds for digging attack tunnels into Israel. Hamas’ tunnels lead out of a cage, but Hezbollah’s tunnels were dug from a sovereign nation with recognized borders.</p> \n<p>When Hezbollah was fighting against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, it was justified. Even when it opposes Israel’s arrogant flights over Lebanon, and of course its bombings, Hezbollah’s struggle is justified. The organization is also permitted to eternally recall Israel’s actions against Lebanon. But if its struggle is aimed at achieving the Palestinian people’s liberation, it isn’t likely to work.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah’s treatment of the most miserable Palestinian refugees, those in the camps in its own country, does not reflect much sympathy for them. Its threats to Israel achieve the opposite; they play into the hands of the Palestinians’ enemies. You see, says the Israeli right – in Lebanon there is no occupation, no siege, no territorial claims, Hezbollah is not made up of descendants of refugees expelled by Israel, and yet Israel is being threatened.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah has no grounds or justification for threatening Israel, nor does it have any chance of destroying the Jewish state. By threatening Israel it is undermining those who have the right and the obligation to battle it and those who express solidarity with the Palestinian people. The tunnels in the north serve the Israeli propagandists, who insist that all the Arabs want to throw the Jews into the sea, and that it doesn’t matter what Israel does, it will be under threat forever. The tunnels strengthen Israeli paranoia and self-righteousness, which doesn’t serve either the Palestinian people or justice.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah is giving Israel excuses for arming itself to the hilt, and for inciting its residents to hate Arabs even more and to lose faith in a diplomatic solution; it is also giving the West, and in particular the United States, another pretext for supporting Israel blindly.</p> \n<p>I would like to meet Nasrallah and tell him that solidarity with the Palestinian people and a struggle against Israeli apartheid are exceedingly just objectives. A pan-Arab struggle for equal rights in a single democratic state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is also a worthy struggle, in which Hezbollah can and even must participate. But tunnels that threaten the Galilee and another war with Lebanon are the wrong moves in the wrong direction.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Recently, I paid a successful visit to Israel and participated in the 3rd Annual Conference on Israel’s China Policy. I was deeply impressed by the interests of Israeli experts and pundits in following and studying China’s foreign policy. I would like to take this opportunity to share with Israeli friends some of my views on the current international situation and China’s vision on how to make the world’s future a better one.</p> \n<p>The world is now experiencing significant changes unseen in a century. On one hand, the interests of all the countries are increasingly interconnected. People from all over the world prefer peace to war, and cooperation to confrontation. On the other hand, the Cold War mentality, power politics, unilateralism and protectionism continue to linger; regional turbulence, terrorism, climate change and refugee flows remain unresolved challenges; problems caused by economic and financial risks and the widening development gap have become more acute. All these have brought about tougher global challenges in all fields.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;How close to China is too close for Israel?&nbsp;| Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Against the backdrop of these changes, tireless efforts have been made to explore good ways for ensuring world peace and development. China believes that countries need to commit themselves to global peace and common development, and work together to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, and to build a community with a shared future for mankind.</p> \n<p>To achieve lasting world peace, all countries should respect each other, discuss issues as equals, resolutely reject the Cold War mentality and power politics and take the new approach of communication and partnership, rather than confrontation and alliance, in developing state-to-state relations.</p> \n<p>To ensure universal security, every country should stay committed to settling disputes through dialogue and resolving differences through discussion, coordinate responses to traditional and nontraditional threats and oppose terrorism in all its forms.</p> \n<p>To promote common prosperity, we should promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.</p> \n<p>To ensure greater openness and inclusiveness, we should respect the diversity of civilizations, and replace estrangement with exchanges, clashes with mutual learning and superiority with coexistence in handling relations among civilizations.</p> \n<p>To make the world a clean and more beautiful place, we should take good care of environment, cooperate to tackle climate change and protect our planet for the sake of human survival.</p> \n<p>To build a community with a shared future for mankind is a historical process. It cannot be accomplished at one stroke, nor can it be plain sailing. It requires long-term efforts. The road is tortuous, the future is bright and the key lies in action. China is committed to building a new type of international relations. China will stay true to the mission of upholding world peace and to the path of peaceful development, continue to uphold peaceful development and cooperation for win-win results, and stick to an independent foreign policy. China will never seek hegemony or expansion.</p> \n<p>China is committed to building a network of global partnerships and expands the convergence of interests with other countries. China is promoting coordination and cooperation with other major countries and work to build a framework for major country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development. China continues to deepen relations with its neighbors in accordance with the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendship and partnership with its neighbors. China is guided by the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests and the principle of sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith, working to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries.</p> \n<p>China continues to push forward the Belt and Road Initiative under the commitment to achieving shared benefits through extensive consultation and joint contribution. China is strengthening policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people connectivity to build Belt and Road into a road of peace, a road of prosperity, a road of opening up, a road of innovation and a road connecting different civilizations and to play the symphony of the Belt and Road cooperation with the international community.</p> \n<p>China is taking an active part in reforming and developing the global governance system. The global governance reform that China seeks is not about overturning the current system and starting all over again. Instead, it is about improving the system so that it can better reflect the changing realities. China, as a staunch supporter of the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, is working to bring greater democracy in international relations under the principle of equity and justice and to continue to play the role of a responsible big country and to contribute China’s wisdom and strength to the reform and development of the global governance system.</p> \n<p>The joint efforts of the international community are essential for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. The whole world needs to work hand in hand to enhance friendly exchanges and mutual understanding. As nations with a long history of civilization, China and Israel have always appreciated, learned from, and communicated with each other, which laid the foundation of our friendship. In recent years, exchanges and cooperation between China and Israel have been expanding and new progress has been made in bilateral relations. We hope that the two sides will work together to push the Innovative Comprehensive Partnership between the two countries to a new level.</p> \n<p>Zha Peixin, a former deputy director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee, Chinese ambassador to Canada and to the United Kingdom, is a member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.</p>",

Total public sector debt, which includes, for example, local governments’ debt, was 60.9%.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years ago, the figure was 100%, and in the middle of the 1980s it was 180%. The ratio has been declining since 2004, with a short break during the global economic crisis. If the figure doesn’t fall this year, it will be the first time since 2009.</p> \n<p>In August, the Bank of Israel warned that, barring any surprises, total debt would probably increase to 61% this year from the bank’s estimate of 60.4% for 2017.</p> \n<p>In shekel terms, debt has grown 50% in the past 15 years, but this isn’t an unusually big increase and by itself no reason to worry. Israel’s economy grew even faster in those years.</p> \n<p>What’s worrying is that this year economic growth and debt growth may be growing at the same pace. The real rate of GDP growth in 2018 is expected to be about 3.5%, according to most economists – though the treasury measures nominal growth when it looks at debt.</p> \n<p>Israel’s declining debt has helped boost its credit rating, reducing borrowing costs and thus letting the government spend on other programs, whether education, health or defense.</p> \n<p>Concerns about the deficit have taken on added resonance in recent weeks after the Finance Ministry said that in the 12 months through October the deficit had grown to 3.6% of GDP, far above the 2018 target of 2.9%.</p> \n<p>That marks a sea change from recent years when the deficit came in under target, mainly due to one-time tax windfalls that boosted collections above what the treasury had forecast.</p> \n<p>The debt ratio was also lowered by a strong shekel, which made the government’s foreign currency obligations less expensive in shekel terms. More recently the shekel has weakened against the dollar. Only about 14% of Israeli debt was foreign debt as of the second quarter, but because of the weaker shekel this number rose sharply from just 11.5% at the end of 2017.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the treasury updated the figures for November, and they showed little change. The deficit improved but to just 3.5% of GDP. An official said the treasury was still confident that the total for all of 2018 would fall to between 3% and 3.2%, “unless something catastrophic happens.”</p> \n<p>“The deviation from the target of 2.9% won’t be significant when you’re talking about a budget of 400 billion shekels a year,” said a senior official who asked not to be named. “The deviation will be very marginal.”</p> \n<p>In any case, even if 2018 ends well, 2019 is expected to be more challenging. GDP isn’t expected to grow significantly faster, but the budget deficit is expected to widen. The combination of slower growth and a growing deficit will increase the debt-to-GDP ratio unless the finance minister acts by cutting spending and/or raising taxes.</p> \n<p>In a response to TheMarker, the treasury sought to downplay the impact of economic growth on the debt ratio. “The size of debt-to-GDP is very much influenced by market factors including the inflation rate and the exchange rate at the end of the year,” it said.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When the first U.S. real estate companies started coming to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange a decade ago to issue debt, it looked like a win-win for everyone. The companies, most of them focused on the New York market, could borrow more cheaply than in the United States, and Israeli investors could get a piece of a hot property market.</p> \n<p>But recent months have seen Israeli investors turn sour on the American companies, and this week the feeling was downright poisonous.</p> \n<p>The TASE’s Tel-Bond Global index, which groups the 35 foreign property companies, has fallen 10% this year, an exceptionally steep drop for a bond index. This week alone the index has shed 2.4% even after posting a gain on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Of the 27 billion shekels ($7.2 billion) in bond debt the companies have raised, some 10 billion of it is trading at junk yields of 10% or more. Another 4 billion is trading at between 6% and 9%.</p> \n<p>“It seems the capital market has lost faith in the American bonds and anyone who can is trying to dispose of them indiscriminately,” said one institutional investment manager who asked not to be named. “The big test will come when it’s time to make repayments; then we’ll see who can keep their heads above water.”</p> \n<p>The latest blow emerged this week amid renewed concerns about corporate governance at the real estate companies.</p> \n<p>All Year Holdings, which has raised 2.4 billion shekels in four bond issues, said that in the second quarter the company had inadvertently transferred $3.7 million to an entity controlled by controlling shareholder Yoel Goldman.</p> \n<p>Goldman returned the money, All Year said, but the affair left investors wondering about corporate governance in the sector.</p> \n<p>That worry was compounded by the fact that a similar incident occurred at Chosen Properties, where $2.5 million was accidentally transferred to controlling shareholder Moshe Orlinsky. Chosen has since said its board has adopted safeguards to ensure that an incident like that won’t happen again.</p> \n<p>But the problems of the U.S. real estate companies have been building for some time. A surfeit of new issues in the first half of this year tested the market’s appetite to the limit. Mutual funds, which are big holders of the bonds, have suffered redemptions from their investors, forcing them to cash out of their holdings, often at any cost.</p> \n<p>Short sellers have taken advantage of the segment’s woes and pushed bond prices lower. As of last week the value of shorts on foreign bonds was 516 million shekels, versus 400 million a month earlier and 300 million in August.</p> \n<p>Yishay Sasson, senior analyst for real estate at Discount Brokerage, said investors’ chief concern is that the companies, many of which are registered in the British Virgin Islands, won’t be able to roll over their debt in the new era of rising interest rates.</p> \n<p>“The business model of real estate companies – not just Americans – is based on rolling over debt by redeeming older bonds and issuing new ones,” he said. “The fear that has surfaced in recent weeks is that with the prevailing high bond yields, BVI companies won’t be able to raise new capital.”</p> \n<p>Sasson said that at the same time, high borrowing costs in the United States would reduce companies’ cash flow and make it harder for them to meet repayments.</p> \n<p>Brookland Upreal announced two weeks ago that it wouldn’t be able to make repayment on 150 million shekels in bond debt and asked bondholders to negotiate a new payment schedule. The company blamed cash-flow problems arising from slower-than-expected sales in its Brooklyn real estate market.</p> \n<p>Another company, Extell, announced that it was redeeming half its Series Aleph bonds, paying back 525 million shekels in principal and another 25.7 million this week rather than rolling over the debt. It moved up repayment to December 3 from the end of the year.</p> \n<p>It was the first time an American property company opted for repayment.</p> \n<p>Extell bonds trade at junk levels and its credit rating was lowered to A-3 from A-2 by the Midroog rating agency, though it was removed from the Credit Watch list in September. Extell, which has another 585 million shekels in bonds due next year, has been contending with a slowdown in the New York luxury real estate market.</p> \n<p>Not everyone is bearish on the Americans. One market source, who asked not to be named, said he wasn’t expecting any new bond issues during the bad atmosphere, but said many of the companies were performing well enough.</p> \n<p>An analyst speaking on condition of anonymity agreed. But he warned: “Not all of the companies have lost investors’ confidence, but if the companies don’t manage to calm investors, the repricing we’ve seen in recent days will hold and will make it hard to roll over the debt these companies need.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>This Thursday, the United States is presenting for a vote in the United Nations General Assembly a strong-worded anti-Hamas resolution, which&nbsp;reportedly has EU support. In what seems to be U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s final grand performance to please the pro-Israel right, she has presented a retaliatory resolution that fulfills the sole purpose of counterbalancing the United Nations’ “anti-Israel bias” by pushing the UN into a bias against the Palestinians instead.</p> \n<p>The one-page draft, which&nbsp;calls for a &quot;lasting and comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians,”&nbsp;makes no&nbsp;mention of the occupation, or how the blockade on Gaza – punctuated by periodic military escalations – has devastated almost all aspects of human life in the besieged enclave.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;UN expected to pass first-ever anti-Hamas resolution</p> \n<p>Instead, the proposed resolution inherently adopts and&nbsp;reiterates all right-wing Israeli textbook stereotypes of what has caused the 12 years of catastrophe in Gaza: It condemns Hamas’ “incitement to violence,” the Islamic Jihad’s improvised rockets, and the plunder of “resources in Gaza to construct military infrastructure,” as if these are solely responsible for all of Gaza’s misery and impoverishment over the last decade, and nothing else.</p> \n<p>No mention even of something like how&nbsp;the near-prohibition on freedom of movement for individuals in and out of Gaza, coupled with&nbsp;a decade-long ban on most Gazan exports and imports, has compromised the enclave’s economy and led its people to utter despair. Or how such a destructive cycle of isolation and violence accelerates Gaza’s ever-nearing irreversible fall into the “uninhabitable” abyss.</p> \n<p>In retaliation,&nbsp;Hamas tried to deliver a statement, signed by Ismael Haniyeh, to the head of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, blaming the current status quo and periodic Israeli-Hamas escalations on the “illegal and inhumane siege” on Gaza, while defending the use of “armed resistance” as a means to realizing “self-determination.”</p> \n<p>However, it wasn’t Hamas’ little-noticed statement –&nbsp;which wasn’t even accepted by the General Assembly – that caught the Palestinian public’s eye. Rather Palestinians were surprised by the exceptional pushback against the U.S. proposal, undertaken by Hamas’ worst internal Palestinian rival – the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority.</p> \n<p>From the moment the U.S. began lobbying for support on its anti-Hamas draft, the PA has exerted enormous efforts to thwart or at least postpone the vote on the resolution, while Palestinian Ambassador to the UN, Ryiad Mansour, continues to pressure UN member states to abstain or vote against the resolution.</p> \n<p>Several PA leaders&nbsp;reiterated their concern that the anti-Hamas resolution would “target the whole Palestinian people” by focusing the blame for the failure of the peace process solely on Palestinian/Hamas actions, and thus undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian struggle.</p> \n<p>Senior PLO leader&nbsp;Mohammad Shtayyeh concluded, “We will not accept in any way a resolution that condemns Hamas,” while other&nbsp;Fatah leaders took things a step further, expressing hope that this rare show of Palestinian unity – or strange bedfellows – would rebuild trust between the sides and be a step towards resuming Palestinian reconciliation efforts.</p> \n<p>Hamas, for its part, retreated from its traditional smear of PA leaders&nbsp;to instead applaud “the ceaseless efforts” of PA Ambassador Mansour, and praise the “responsible” PA position that “shows genuine [care for] national interest.”</p> \n<p>The general mood among Hamas’ leadership at the moment is one of respect and gratitude toward the PA’s strong position in defense of the Islamist movement. However, the possibility of exploiting such a mutually positive atmosphere to push the reconciliation process forward – and with it, the efforts of the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process to create sustainable tranquility and stability in Gaza – remains largely contingent upon the results of Thursday’s vote.</p> \n<p>The U.S. anti-Hamas&nbsp;resolution applauds all efforts and mediation that foster “intra-Palestinian reconciliation,” but if passed, it would not solve or ease any current predicaments. Instead, it would create only more insurmountable roadblocks in the path to Palestinian unity.</p> \n<p>The 2011 Palestinian reconciliation agreement stipulates that Hamas should be given a role in the PLO and PA, in order to pave the way toward free and fair national elections. However, if Hamas is condemned in the UN General Assembly, the PA will encounter further difficulties in bringing Hamas into the PLO and PA without facing a global backlash, or even a boycott. There’s a precedence for such an international boycott in 2006, when Hamas won the last Palestinian elections and formed a widely-boycotted unity government with Fatah.</p> \n<p>Expectations should not be too high even if the U.S. proposal does not pass. But at the very least, this would prevent further deterioration in the peace process and the intra-Palestinian reconciliation talks. In the best-case scenario, the Palestinians’ spirit of internal triumph, brought on by the success of this unusual show of Palestinian unity and solidarity, would be a promising stepping stone toward fostering progress in the largely-despairing Palestinian society.</p> \n<p>Either way, the Trump administration’s score-settling campaign against the Palestinians has created an opportunity and an incentive for both Hamas and Fatah to demonstrate their ability to transcend factional interests and work for the overall Palestinian wellbeing. It remains to be seen how each side will take advantage of this significant event.</p> \n<p>But before that, the more urgent question&nbsp;is what UN member states will choose Thursday regarding this victim-blaming resolution. Will they vote ‘yes’ and support Trump’s purposeless, unconstrained attack on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, or vote ‘no’ and transcend this narrow-minded attempt to score some political points and prevent further roadblocks to peace and progress from coming into being?</p> \n<p>The prospects for Israeli-Palestinian peace have incurred enough horrifying damage under U.S. President Donald Trump; beginning from his&nbsp;administration’s attack on UNRWA, the life-support system that sustains the impoverished Palestinian population; through the unilateral step to “take Jerusalem off the table”; to&nbsp;defunding East Jerusalem hospitals; and even&nbsp;slashing funds for Israeli-Palestinian coexistence and peace groups; with yet more to come. If any progress toward peace is to be hoped for, then UN member states shouldn’t indulge this mess.</p> \n<p>Muhammad Shehada is a writer and civil society activist from the Gaza Strip and a student of Development Studies at Lund University, Sweden.

        "text":["<p>Jewish Voice for Peace works to end U.S. law enforcement trainings with Israeli military and security forces because they are harmful – to Palestinians, Israelis, and to communities in the United States. We think they validate and encourage Israel’s policies of Apartheid and occupation, while contributing to further militarization of U.S. borders and policing. In the past year, our Deadly Exchange campaign to end these programs has started scoring some impressive victories – from legislation in Durham to the grassroots coalitions that last week led state and city decision makers in Vermont and Northampton, Massachusetts, to pull their police out of the tour sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League.</p> \n<p>The decisions were based on a very simple principle, summed up by the mayor of Northampton, David Narkewicz: “[Police Chief Jody] Kasper and I have both come to the conclusion that it is in the best interests of our city that she not participate in the National Leadership Seminar in Israel.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Opinion // Campaign against U.S.-Israel police programs is the BDS version of blood libel</p> \n<p>Serving the best interests of our communities is what drives the campaign, and what brought diverse coalitions together across the city of Northampton and the state of Vermont. These coalitions were multifaith and multiracial and intergenerational, and were led by American and Israeli Jews and Palestinians. They included organizations focused on a wide spectrum of issues – immigrant rights, fighting Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, the Movement for Black Lives, queer and trans rights.</p> \n<p>The ADL tries to keep these trips out of public view, and even adds legal disclaimers in emails to try to conceal basic information like participants’ names, dates of trips, and itineraries. But persistent appeals through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests have revealed the shape of the program. We know that these delegations bring high-ranking U.S. police, ICE, Customs and Border Patrol, and FBI officials to meet with top officials from the IDF, as well as with a range of Israeli security forces – Shin Bet, airport officials, prison officials, Israeli and Palestinian Authority police, and private security and arms corporations.</p> \n<p>We know the curriculum centers around visits to checkpoints, settlements including Hebron, prisons, airport security, right-wing think-tanks, private security firms, and multinational arms corporations like Elbit.</p> \n<p>We know that Israeli armed forces, including the military and police, have a well-documented history of violence and grave human rights abuses, particularly in the areas of racial profiling, surveillance, mistreatment of prisoners, suppression of social movements, and divisive “us vs. them” thinking. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Israeli government and private industry rebranded and marketed the tools, tactics, and technologies developed through 70 years of dispossession of the Palestinians and 50 years of military occupation into “field tested” counter-terrorism “best practices.” This is what is on offer for these delegations.</p> \n<p>It is common sense that city or state governments concerned with protecting the most vulnerable in our communities would choose to abstain from those lessons.</p> \n<p>This is true especially for those officials who are concerned with addressing and ending our own deep crises of police violence and militarization here in the United States – from police murdering black people with impunity to ICE and border control ripping apart migrant families at an unprecedented rate. Rooting out the deep institutional racism within the very foundation of American law enforcement requires digging in very deeply here at home, and lessons from an occupying army are not going to help.</p> \n<p>It is precisely because we understand and experience the long roots of state violence in the American context that we oppose the deepening of U.S.-Israel security cooperation. This is what makes Jonathan Tobin’s argument, published Tuesday in Haaretz, particularly egregious. He suggests that the campaign seeks to frame Israel and its American Jewish supporters as being ultimately responsible for state violence against people of color in the United States. We never have and never would suggest that, and agree that such a framing is not only anti-Semitic, but racist and deeply ahistoric. Underlying the whole concept of the campaign is our understanding that policing in the United States operates as one of the primary systems that upholds racism and white supremacy today, with deep roots in slavery and settler colonialism.</p> \n<p>It is also true that nation states do not operate in a vacuum and do exchange arms, money, tactics, technologies and expertise. In this political moment when right-wing forces are coalescing, leaders from the United States to Israel, from Brazil to Hungary are not shy about promoting the interplay between their shared and devastating agendas. And it’s clearer than ever that the so-called security policies of those leaders, as well as the way they may learn from each other, put many of us at grave risk.</p> \n<p>Seeing the connection and exchange between our unique contexts is not to collapse or conflate them. When ICE teargasses asylum-seeking families at the U.S.-Mexico border, it reminds us of the Great Return March, when the Israeli military responded to Palestinian protests at the Gaza fence by killing well over 150 people, and wounding more than 16,000 – which reminds us of Standing Rock, when US police in riot gear attacked unarmed water protectors – which reminds us of Ferguson, when protesters faced down an army of police in the wake of Michael Brown’s murder. In all these locations, in the face of state violence, people struggling for liberation see a reflection of their own faces and struggles in each other. It’s by making these connections that we can begin to show up to protect and defend and struggle alongside each other.</p> \n<p>That’s what we mean when we talk about the best interests of our communities. It’s the work to build safety through solidarity. The decisions not to participate in police exchanges by Durham, Vermont and Northampton are examples of this creativity and determination. Ending police exchanges is one small contribution we can make toward this world, and a vision of safety and freedom that includes all of us.</p> \n<p>Stefanie Fox is Deputy Director of Jewish Voice for Peace. She has an MA in Public Health focused on community organizing, and nearly two decades of experience doing grassroots movement building across a wide range of racial, economic, and social justice issues.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Moshe Carmel was a well-known figure in Jerusalem in the 1970s and ‘80s. First he worked as a salesman in a furniture store; later he headed a chain of furniture stores. Then he became the proud owner of some of the best-known hot spots in town, among them the Chinese restaurant Mandarin and the club Metzuda.</p> \n<p>He also owned the Lido restaurant on the Dead Sea and was a co-owner with the singer Aris San of the Aris San restaurant in Jaffa.</p> \n<p>When Carmel died 20 years ago, he left a secret: four albums of pictures he had rescued from a burning photography store in Jerusalem during the 1947-49 War of Independence.</p> \n<p>The albums, which he kept wrapped in wool blankets in a closet in his home, contain hundreds of photos showing events from the riots of 1929 to the battles of 1948. They include his underground activities against the British before the War of Independence and the beginnings of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Some include scenes documented nowhere else.</p> \n<p>At least two of the albums are linked to the photography department of Jerusalem’s American Colony neighborhood; they contain pictures of the area. They may have been catalogues used by the photography store from which customers would choose a photo they wanted to print.</p> \n<p>The American Colony Photography Department, which was in operation from the end of the 19th century, is considered to have produced some of the most important documentation of the city at the time. Some of these pictures are known from other collections, especially the Matson photograph collection in the U.S. Library of Congress, which contains thousands of photos of the American Colony.</p> \n<p>The albums also include detailed captions in English for every picture. The names of famous Arab photographers Ibrahim Risas and Khalil Raad are stamped on the back of some of the photos.</p> \n<p>Carmel was born in 1919 in Jerusalem’s Geula neighborhood. In the 1930s he joined the Etzel pre-state underground and during the War of Independence he served in north Jerusalem near the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. He said that during the fighting he found himself in a photography store that had been shelled and caught fire; he tried to save what he could.</p> \n<p>His wife Batya, who kept the photos, died in 2005. Four years ago their son Roni donated the albums to Hebrew University’s Ben Zvi Institute.</p> \n<p>“My mother had wrapped the albums in blankets and no one knew about them except for the family,” Roni said. “Sometimes when I was sick and there was no television or phone, they would take them out for me. After my mother died I decided, enough, there’s no reason for them to stay in the closet.”</p> \n<p>The photos, which were researched by Lavi Shay and Yoram Ilan of the Ben Zvi Institute archive, went on display last week at the institute in an exhibit on the anniversary of the Balfour Declaration, which was issued on November 29, 1917.</p> \n<p>According to the exhibit’s curator, Nirit Shalev-Khalifa, and the curator of the American Colony Hotel, Rachel Lev, the store where the albums were found was in the city’s Mamilla neighborhood.</p> \n<p>The photos in one album show the extensive damage caused by Arab attacks on Jewish communities and vice versa in the 1929 riots. It includes pictures of ruined and burned houses of the Jewish community of Hebron, the homes of the Makleff and Broza families in Motza near Jerusalem, and the wounded and the dead.</p> \n<p>There are also photos of the attack by Jews on the Nebi Akasha Mosque in central Jerusalem. The spokesman of the Jewish community in Hebron, Noam Arnon, an expert on photos documenting the 1929 Hebron riots, concedes that he doesn’t know most of the photos from Carmel’s album.</p> \n<p>“The riots were on Saturday, Jews weren’t taking pictures,” he said. Other photos show the British forces sent to quell the riots and Arab protest demonstrations.</p> \n<p>Another album is devoted to Hebrew University, showing the buildings, students, faculty, laboratories and library in the ‘30s. Some of the photos are known from the Matson collection. For people who know the university’s huge campus today, the pictures from those days are a painful reminder of the site’s lost beauty.</p> \n<p>A third album has photos of the bloody incidents that preceded the War of Independence, among them the evacuation of the wounded from the bombing of the King David Hotel in July 1946, and the damage from the terror attack on Ben Yehuda Street in February 1948. Also documented is the removal of the bodies of the two British sergeants whom the Etzel executed near Netanya in July 1947.</p> \n<p>The album that documents 1948 contains dozens of photos of fighters and battles from that year. Many of them show the Arab irregulars of the Holy War Army&nbsp;who fought in Jerusalem under the command of Abdel-Qader al-Husseini.</p> \n<p>The fighters are shown training, setting out on operations, and taking part in ambushes and battles. Among the people who appear frequently are Husseini, his uncle, Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini, and the commander of the Arab Liberation Army, Fauzi al-Qawuqji.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The photos are also important for research into the American Colony Photography Department. That huge collection found its way into collections all over the world, and the fate of some of the pictures and negatives is still unknown. The albums saved by Carmel apparently include some previously unknown American Colony photographs.</p> \n<p>These albums were “part of the life story of Moshe Carmel, who was a witness to the events and also froze them in time. Now they have been revealed to the public with the various interpretations they can be given,” said Shalev-Khalifa, the Ben Zvi exhibition curator</p> \n<p>Of Moshe Carmel, his son Roni says his father was “a very special man.

However, he did not directly address the tunnels.</p> \n<p>According to Qassem, before the recent botched undercover operation&nbsp;in Gaza, Israel did not consider an operation in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Israeli discourse shows that war with Lebanon is out of the question for them,&quot; he said. &quot;In their threats and analyses, they say that they will attack if Hezbollah does.

The military says it opens fire only as a last resort, and considers firing at the lower limbs an act of restraint.</p> \n<p>Still, 175 Palestinians have been shot to death, according to an Associated Press count. And the number of wounded has reached colossal proportions.</p> \n<p>Of the 10,511 protesters treated at hospitals and field clinics in Gaza so far, at least 6,392, or roughly 60 percent, have been struck in the lower limbs, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. At least 5,884 of those casualties were hit by live ammunition; others have been hit by rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas canisters.</p> \n<p>The upsurge in violence has left a visible mark on Gaza that will likely remain for decades to come. It is now common to see young men walking through dilapidated streets on crutches. Most have legs bandaged or fitted with a metal frame called a fixator, which uses pins or screws that are inserted into fractured bones to help stabilize them.</p> \n<p>The wounded can often be seen gathering at a treatment clinic run by the Paris-based medical charity Doctors Without Borders in Gaza City, where Associated Press photographer Felipe Dana took portraits of some of them.</p> \n<p>Some of those he photographed acknowledged throwing stones toward Israeli troops during the demonstrations. One said he had hurled a firebomb. But others said they were unarmed bystanders; one paramedic said he was helping rescue the wounded, while another man said he was waving a Palestinian flag and another said he was selling coffee and tea.</p> \n<p>International human rights groups have said the military’s open-fire rules are unlawful because they allow the use of potentially lethal force in situations where soldiers’ lives are not in immediate danger.</p> \n<p>Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, rejected international criticism that Israel’s response has been excessive. Instead, he said that firing at people’s legs was a sign of restraint.</p> \n<p>“Sniper rifles against hundreds or thousands of rioters that are violently trying to get into Israel with the open aim of killing Israeli civilians or abducting Israeli soldiers, I don’t think that’s disproportionate,” he said. “I don’t think it’s disproportionate to shoot at feet or legs to get them to stop, rather than killing them.”</p> \n<p>Doctors Without Borders said this month that the huge number of patients was overwhelming Gaza’s health care system, which has already been severely weekend by a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt that has fueled economic stagnation and rampant unemployment, and devastated water and electricity supplies.</p> \n<p>The Paris-based aid group said the majority of the 3,117 patients it has treated have been shot in the legs, and many will need follow-up surgery, physiotherapy and rehabilitation.</p> \n<p>“These are complex and serious injuries that do not quickly heal,” the group said. “Their severity and the lack of appropriate treatment in Gaza’s crippled health system means that infection is a high risk, especially for patients with open fractures.”</p> \n<p>“The consequences of these wounds ... will be lifelong disability for many,” the aid group said. “And if infections are not tackled, then the results could be amputation or even death.”</p> \n<p>Gaza’s Health Ministry says it has carried out 94 amputations since the protests began, 82 of them involving lower limbs.</p>",

To enter such a site, one would have to key in a code.</p> \n<p>“I’m concerned about laws that are designed to censor social networks and the internet. We don’t want children to be exposed to damaging content, but my concern is that the internet – where there is no government regulation – will be subject to such regulation,&quot;&nbsp;Netanyahu&nbsp;said at a meeting of Likud cabinet members.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Editorial:&nbsp;A dangerous, senseless law&nbsp;■ Analysis:&nbsp;Israel's anti-porn bill isn’t designed to protect children but to shame parents</p> \n<p>&quot;Who will determine which content is permitted and which is forbidden? Who will determine its interpretation?” Netanyahu asked, adding that he would meet Zohar and examine ways to overcome his concerns. “One has to be very cautious about bringing a regulator into this area,” Netanyahu said.</p> \n<p>MK Shuli Moalem-Refali (Habayit Hayehudi), who co-initiated the bill, responded to Netanyahu on Army Radio. “When he hears what we are proposing, he’ll change his mind,” she said. Zohar added that the “final version is excellent and I’m sure Netanyahu will support it. The aim is solely to protect minors, letting adults decide for themselves. There is nothing better for the country’s children and for ensuring our society’s future in terms of preventing sexual harassment and the objectification&nbsp;of women,” said Zohar.</p> \n<p>Last week, Zohar and Moalem-Refaeli softened the bill’s version. In contrast to the earlier version, the new one does not block websites as the default option, and will require approval by users. The previous version had been criticized by Knesset members and people in the high-tech industry, who believe the measure was disproportionate.</p> \n<p>According to the bill’s final version, internet providers will ask users if they wish to block content partially (through an access code), fully, or not at all. If the user does not respond to the internet provider’s question three times, the sites will be blocked until the user requests to clear them. Users will be asked every three months whether they want porn sites blocked and providers will be paid 50 agurot ($0.13) a year for each customer agreeing to block these sites. Providers will be obligated to erase information about user habits, after concerns were raised about the formation of porn databases.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Israeli operation to locate the tunnels along the border with Lebanon is now entering its second stage. After the surprising announcement about the discovery of the tunnels and the media campaign against Hezbollah, the IDF is now moving on to systematically surveying the border region. So far, the discovery of two tunnels in Israeli territory has been reported, and the location of a third tunnel on the Lebanese side of the border has been provided to UN forces.</p> \n<p>In the Lebanese political arena, the continued silence of Hezbollah has stood out – alongside the embarrassment that the affair has brought on among the rest of the country’s power centers.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Hezbollah's tunnels prove Nasrallah has cracked Israel's DNA ■ Netanyahu spins operation into Armageddon-style mission</p> \n<p>The IDF’s initial assessment that it would take a month to complete the operation could well turn out to be too optimistic. The identification of the tunnels is proceeding at the planned pace, but it is possible that the destruction of their routes will take longer than originally estimated. The IDF’s assessment was that Hezbollah would avoid a direct military response, as long as the tunnels were located and destroyed inside Israeli territory and as long as the group sustained no casualties as a result of Israeli operations.</p> \n<p>The main risk at the moment concerns the spilling over of local incidents into a broader escalation, even without the parties aiming for that. Last Saturday, an IDF engineering force opened fire at three suspicious figures, apparently Hezbollah lookouts, who came close to the area where the IDF is working along the border.</p> \n<p>Along with the location and destruction of the tunnels, Israel also wants to take advantage of the discovery and the publicity for two goals: Leveraging it for the public relations war against Hezbollah in the international arena, and speeding up the construction of the new wall at disputed points along the border, in the area of Manara and Misgav Am in the east, and east of Rosh Hanikra in the west.</p> \n<p>IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot&nbsp;met on Sunday in his office in the Kirya headquarters in Tel Aviv with the commander of UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, Italian Maj. Gen. Stefano Del Col. Eisenkot told him that the digging of the tunnels is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which was passed at the end of the Second Lebanon War.</p> \n<p>The IDF has prepared an intelligence file on every tunnel, which includes data “incriminating” Hezbollah in violating the UN resolution. Israel will try to use the violations by Hezbollah as justification for continuing the work on building the wall, which so far have been conducted at a slow pace in disputed areas, partly out of a fear of a harsh response by Hezbollah.</p> \n<p>At a time when a debate is being conducted in Israel over the importance of the discovery of the tunnels, and claims are being made that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the IDF have inflated the important intelligence revelation into an “operation” whose practical significance is limited, Eisenkot actually attributes great importance to it. In closed discussions, Eisenkot describes the tunnels as the secret, missing component in Hezbollah’s plan of attack along the border when a war breaks out.</p> \n<p>In his opinion, moving dozens and even hundreds of soldiers through them would have caused greater damage than that expected from the dozens of precision missiles that, in his assessment, are in the hands of Hezbollah today. (The Israeli effort to prevent the smuggling of such precision weaponry from Syria to Lebanon has so far prevented the accumulation of a larger number of such missiles.)</p> \n<p>Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah is avoiding, for now, any public comment on the discovery of the tunnels. Over the weekend, Nasrallah’s deputy, Sheikh Naim Qassem, who Israel is not at all certain was in on the secret of digging the tunnels, said that Hezbollah has rockets capable of hitting any place in Israel – a factual statement, even if it says nothing new.</p> \n<p>The president of Lebanon, Saad el-Din al-Hariri, reiterated his country’s commitment to Resolution 1701, but in the meantime, he has not visited the area of the border with Israel and has not commented on the crisis. Hariri canceled a planned visit to France because of the “security situation” (the wave of protests in France), without even mentioning the new security situation developing along its southern border.</p> \n<p>Israel’s PR war</p> \n<p>The public relations war that Israel has been fighting against Hezbollah and the Lebanese government is part of an ongoing diplomatic effort whose goal is to constrain Hezbollah’s and Iran’s moves on Israel’s northern front. Netanyahu’s visit to Metula last week, and the large number of Israeli statements about the tunnel revelations, complete the process whose objective is to deter Hezbollah and prevent the upgrading of its military capabilities.</p> \n<p>The battle over legitimacy, including the aspects of international law involved, will assume a large place in any war that could break out in Lebanon in the future. In October, the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, a Washington, D.C. based pro-Israel think tank that brings together retired senior American defense officials and officers, released a detailed report on this question. Three former U.S. generals visited and toured Israel to prepare the report, and met with senior government officials, officers on the IDF General Staff and in the Military Advocate General unit.</p> \n<p>The authors of the report, entitled “Israel’s Next Northern War: Operational and Legal Challenges,” say that if a war breaks out in the north, it will not be similar at all to the conflicts Israel has experienced in the past. They expect such a war to have unprecedented amounts of destruction and casualties, including deaths, on both sides. The authors say that Hezbollah’s military capabilities have improved greatly after seven years in which its soldiers took part in the civil war in Syria. But Hezbollah has no illusions it can defeat the IDF on the battlefield. Its goal is to achieve a political victory, states the report.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah plans on achieving this victory by intentionally risking the lives of Lebanese civilians (whom Hezbollah uses frequently as “human shields”), manipulation of the narrative about the events of the war and exploitation of the mistakes of the international community in understanding the laws of war. The JINSA authors say Hezbollah and Iran will strive to present Israel during the war as “an immoral murderer of civilians.” Their goal will be to damage Israel’s international legitimacy to continue to fight, before the IDF can translate its military advantage into a victory on the battlefield.</p> \n<p>The report says the next war in the north will not be conducted only with tanks and missiles – it will also be a war of information, which will be decided by international public opinion, no less than on the battlefield. They say that Israel often makes more effort than necessary according to international law to protect the lives of enemy civilians. But the authors say that in real time, Israel hesitates and lags in presenting the information that could well prove its claims. The result, during the Second Lebanon War in 2006 and during Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip in 2014, is that Israel lost the information war to its enemies.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The evidentiary phase in the trial of the two men indicted for the 2015 firebomb murders of three members of a Palestinian family, including an 18-month-old boy, was to begin Sunday in the Lod District Court.</p> \n<p>So far, the court has been dealing with pre-trial hearings involving the confessions to murder by the main defendant, Amiram Ben-Uliel, in an arson attack on the Dawabsheh family’s home in the West Bank village of Duma. The other defendant’s identity has not been made public because he was a minor at the time of the crime.</p> \n<p>In June, the court ruled two of the confessions inadmissable as evidence. However, the court accepted a third confession, which included a reenactment of the murder, and so the prosecution believes it still has a strong case. Officials in the Justice Ministry told Haaretz at the end of the preliminary hearings that the prosecution has a variety of other evidence, including some that is circumstantial and that contains confidential details indicating that Ben-Uliel knew about the murder.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Who is Amiram Ben-Uliel, the alleged killer of the Dawabsheh family? ■ Haaretz Q&amp;A: Duma attack and Jewish terrorists</p> \n<p>In the attack in the village of Duma, masked men broke a window in the Dawabsheh family home around 4 A.M. and threw an incendiary device inside. Ahmed Dawabsheh, now 6, was the only survivor of the ensuing blaze. His 18-month-old brother Ali was burned to death, while his parents Sa’ad and Reham died from their injuries weeks later.</p> \n<p>The other man’s confessions of participation in the murders have been ruled inadmissible, but his confessions regarding six other nationalistic incidents in which he was involved, including attempted arson and hate crimes including vandalism, have been accepted. In the case of the Dawabsheh murders, the man gave what the prosecution calls “hypothetical confessions”– a confession that is not straightforward and is considered much weaker than a standard confession.</p> \n<p>He described how the murder could have taken place, but did not do so in the first person or mention names. He was not charged with murder, because according to the indictment, he did not come to Duma on the night it was claimed he and Ben-Uliel had decided on. However, Haaretz reported in June that in Ben-Uliel’s confession, which was accepted by the court, the name of the minor was mentioned.</p> \n<p>The confessions that deemed inadmissible were extracted under methods of interrogation that are only permitted in a “ticking bomb” situation. Law enforcement officials have said these methods was justified because it was feared the suspects knew about a network planning similar violent attacks. In fact, two failed attempts were subsequently made to carry out attacks like the one at Duma.</p> \n<p>In September, the court decided to hold the trial in open court, except for future sessions where Shin Bet security service members are to testify. According to the suspects’ attorneys, including Zion Amir, Adi Kedar, Asher Ohayon and Itzhak Bam, a senior Shin Bet interrogator was to testify on Sunday morning, thus that session was to take place behind closed doors.</p> \n<p>The suspects’ attorneys said Sunday’s witness, who had also testified at the preliminary hearings, was the head of the team that conducted the interrogations in the Shin Bet. The court has also allowed all the minutes of the preliminary proceedings to remain confidential.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Diaspora Affairs Minister Naftali Bennett will spearhead a new government effort to lure French Jews to Israel. He was tapped for the assignment by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Sunday’s weekly cabinet meeting.</p> \n<p>Bennett insinuated at the cabinet meeting that all previous government efforts to boost immigration from France had failed dismally. In response, Netanyahu asked him to take charge of a new campaign.</p> \n<p>The number of Jews living in France is estimated at 470,000 – the largest Jewish community in Europe. Bennett told the cabinet that 200,000 of them were eager to move to Israel but that the state was not in a position to absorb them.</p> \n<p>“It is our moral obligation to rise to the occasion and help them,” he said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Why the expected wave of French immigration to Israel never materialized</p> \n<p>Israeli officials with deep knowledge of the French Jewish community, however, charged that Bennett was exaggerating. According to them, no more than 50,000 French Jews are considering moving to Israel today.</p> \n<p>Officials active in promoting immigration expressed surprise that Bennett had been chosen by Netanyahu to lead the new effort. Immigration promotion, they noted, has traditionally come under the authority of the Jewish Agency and the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration. The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, they noted, has never before been involved in such activities.</p> \n<p>Last month, Yisrael Beiteinu, the party headed by former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, quit the government. Sofa Landver, a member of Yisrael Beiteinu, had served as minister of aliyah and integration. Since her party joined the opposition, this ministerial post she filled has been left vacant.</p> \n<p>In an effort to explain Bennett’s newly developed interest in the French Jewish community, some officials with knowledge of it suggested that because its members tend to be religious and right wing, they could be seen as potential voters for the party he heads – the settler-aligned, Orthodox Habayit Hayehudi.</p> \n<p>The fact that more French Jews have not moved to Israel, Bennett told the cabinet, represented a “missed historical opportunity.”</p> \n<p>Between 2013 and 2015, Israel experienced a large wave of immigration from France. The exodus was sparked both by a rise in anti-Semitic incidents and a depressed local economy. Since 2015, however, when close to 8,000 French Jews moved to Israel, the numbers have dropped steadily. In 2017, a little more than 3,500 French Jews moved to Israel, and that number is expected to drop by about 25 percent for 2018.</p> \n<p>Many French Jews who moved to Israel during the peak years have since returned to France. Difficulties with the Hebrew language and with finding work commensurate with their skills have been cited as the key obstacles to their successful integration into Israeli society.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu asked Bennett to draft a program for boosting immigration from France in conjunction with the National Economic Council, which operates under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s Office. This program will be discussed by the ministerial committee for immigration and absorption, which is headed by the prime minister.</p> \n<p>During the cabinet meeting, Bennett briefed the ministers on the activities of his ministry, bemoaning the high rate of assimilation among Jews living outside Israel. “Israel and the Diaspora are in the throes of an unprecedented crisis,” he said. “We’re used to being told that it’s because of [prayer rules at] the Western Wall, the Palestinian issue and other ideological controversies. It’s not correct. There’s a terrible problem of assimilation and growing indifference of Jews overseas both to their Jewishness and to Israel. That is the entire story, and it can be defined as a national challenge.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Seven people were wounded in a drive-by shooting attack near the settlement of Ofra in the West Bank on Sunday evening. Security forces have launched a manhunt for the assailants.</p> \n<p>One of those wounded was a 21-year-old pregnant woman who was in serious condition after sustaining wounds to her upper body. She was evacuated to Shaare Zedek&nbsp;Hospital in Jerusalem, where doctors delivered her baby prematurely. On Monday morning, the hospital's director said the woman's condition stabilized during the night, while the baby's condition worsened and was now in critical condition.</p> \n<p>The rest of the victims were also evacuated to a number of hospitals in Jerusalem, including a 21-year-old man who sustained moderate wounds to his lower limbs and a 22-year-old man was also moderately wounded. The other victims are two 16-year-old girls and two 16-year-old boys, all of whom sustained light wounds.</p> \n<p>According to people in the settlement, the 21-year-old woman was waiting for a ride together with her husband, who was also wounded and is in moderate condition. The two live in the area, but not in Ofra.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces said the shooting was conducted from a moving vehicle and targeted civilians trying to catch a ride from the nearby junction. According to rescue services, the shooting targeted a group of people located near the entrance to the town.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>An IDF force stationed nearby fired at the vehicle before the driver fled the scene. Footage from the scene shows a white vehicle slowing down near the hitchiking stop and stopping briefly. After shots are fired from the vehicle, IDF soldiers shoot at the car, which then continued north on Route 60.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The IDF said it is searching for the shooter in the nearby village of Silwad and has set up checkpoints. Palestinian&nbsp;residents&nbsp;reported that large military forces entered Silwad, which is east of Ramallah, and have raided a house. Residents also reported that the IDF is searching in the nearby village of Ein Yabrud, just west of Ofra. The troops collected security cameras located in the village.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the attack in a video clip on his official Facebook page: “Everyone is praying for the wellbeing of the young woman who is fighting for her life – her baby was saved, and we are also wishing a speedy recovery to all the wounded. We will not rest until we find these murderous criminals and bring them to justice.” Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister’s wife, also wished the victims a speedy and full recovery in the video.</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin said on Monday morning: “We are praying with great concern for the recovery of the wounded in the criminal terrorist attack, and among them the young mother who brought life to the world out of the horror.” Rivlin wished the victims a quick recovery and praised “all the security forces who are chasing down the terrorists relentlessly.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas praised the terrorist attack late on Sunday: “Despite all the attempts to uproot the resistance to the occupation, the action on [Sunday] evening proves that the principle of resistance is still alive and beating,” said the organization.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East peace process, Jason Greenblatt, slammed the attack as &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot; and criticized the United Nations for failing to pass a resolution condemning Hamas last Thursday.</p> \n<p>&quot;.@UN this is what you defended last week when you failed to condemn Hamas. Hamas praises yet another terror attack. You had the ability to help fight against terror. Is this what the UN wants its legacy to be?&quot; Greenblatt tweeted late on Sunday.</p> \n<p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman also weighed in: &quot;Hamas calls the shooters “heroic” — yes, the same #Hamas that the @UN could not resolve to condemn last week,&quot; he wrote.</p> \n<p>On Monday morning, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked called on Netanyahu to legalize the status of all the homes in Ofra in response to the shootings. Many homes in the settlement are not included in the town’s master plan and require arrangements to legalize their status. Shaked said she has a draft version ready of the legal arrangements needed to do so.</p> \n<p>“Terrorists who carry out such terror attacks know that even if they are caught they will receive a lot of money, they and their families,” and she and Education Minister Naftali Bennett are acting on the issue to prevent Palestinian terrorists from receiving payment for their crimes, said Shaked, referring to a bill that would deduct such funds from money transferred to the Palestinian Authority and use it instead for settlement.</p> \n<p>Many other politicians commented on the terrorist attack and wished the victims a speedy recovery, including Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, MK Yair Lapid and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman also said that he trusts the IDF and security forces to catch the terrorists quickly.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the IDF Spokesman's Office said a suspect was arrested in the shooting attack that took place at the Gilboa checkpoint in November. According to the IDF, the suspect and another person suspected of assisting him, have been transferred to the Shin Bet for further investigation.</p> \n<p>In October,&nbsp;two Israelis were killed and a third was wounded in a&nbsp;West Bank shooting attack in the Barkan industrial area. The IDF is still searching for the shooter,&nbsp;23-year-old&nbsp;Ashraf Walid Saliman Na'alwa.</p>",

        "text":["<p>JoAnne McArthur is a Canadian photographer who’s won many awards for documenting the relationship between humans and animals. Half a year ago she came to Israel as a guest of an animal rights group called Israel Against Live Shipments. She accompanied&nbsp;Israel Against Live Shipments activists to ports, quarantine depots, calf-fattening farms and cowsheds, taking pictures as she went along. She photographed the piles of carcasses of calves that had died en route or after arrival, including the yellow ear tags, which was all that remained in some cases. She photographed the looks, which always appeared embarrassed, turning to some distant point.</p> \n<p>The photograph shown here was taken by McArthur at a fattening farm run by Ran De-Levy, the third largest importer of calves and lambs in Israel, and one of the most aggressive spokesmen opposing animal rights groups. These groups are trying, among other things, to stop shipments of live calves and sheep for slaughter in Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>We’ll return to the campaign of De-Levy, who wishes to continue making a fortune from the transport and slaughter of hundreds of thousands of young animals a year&nbsp;– and to this photo.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, the Knesset passed the preliminary stage of a bill promoted by MK Miki Zohar (Likud), which calls for a gradual reduction of live shipments&nbsp;up to their complete halt within three years. The bill was written in cooperation with animal right groups Animals and Let the Animals Live (Tnu Lachayot Lichyot). The cabinet had approved the presentation of the law to the Knesset last July.</p> \n<p>For the last 20 years, animal rights groups activists have been waging a Sisyphean campaign against live shipments. Is the passing of the bill in its preliminary stage a landmark? The government and Knesset members would certainly not have voted in favor of this bill were it not for the success of these activists in increasing public awareness of these shipments, but the question remains as to whether this was only a symbolic act.</p> \n<p>At the end of the 1990s there was a sharp rise in the extent of live animal shipments to Israel, resulting from lower duties paid by importers of calves and sheep. An important turning point came in 2014, when the Netanyahu government, at the initiative of then-Finance Minister Yair Lapid, decided to reduce duties even further. Between January and October of 2018 there was a 40 percent uptick in the number of imported live animals, compared to the same period in 2017. 577,828 animals were brought in over that period.</p> \n<p>The main opponents of the law against live shipments are the large importers of calves, as well as Agriculture Minister Uri Ariel. He says that the abolition of sheep imports will greatly increase the price of meat and lead to loss of jobs. According to MK Yael Cohen-Paran (Zionist Union) and to figures published by the Economy Ministry, the lust of Israelis for meat can be met through importing fresh or chilled meat or through local producers.</p> \n<p>This fact supports the claim that the ministry of agriculture is acting in the interests of livestock importers, mainly Tnuva and Dabah, which have taken over the entire chain of production, from imports to fattening, slaughter and marketing.</p> \n<p>“There are many people making piles of money in this business” explains MK Cohen-Paran. “When Yair Lapid cancelled the duties on live shipments, customs on imported fresh meat went up. It wasn’t the public that profited from the reduced tariffs and Lapid actually opened the door to monopolies. Now, those tycoons are fighting this legislation like crazy, and the finance and agriculture ministers find it very difficult to oppose them.”</p> \n<p>From Australia to Israel without being able to move</p> \n<p>In August 2018, the export license of Australia’s largest exporter of sheep was revoked. An investigative report by Animals Australia, which was conducted covertly by those maligned activists, left the authorities no choice. Australian and Israeli media published the report, in which rare photos were taken in the holds of ships transporting calves and sheep to Israel. These photos showed thousands of densely packed sheep and lambs, unable to move and breathing heavily and rapidly, with mouths open, many of them dying or with their heads outstretched in an attempt to inhale some air into their bursting lungs. In one of these shipments 2,400 animals perished.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, there was some testimony by Lynne Simpson, an Australian veterinarian who worked on the ships bound for Israel. She was fired after exposing what was going on in those ships. She described animals suffering from heat, without room or air, sticking their necks out through railings in a desperate attempt to breathe some air. The strong ones climbed onto the backs of the weaker ones, in order to reach some air vents. Some of them cooked inside. She described how some of them just fell apart in front of her eyes.</p> \n<p>Occasionally there were live births on board. Most of the lambs born there never saw the outside world. They were either trampled to death or died of starvation, quietly, alone. In one photograph a tiny lamb could be seen lying on its own in the filth. It wasn’t dead yet, it was very much alive although it had nothing. It was still alive since the nature of a soul is to long for something, even something never encountered before. Cynical people call this the food industry.</p> \n<p>Young animals like to play. In shelters for farm animals, when young animals first find themselves in an open space, they kick their rear legs into the air while running, dancing in circles in what is a declaration of pure joy, expressed by an individual. In every motion one can see the baby-like clumsiness, common to young animals of all species, a dreamy film covering their eyes, their wondering look – all of this we kill shortly after birth. Not immediately – the striving, longing, fearful individual is killed only after arriving at the slaughterhouse.</p> \n<p>When these ships arrive in Israel, they are met by activists belonging to groups opposing these shipments. They stand there for long nights, waiting for the long columns of calves and lambs that start coming down the gangplank. They take pictures from a distance – they can’t come close. They once photographed a calf whose tailbone was broken to make it come off the ship. Beatings are routine, since the lambs and calves are scared to move forward.</p> \n<p>A scream beyond evolution</p> \n<p>And back to McArthur’s photo: even if we assume that De Levy’s calves are not physically abused – the way in which the calf lays its head on the neck of another one in that five-star fattening facility, that rare moment in which they cling to each other in a world that’s only waiting for the moment in which it’s profitable to end their lives – this moment reminds us that soon it will end abruptly, that they’ll be separated by force, that a sudden terror will freeze their blood, that they’ll be thrown onto a truck, perhaps seeing each other again at the slaughterhouse, waiting their turn.</p> \n<p>It reminds us that once they were born. There was one such moment. “We often hear crying when calves are taken from their mothers” says one of the cowshed workers in a 2017 documentary called Carnal, by Avner Matsliach.</p> \n<p>These two calves in the photo are the quiet monument which casts its giant shadow over the conception underlying this immense industry of death, exposing its cruelty. This conception is based on deep-seated contempt for the cognitive and emotional capabilities of animals.</p> \n<p>People who are executed don’t scream. They know it won’t help. So why do baby goats at the entrance to the slaughterhouse, or calves in quarantine and in slaughterhouses scream with all their might? Are they waiting for help? There are scientists who try to find an evolutionary explanation for every type of behavior. These animals scream since they cannot but scream. They’re asking no one for anything.</p> \n<p>One can hear the “enough” in their cries. Enough in its essential sense, not its verbal one. This scream says: “I”, “enough” and “don’t.” That’s all. It has no evolutionary purpose beyond that.</p> \n<p>On the contrary. It is the “I” that’s beyond evolution. Even if in nature there is sometimes a utilitarian purpose to screaming, calling a mother to help, this doesn’t change the fact that here we can hear an animal terrified of death in its most horrible moment, the cry of an individual, not of an evolutionary function. It’s not the voice of an “animal”. It’s the voice of a creature going to its death and it sounds the same for all of them. This is the food industry, this is the reality.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israeli ambassadors in a private conversation on Monday that he is considering restoring authority to the Foreign Ministry over areas of responsibility that had been transferred to other ministries.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the strategic affairs and Diaspora affairs ministries were among those that received authority to deal with matters that had been taken away from the Foreign Ministry.&nbsp;In addition, the National Security Council and Mossad intelligence agency have eroded the Foreign Ministry's responsibility when it comes to relations with Arab countries.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who also serves as foreign minister, was commenting about the need to change voting patterns by countries around the world in international forums. The Israeli ambassadors, whose salaries the Finance Ministry is currently seeking to cut, wondered how that could be accomplished to a significant extent if the cuts are carried out. Their situation has never been so bad, they told the prime minister.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: Netanyahu's vision for the Middle East has come true</p> \n<p>Since the withdrawal of the Yisrael Beiteinu party from the coalition last month and the resignation of the party's leader, Avidgor Lieberman, as defense minister, Netanyahu has taken on the defense minister's portfolio and also serves as immigrant absorption minister, health minister and religious services minister. He told the ambassadors that he would give up some of the portfolios, a move that will include the appointment of a full-time foreign minister. Last month, the prime minister's associates said he was considering appointing a foreign minister while retaining the defense minister's job.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the ambassadors about Israel's relations with the Arab world, Netanyahu said: &quot;When I meet with Arab leaders, the tell me: We have security and economic interests and we also want to enjoy the fruits of advancement, and we will no longer mortgage our normalization with the State of Israel to Palestinian whims.&quot;</p> \n<p>The prime minister added: &quot;That still doesn't mean peace agreements, but it does mean that a situation absolutely could be created in which our progress towards normalization and peace, instead of what we have always thought – that through peace with the Palestinians, [it can be achieved with] the Arab world&nbsp;– it could actually come in the reverse direction.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;I am not mortgaging peace with the Arab world to peace with the Palestinians. We are trying, and will continue to try, but one doesn't determine the other. It would be good if there is an agreement with the Palestinians, but it can't be conditioned [on the other],&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>The prime minister said the Sultan of Oman, Qabous bin Said, has permitted El Al Israel Airlines to overfly his country. El Al is currently at a disadvantage in its flights to India because it cannot overfly Saudi Arabia, while Air India can take this more direct route on its flights from Israel. Since El Al cannot fly over Oman without also flying over Saudi Arabia, the Omani concession is not of practical significance at the moment. With regard to an air route from Israel to Brazil, the prime minister said flights could overfly Egypt, Chad &quot;and also probably Sudan.&quot;</p> \n<p>Downsizing</p> \n<p>The workers' committee representing Foreign Ministry staff is currently seeking to head off new budget cuts at the ministry, which would include the reduction in the salaries paid to Israeli ambassadors. The workers' committee threated to impose labor sanctions if the cuts are carried out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The ministry budget has already been reduced in recent years. In January, the cabinet approved the closure of seven Israeli diplomatic missions abroad, although 22 offices had initially been slated to be shuttered. And instead of the proposed elimination of 140 staff positions at the Foreign Ministry's Jerusalem headquarters, the cabinet also adopted a plan to encourage staff to leave voluntarily.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Based on January's cabinet resolution, the government is considering downsizing its consular presence in the United States. Israel currently has diplomatic offices in Washington, Atlanta, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Chicago and New York. (The presence in New York includes the Israeli mission to the United Nations). Each mission costs between 8 and 15 million shekels ($2.1 to $4 million) a year to run.&nbsp; The Finance Ministry has suggested consolidating some of the offices, which would mainly save on rent and security expenses.</p> \n<p>The discussions have also focused on Israel's diplomatic presence in Canada, where there are consulates in Toronto and Montreal in addition to the embassy in Ottawa, and in Germany, where there is a consulate in Munich in addition to the Berlin embassy. There has been discussion of consolidating diplomatic offices in Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to a 2016 report from the State Comptroller's Office, following his reelection as prime minister in 2009, Netanyahu began transferring policy areas from the Foreign Ministry to other ministries. The process has caused a lack of coordination as well as disputes among ministries over areas of responsibility, the report alleged.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The prime minister didn’t call to say congratulations. Nor will he. This wasn’t a Eurovision Song Contest win and not even a medal in judo from Azerbaijan. The 2018 Human Rights Prize of the French Republic will be awarded this week to the human rights group B’Tselem. Israeli pride, honor and glory.</p> \n<p>And this is how the news was received in Israel: “This isn’t a prize, it’s a mark of shame. B’Tselem is an organization whose work should be stopped” – Culture Minister Miri Regev; “France cannot claim that it is fighting anti-Semitism” – deputy minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Michael Oren; “shame and moral abandon...the prize for the rights of opponents of the return to Zion” – editor of the editorial page of the daily Israel Hayom, Dror Eydar; “Summon the French ambassador for a rebuke” – the Israeli army reservists group My Truth.</p> \n<p>The prize this year is going to organizations subjected to pressure in their home countries. Together with B’Tselem, the Palestinian group Al-Haq won, along with human rights groups from China, Colombia, Nigeria and Belarus.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The real hero is the B'Tselem chief | Opinion</p> \n<p>If anyone needs proof as to why B’Tselem deserves the prize, not only for its important and laudable work, but also as an organization subjected to pressure and persecution in its home country, the responses in Israel provided it. In China, Nigeria, Colombia and Belarus the responses were certainly similar. There too, like in Israel, they don’t like human rights – Israel is in the company of the tyrannies of the world.</p> \n<p>There is no need to say anything more about the role played by B’Tselem and the honor it brings the state, more so than that of any judoka or singer. There is no need to even note that Regev, Oren and their ilk will soon be thrown into the trash heap of history, while B’Tselem and others like them will be remembered as the last keepers of the torch. What’s new and noteworthy here is that an Israeli organization is being awarded a prize for being persecuted in its own country. That hasn’t happened before.</p> \n<p>Organizations and individuals in Israel have won quite a few international awards for their work in safeguarding human rights under conditions of occupation. Now they are also considered persecuted. Hence the hysterical responses to the prize given to an organization that provides information, whose professionalism and credibility are unassailable and whose research even the Israeli army makes use of. Its critics know this, and therefore they cry out so loudly.</p> \n<p>B’Tselem is the last to hold a mirror to Israeli society, a mirror it never wanted to look into. B’Tselem shows Israel today, and so Israel Hayom (“Israel Today”) can’t stand it. Almost every one of B’Tselem’s reports should have been published in the Israeli media, and almost all of them are thrown into the garbage by most of the media.</p> \n<p>The sights seen in the B’Tselem mirror are ugly, and so Israel covers its eyes. But until now B’Tselem had not been persecuted and its people, the Jews among them, worked freely. Even the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wanted a country without B’Tselem (and without the High Court of Justice), but he never acted to bring that about.</p> \n<p>Present-day Israel not only wants a country without B’Tselem, it is working to bring that about. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the commanders of the Israel Defense Forces, which is quite a brutal army of occupation, “Peace Now.” Clearly he would have fired most of them if he could have. If the right-wing government has another term, steps will be taken.</p> \n<p>The interior minister is already working to disqualify the lawfully elected deputy mayor of Haifa merely because of his opinions. The public security minister finds his only comfort, in light of his embarrassing series of failures, in persecuting human rights activists. The traffic police revoke the driver’s license of a left-wing activist solely because of his opinions, as the court determined in the case of Guy Hirschfeld; Ben-Gurion international airport deports tourists just because of their opinions. Without the frog realizing it, the water it’s cooking in is getting gradually hotter and its fate is known.</p> \n<p>The great persecution has begun, slowly and with no one to hinder it. The methods will be copied from those used against the Palestinians. Those worked well. Next in line are the Palestinian Israelis and after them the Jewish leftists. Wait for the arrests. No one will stop them.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tuesday’s planned visit by Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini – leader of the radical right-wing League party, which is known for its hardline stance on refugees (he recently prevented a ship full of asylum seekers, including children and pregnant women, from docking) – has once again sparked discussion about Israel’s increasingly close ties with right-wing governments in Europe and outside it. These relationships, which Israel is cultivating, raise a rather banal issue relating to the space between realpolitik and traditional diplomacy.</p> \n<p>It goes without saying that Israel – which, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rightly says, is enjoying one of its best moments ever from the standpoint of foreign relations – can’t be too choosy about its friends. And that’s especially true at a time when many governments in the Western world are characterized by anti-liberal views.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Communist, separatist, nationalist: What you need to know about Italian strongman Matteo Salvini&nbsp;■ Italy's far-right leader Salvini: 'I don't have to justify myself every time I go to Israel'</p> \n<p>Today, Israel has excellent relations even with governments (like those in Poland, Hungary and Austria) that combine the seemingly contradictory characteristics of anti-Semitic attitudes and admiration for the Jewish state. How is it possible to reconcile this contradiction?</p> \n<p>One explanation is that the term “anti-Semitic” also includes hatred for Arabs, who, due to Muslim migration, to a large extent represent for today’s Europe what the Jews did in the past. Another explanation is connected to the success of Zionism, or, alternatively, its rotten fruits.</p> \n<p>After all, distinguishing the new Jew from the old, Diaspora Jew was a cornerstone of Zionism. The right-wing Zionist ideologue Ze’ev Jabotinsky summarized this view when he promised, “We will expunge from that figure [the Jew] all those traits that are so typical of the Yid and imbue it with all the special qualities that it so typically lacked. … Since the Yid is ugly and sickly and devoid of grandeur, we will grant the ideal image of the Hebrew masculine beauty.” The irony of history is that the very success of this vision, which sought to distinguish the Hebrew from the Jew, helps us understand how admiration for Israel can go hand in hand with loathing for Jews.</p> \n<p>The combination of pro-Israeli sentiment with a tinge of anti-Semitism is also related to Christian theology, which holds that the church is the true nation of Israel, having replaced the sinful Jews, who deserve to be hated for bringing about Jesus’ murder. On the other hand, the fact that protestant Christian sects primarily ascribe importance to the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, in both of which Israel is portrayed positively, has contributed to philo-Semitic Christian views.</p> \n<p>Thus, in the Christian world there’s a blurry border between anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism, which is especially evident among evangelical supporters of Israel. They work for Israel’s welfare, but out of a desire to thereby hasten Judgment Day, the war of Gog and Magog, at the end of which Jesus will return and the Jews will have to either convert or die.</p> \n<p>So how should we understand evangelicals – as philo-Semitic or anti-Semitic? Or perhaps both? Menachem Begin, the prime minister under whom ties with evangelicals began to be forged, proposed that we wait to resolve this issue until the Messiah comes and benefit from their support until then. Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is following in his footsteps on this issue.</p> \n<p>But it’s a mistake to think about this issue only in the context of the Zionist right. Actually, the Zionist flirtation with anti-Semitic bad actors dates back to Zionism’s founding father, Theodor Herzl.</p> \n<p>Herzl believed that people with anti-Semitic views would help realize his dream because of their desire to get the Jews out of their own countries. He also sought to exploit their belief in “Jewish power,” which ostensibly rules the world.</p> \n<p>Thus, for instance, after a Turkish slaughter of the Armenians in the late 19th century, he promised the sultan that he would work to improve Turkey’s image in the European press, which was controlled by Jewish tycoons. He thereby hoped to persuade the sultan to support Zionism.</p> \n<p>Even a liberal Zionist like Chaim Weizmann met several times with Mussolini the fascist – before the latter hooked up with the Nazis – to try to get him to support Zionism. And from the other end of the Zionist spectrum, we have the attempt by Avraham Stern, leader of the right-wing pre-state underground Lehi, to create an alliance with the Nazis against the British, whom he viewed as the chief enemy of the national project.</p> \n<p>The relationships Israel’s government is forging today with right-wing governments, despite their anti-Semitic opinions, also stem from their shared conservative worldviews. But it’s important to recognize that the link between Zionism and anti-Semitism wasn’t created under Netanyahu; it also derived from the fact that Zionism was a marginal movement seeking allies anywhere they could be found.</p> \n<p>Additionally, it’s important to understand that this supposedly new European phenomenon – governments that combine anti-Semitic messages with sympathy for Israel – is actually rooted in deep theological and historical undercurrents, and doesn’t just stem from what has been termed a “crisis of liberalism.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Sara Netanyahu’s trip to Guatemala marks a new low in corrupt values. It reflects a spirit of the last days of Pompeii, conduct reminiscent of Marie Antoinette.</p> \n<p>This is not “pettiness,” “persecution” or “gossip.” Mrs. Netanyahu has no official position or diplomatic standing. She is not a civil servant, not subject to Civil Service regulations and isn’t meant to be sent on diplomatic missions. As the wife of the Israeli prime minister, she has certain ceremonial obligations. It’s also her right to accompany him on his domestic or foreign trips. But an independent trip by the prime minister’s wife, at the state’s expense, is unprecedented.</p> \n<p>We’re talking about a week-long trip to a small, distant country that has no diplomatic influence, no economic relevance and no effect on Israel or Diaspora Jewry. The only reason for the disproportionately warm attitude towards Guatemala from the Balfour Street gentry is its decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>During the investigation of Case 4000, the Bezeq-Walla case, family associates argued that Sarah Netanyahu couldn’t be charged with accepting bribes because “she’s not a civil servant.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu often asks to, “Focus on me and not on Sara, she’s a private person.” But on her last birthday he suddenly introduced her as an influential diplomatic factor (“she opens doors”). And here she is, being sent on a state mission by the Foreign Ministry, which, incidentally, the prime minister is in charge of, and shockingly refuses to yield, even though he recently also named himself defense minister (a scandal that deserves separate treatment).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: 'Sara's top aide in New York': The businessman police say connected Elovitch to the Netanyahus&nbsp;■&nbsp;Netanyahu’s played the victim so long, he’s forgotten it’s an act</p> \n<p>At the beginning of the week I contacted the Prime Minister’s Office, which also deals with his wife’s affairs. I asked about the purpose of her trip, what the schedule was, how much it cost and which budget was paying for it and by virtue of what status she was making this trip. On issues of public perception or mere good taste I didn’t find it proper to bother the prime minister’s bureau.</p> \n<p>In response, I was told that, “The wife of the Guatemalan president, Mrs. Morales, invited Mrs. Netanyahu to visit as part of an official delegation organized by the Foreign Ministry. Funding for accommodations and transport in Guatemala is by the Guatemalan government. The Foreign Ministry and other government ministries annually fund flights by Israeli citizens, including artists, writers and sportsmen, to represent Israel. The wife of the president noted in her official invitation that this is a historic visit that will symbolize the friendship between the countries and strengthen their mutual commitment.</p> \n<p>“As part of the visit, the prime minister’s wife and the Israeli delegation were invited to attend official events relating to drinking water and assistance to victims of natural disasters, this in light of the assistance Israel gave Guatemala after the volcano eruption half a year ago. At these events additional Israeli state aid will be announced, including medical aid to children. The delegation’s visit constitutes another step in strengthening the special relations between the two states, and is of great importance on the diplomatic level.”</p> \n<p>It is important to stress that Israel is not the United States, where the status and role of the first lady is established in law and protocol. Our “first lady” is the president’s wife; Sara Netanyahu is not Melania Trump or Michele Obama. If she and her husband want her to be that, they must change the form of government here and not just exploit the current weakness of Israeli democracy to impose their desires.</p> \n<p>This outrageous trip is taking place because a host of gatekeepers aren’t doing their jobs; we have a fawning coalition, a fearful opposition, a tired public and media outlets that can’t keep up with the pace of the scandals. One would hope that the state comptroller will take the time to examine the Guatemala file, preferably as soon as possible, if only to save Israeli taxpayers from footing the bill for future trips by the Netanyahu family’s “private person.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>For now, the Knesset rejected the flagship project of Culture and Sports Minister Miri Regev, when about two weeks ago it removed the so-called “cultural loyalty bill” from its agenda. Nevertheless, the cultural order of the day issued by commissar Regev has been taken to heart and the cogwheels of the intimidation, silencing and cooperation machinery are turning on their own.</p> \n<p>Last week the chairman of the national lottery Mifal Hapayis, Avigdor Yitzhaki, volunteered to act as a censor, asking the mayor of the Arab town of Kabul to cancel the play “Palestine, Year Zero” by Einat Weizman. The self-appointed censor offered Mayor Salah Rihan two children’s plays instead of the one he sought to cancel. “Palestine, Year Zero” first made headlines in 2016, when it was to take part in Acre’s fringe theater festival, and Regev instructed her ministry officials to check whether the play conveys any messages of incitement. Regev’s instruction was harshly criticized and in the end it was approved and even received the ministry’s support.</p> \n<p>Mifal Hapayis assisted in production of the play as part of the Acre festival and also supported it in a festival devoted to plays in Arabic.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, even without Regev’s direct intervention, it turns out that even the head of a lottery organization can intervene in Israel’s cultural life and silence others for political reasons. But it’s not Yitzhaki’s job to intervene in plays presented in Mifal Hapayis centers, even if the right-wing people whose messenger he is demand this directly or indirectly. Yitzhaki was selected for his job to promote culture and art by means of lottery income and not to censor plays, certainly not when he acts contrary to the decisions of the artistic committee acting in his name.</p> \n<p>Even without the cultural loyalty law, it’s difficult to assess the damage the Netanyahu government is causing by its incitement and its racist and divisive style, leveraged by nationalistic legislation, led by the nation-state law, which enshrines Jewish superiority and Arab inferiority. A direct line runs from the ritual conducted by the members of the Afula City Council three weeks ago when they took an oath to “maintain the Jewish character” of the city, to the attempt by the interior minister, backed by the prime minister, to block the appointment of a Hadash city councilman as deputy mayor of Haifa, to the approval of an expansion of the Acceptance Committees Law to communities of up to 700 families, to the disqualifying of a play. And these examples are only from the last month.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to know what’s worse: the destruction of culture that is the inevitable outcome of silencing others, or the destruction of Israel’s social fabric by encouraging informants, harm to minorities and spontaneous shows of “loyalty” by those who are not even under the authority of the culture minister. Either way, the play “Palestine, Year Zero” must be staged as originally, rightly intended.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Unlike other voices in the media, I suggest we believe the words of messianic leaders like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah. In these two we’ve got leaders well versed in the occult.</p> \n<p>“There is more here than meets the eye,” Netanyahu told the media at the beginning of the campaign to destroy the tunnels that Hezbollah has dug into Israel. Earlier, in promoting the calm vis-&agrave;-vis Hamas in Gaza and with the departure of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu hinted at Israel’s security challenges, ones that demand sacrifice.</p> \n<p>Across the border, Nasrallah has repeatedly said he ultimately hopes to die a martyr’s death. Anyone with those aspirations has no intention of resting on his laurels or retiring to religious studies like a yeshiva student. Anyone with such faith will take it to its ultimate conclusion until he ascends to heaven in a storm. This way he’ll ensure he’s remembered as a shahid in the Shi’ite pantheon of martyrs, and his grave will be a pilgrimage site attracting the entire Shi’ite world.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Hezbollah's attack tunnels prove Nasrallah has cracked Israel's DNA | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;What does Hezbollah want? | Opinion</p> \n<p>In recent years Nasrallah has repeated that in the next confrontation his soldiers will be ordered to capture the Galilee. This wasn’t just something he said to raise morale. He surely knows in great detail about the attack tunnels reaching into Israel, not to mention his organization’s plans. More than Nasrallah being tethered to the ayatollahs, it’s the other way around, seeing that the messianic Shi’ite doctrine in 16th-century Iran was crafted in part by Shi’ite scholars who had immigrated to Iran and took up senior positions there.</p> \n<p>Shi’ite messianism these days is confronted by Judeo-Christian messianism. Netanyahu, though not a religious person, is infused with messianic beliefs. He sees himself as the bearer of a historic mission to save the Jewish people living in Zion. He and the right wing are tightly linked to the messianic right in the United States the ultra-nationalist right in Europe.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu obtained his sense of shouldering a historic mission at home. Things you learn in childhood are etched into your soul forever. “We must realize that there is a deep cultural disparity that separates us and the Arabs,” Prof. Benzion Netanyahu told Haaretz in an interview many years ago.</p> \n<p>He said that “Zionism, in essence, is a Western movement, it’s a movement living on the border with the East but always facing West. In some respect Zionism has always been a forward post of the West in the East. It is still today an outpost opposing the East’s natural tendencies to penetrate the West and subjugate it …. Arabs see us as a foreign implant …. They feel we endanger their culture and religion as well as the structure of their society and regime. This is why they mark us as a target.”</p> \n<p>In his meetings with Western leaders, Benjamin often repeats his father’s words, stressing even more strongly Israel’s holy mission. As he told his soulmate Viktor Orban during the Hungarian prime minister’s visit to Israel, “by being here, in this county here, at the front line of the battle against radical Islam, in many ways Israel is defending Europe.”</p> \n<p>In a recording that leaked from a meeting with European leaders in Budapest, Netanyahu can be heard repeating his mantra about how Israel is “the one Western country that defends European values” in a very benighted region.</p> \n<p>Indeed, this is a very benighted region. The source of darkness is a life lived in myths of the past. There is an abundant past in this region, and from too much past it’s hard to see a future. The question is whether a countdown has started to another destructive war with its blood, sweat and tears.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son Yair called left-wing organizations and politicians &quot;traitors&quot; in a Facebook post on Monday. The post also chided members of the Israeli media and people who sympathized with Palestinians for acting against &quot;Jewish interests.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu wrote that &quot;Now finally this word is allowed, I’ll say what everyone in the country knows. Left-wing NGOs funded by foreign and hostile governments, the politicians on the left and media people who always side with the enemy and always against Jewish interests, whose hearts are hardened against victims of terror, settlers or victims of infiltrators, and on the other hand whose hearts are full of compassion for every Arab rioter wounded on the Gaza border – they are the traitors!”</p> \n<p>A few hours later, Netanyahu senior wrote on his Facebook page that he “rejects the use of the term ‘traitor’ by any side in the political debate. Unfortunately, others use this word all the time. Ever since the submarines investigation, in which the prime minister was never a suspect,&nbsp;Ehud Barak, left-wing activists and others accuse Prime Minister Netanyahu of ‘treason.’ The media has not said a word about that. Apparently they believe the word ‘traitor’ can be used as long as it’s directed against Prime Minister Netanyahu.”</p> \n<p>Earlier Monday, Netanyahu testified in court in his libel suit against&nbsp;social activist Abie Binyamin, using words that earned him a rebuke from the judge.</p> \n<p>“Abie Binyamin is the scum of the human race,” Netanyahu said, to which the judge responded: “Watch the language. There’s no place for such statements.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is suing Binyamin for 140,000 shekels ($37,378) for posting on Facebook in August 2016 that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had asked the Mossad to issue his son a passport under a false name for security reasons, “to protect his licentious son who goes around the world, so he’ll have a false identity.”</p> \n<p>Judge Avi Shalev suggested that any damages awarded would be donated to an apolitical organization. However, Netanyahu turned down the idea and said: “I want a harsh verdict and proper compensation.”</p> \n<p>Before entering the courtroom, Netanyahu was met by some protesters in the hallway who heckled him and called out “Bibi is a thief,” and “Bibi is a traitor.” Netanyahu gave them the finger in response.</p> \n<p>Binyamin also wrote in his August 2016 post that the passport “became an exercise in fraud by the Netanyahu family to raise taxes, launder money and receive payments from all kinds of interested parties.” After Binyamin was threatened with a lawsuit, he erased the post.</p> \n<p>Binyamin claimed in his defense that he is not an investigator or a journalist and so the post in question was not subject to the rules of journalism, and that it consisted of news reports. He apologized for the post in the past, and in court yesterday he apologized again and said the source from which he took the information might not be able to prove it true.</p>",

The plans had been opposed by Netanyahu’s predecessor at the post, Avigdor Lieberman, over concerns that going public would inevitably lead to classified national security information leaking out.</p> \n<p>Under the plan, a stake of between 25% and 30% of IAI will be floated on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.

Minutes from the meeting released on Monday showed members voted 4-1 to raise rate to 0.25% from 0.1%.</p> \n<p>The rate hike was unusual not only because it was the first in seven years but because it was done after Karnit Flug had stepped down as governor and Amir Yaron had not yet taken over. However, the minutes showed that the committee concluded that Israel’s macro environment required immediate action.</p> \n<p>“They assessed that the economic considerations are the decisive factors in reaching the interest rate decision, and not the fact that the Bank is in a period of transition between governors,” the minutes said. The one member who opposed the hike countered that the situation was “borderline” and felt that the move should be led by the new governor, the minutes showed.

In reaching its conclusion, the ISA noted that Discount had reduced its stake further to 26% last month and that the institutional investors who had bought its shares now had two seats on Super-Sol’s board. The decision clears the way for the approval of a shelf prospectus Super-Sol has sought.

        "text":["<p>It is worth taking note of the words of the Hanukkah songs that families sing along with their little children around the menorah, after the kids sing them endlessly in their preschools and in the lower grades in school, too. </p> \n<p>Let us start with Ma’oz Tzur (Rock of Ages), probably the most popular of Hanukkah songs, which opens with the words: “O’ Fortress, Rock of my salvation, unto thee it is becoming to give praise.” Nonreligious children also know it by heart and sing the plea to God as our fortress, refuge and salvation, the only one who is deserving of praise, with full intent. </p> \n<p>Not exactly something appropriate for the atheistic worldview, but no big deal. Tradition and all that. But then the song continues: “Let my house of prayer be restored, and I will there offer thee thanksgivings.” Those singing are pleading to God to rebuild the Temple, and there they will sacrifice thanksgiving offerings to him. These words are in contradiction to my views and don’t sit well in my mouth – but let’s let that go too, it’s a holiday, etc. </p> \n<p>And then we reach the next line: “When thou shalt have prepared a slaughter of the blaspheming foe.” Imagine the children singing these words in their high-pitched, clear voices, the song of little angels. Imagine the parents singing in their thundering voices, full of tribal excitement – also because at this point the song begins a rousing melodic turning point. </p> \n<p>What do the words say? What, in fact, are we singing here? What is the “slaughter?” It is simply a massacre. “When thou shalt have prepared a slaughter,” is in other words when the Blessed Holy One will cut off the seed of Amalek, erase his memory from the face of the earth. No less than a massacre, like a big pogrom, like an “Aktion.” The massacre of Amalek. Of all the enemies of Israel. Not just the enemy’s soldiers, but everyone: Children, women, civilians, elderly. </p> \n<p>The families of Israel gather on Hanukkah, religious and secular, around the Hanukkah menorahs, and cheerfully declare their watchful expectations for a massacre / pogrom / Aktion to be carried out against the enemies of the people, and with an emphasis on slaughtering the “barking foe,” in other words, the enemy that brazenly voices (like a barking dog) words of contempt toward Jewish belief.</p> \n<p>This is in short, a joyous call by the entire family for a jihadist religious war. It is so sweet and heartwarming to think about it that it arouses a desire to gorge on jelly donuts and latkes. When we talk about slaughter and jihad, we want sugar in our bloodstream.</p> \n<p>The first stanza, the one everyone sings, ends with the words: “Then I will complete with song and psalm the dedication of the altar.” More words of praise and glory to God who slaughters and a promise to make sacrifices on the altar of the Temple. Imagine in your hearts this song being sung in the Temple itself, broadcast live during prime time on television, including the offering of the sacrifices. The entire people, and commercial television in particular, have something to aspire to. </p> \n<p>And what about “these candles?” The song in which the entire House of Israel thanks this selfsame slaughtering God, thirsty for the blood of victims, for “the wars and the salvations.” This is a song that incites war gaily – and not war in the singular, but in the plural, wars. When it’s good, it’s good, and we want more. The wars are the salvation, they are the redemption. And the gratitude for them (what would we have done without them?) does not apply just to the wars of the past but also to the wars that will come “soon and in our times,” in the present: “In those days, as in this time.” </p> \n<p>What is war? It is to drive out the darkness. It is: “We have come to banish the darkness,” which always raises morale. “Each person is a small light, and together we are an unwavering light.” What is the individual? He is a small light. To massacre, the individual must surrender his or her independence and merge into the masses. These are the beliefs and these are the values of Hanukkah songs. Happy holidays.</p>",

One of the sources said Ayers would return to &quot;America First Policies,&quot; a combative group that he helped found before joining Pence in the White House.</p> \n<p>Several hours after the news broke, Trump essentially confirmed that Ayers would not get the job but offered few other details.&nbsp;&quot;I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda,&quot; Trump said in a message on Twitter, referring to his slogan &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; &quot;I will be making a decision soon!&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ayers wrote earlier on Twitter: &quot;I will be departing at the end of the year but will work with the #MAGA team to advance the cause.&quot;&nbsp;One source said Trump had sought a two-year commitment from Ayers but that he was unable to agree to that. Ayers, the father of young triplets, was willing to serve only until the spring of 2019 for family reasons, an administration official said earlier.</p> \n<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp; A source familiar with Mnuchin's thinking said Mnuchin sees his role at Treasury as best suited to help the president and feels very committed to remaining in his current position.&nbsp;A spokesman for Meadows had no comment on the matter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>With Ayers out of the running, it is unclear who will take over the top administrative post in the West Wing at a time Trump has been weakened by Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives in congressional elections last month.</p> \n<p>Trump will decide on his new chief of staff by the end of the year, the sources said. The president said on Saturday that Kelly would leave the post by year's end.</p> \n<p>Trump brought Kelly in last year to restore order to his White House, but has clashed repeatedly with the retired Marine Corps general in recent months. The two men were no longer on speaking terms, according to one source with direct knowledge of the situation.</p> \n<p>The constant staff upheaval at all levels has left Trump's White House grappling to try to advance his policies. Many of the resignations have come under pressure.</p> \n<p>Trump now faces House probes into his businesses and most contentious policies, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating possible collusion between Trump's election campaign team and Russian officials in 2016. Trump, who has denied collusion, calls the probe a &quot;witch hunt.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ayers has advised a series of Republican governors and as Pence's chief of staff, has run one of the most effective political teams in Washington.</p> \n<p>But critics questioned whether the young operative had the kind of experience needed to deal with the internal strife that has often engulfed the Trump White House.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>At last week’s rally protesting violence against women, two MCs stood on the central stage directing the event– one a Hebrew speaker and the other an Arabic speaker. The back and forth between the two was accepted as natural was a remark by the Arabic speaker about “12 Palestinian women who were murdered since the start of the year.”</p> \n<p>Equally natural was the fact that the crowd in Tel Aviv’s Rabin Square had a noticeable presence of Arab women, including devout ones in traditional garb. Anyone present at the rally couldn’t help but feel the change in the air: Arab women holding their heads up high – and not just young, modern ones, but women from all sectors of Israeli Arab society.</p> \n<p>Half of the women killed in Israel this year were Israeli Arabs even though they make up just 20% of the country’s population. The death of Yara Ayoub, a 16-year-old Israeli Arab, was one of two murders that sparked the protests.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How anti-femicide protest is uniting women in Israel's Arab and Jewish communities &lt;&lt;</p> \n<p>As Naila Awwad, director of the Association of Women Against Violence, said: “The proportion of Arab women murdered is double their share of the population. Ten of the 24 women murdered this year were Arabs.”</p> \n<p>A figure like that makes it difficult to talk about an improvement in the status of Israeli Arab women. Yet it is impossible not to notice what is happening: Middle class Arab women are making huge strides, and the numbers show just how big those changes are.</p> \n<p>The most prominent of those numbers, according to the yearbook of the Van Leer Institute, is the sharp decline in the birthrate for Arab women. The number of births per woman fell from 4.3 in 2001 to 3.1 in 2013, narrowing the gap with Jewish women.</p> \n<p>Not counting Haredi women, who have a very high birthrate, other Jewish women have on average 2.6 children. Discounting Bedouin women, with their very high birthrate, the average for Arab women in Israel is now less than three. In the Galilee region, the rate is the same 2.6 as for it is for non-Haredi Jewish women.</p> \n<p>The decline in the birthrate reflects the rise of the Israeli Arab middle class and the emergence of large numbers of young couples who think in terms of career and standard of living. They want to obtain an education, work at an interesting and well-paying job, own their own home and have fewer children.</p> \n<p>One result has been the rise in the average age at which Arab women marry. Today it is 22 – four years younger than the average for non-Haredi Jewish women. The divorce rate is also rising and is approaching the Jewish rate. The percentage of Israeli Arab women over age 30 who have chosen to remain single has risen to 12%.</p> \n<p>The changes Israeli Arab women have undergone are nothing short of a social revolution.</p> \n<p>Hadas Fuchs, a research at the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies, found in her research published this year that the biggest change of all for Arab women in the workplace has been in education: 15% of all students in Israeli higher education are Arab women, much larger than their share of the country’s population.</p> \n<p>They are pursuing degrees at a rate 50% higher than the overall population and are disproportionately responsible for the doubling of the number of Arab students in higher education since the year 2000.</p> \n<p>Seventy percent of Arabs holding bachelor’s degrees are women; among Jews, women account for 60%.</p> \n<p>The education revolution extends to the high school level where girls dominate the matriculation (bagrut) exams among Arab students in engineering and science. The percentage of girls studying traditionally male pursuits in science in Arab high schools is dizzying: In computer sciences they account for 52% of all students, in electronics 55% and in mathematics 59%. In chemistry they account for no fewer than 70% of all Arab high school students in the field</p> \n<p>Not everything is rosy: Their test scores on international exams and the psychometric exam for university entrance are still lower than for Jewish students of both sexes.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Arab girls don’t pursue sciences after high school, opting for more traditionally female areas of study, such as teaching and paramedical studies. The rate of Arab women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) at university level is very low, which means they won’t be entering Israel’s high-tech sector in huge numbers.</p> \n<p>Even so, employment rates for Arab women, which have traditionally been very low, have broken through the 40% barrier this year for the first time ever. While that is still less than half the 82% rate for Jewish women, it represents a five percentage point increase in just one year.</p> \n<p>In the year 2001, the labor force participation rate for Israeli Arab women was just about 20%.</p> \n<p>That one-year increase is so enormous that it is hard to believe it’s true. But Fuchs predicted it a year earlier, based on the figures she had collected on women’s levels of education.</p> \n<p>The impact of a wise and important government policy is also evident here: Resolution 922, which has allocated 10 billion shekels ($2.7 billion) to the Arab society, has created wonders for Israeli society, Jews and Arabs alike.</p> \n<p>Iman Seif, who until recently was head of the Authority for the Economic Development of the Arab, Druze and Circassian Sectors at the Social Equality Ministry, says the revolution is due to a combination of government policy and the increasing willingness of Arab women to pursue careers.</p> \n<p>“Jews think of Arab women as traditional and fearful of leaving their villages to work. But in the Triangle region [of the Lower Galilee] there are hundreds of women who studied teaching but can’t find jobs in local schools. So every morning they get up at 5 and travel to the Negev to teach at Bedouin schools. These aren’t women afraid to leave the village,” he said.</p> \n<p>The improvement in the status of Arab women comes with dangers. In traditional Bedouin society in the Negev, where women are far more educated than men, the gender gap has created social tensions. Some warn that it may disrupt traditional society.</p> \n<p>The high homicide rate among Arab women may reflect some of those tensions. But last week’s rally shows that Arab women won’t be cowed. Indeed, they are the ones now leading Israeli Arab society forward economically and socially. The events at Rabin Square have made that clear.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The leader of the Hadash party on the Haifa city council, Raja Zaatry, is slated to be appointed deputy mayor. Interior Minister Arye Dery announced that he’s looking into how he can prevent the appointment, because he claims Zaatry supports terrorist organizations and anti-Israel boycotts. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed Dery’s position, saying at the start of the cabinet meeting that he had called Haifa Mayor Einat Kalisch Rotem and asked her “to cancel the appointment of a deputy mayor who supports Hezbollah and Hamas, which openly announce their intention of destroying Israel.”</p> \n<p>Zaatry was elected to the city council in a democratic election as a representative of the city’s Arab community and other voters who supported Hadash’s municipal ticket, known as the Haifa Front. He has spoken in the past in a manner not all Haifa residents would agree with, but he denies some of the statements attributed to him.</p> \n<p>“I’ll represent the city’s residents, Arabs and Jews, for the sake of a dignified life, true partnership, social and distributive justice and ethical propriety,” he said. “I’m not a member of either Hamas or Hezbollah.”</p> \n<p>Dery, a convicted criminal and serial suspect, wants to prevent Zaatry’s appointment as deputy mayor because of his political views. The prime minister, as usual, is trying to ride the wave of demonization and wink at members of his Likud party’s central committee. But Dery and Netanyahu aren’t alone. They have received a tailwind from the political center, which is nothing but the nationalist right in disguise.</p> \n<p>Yair Lapid, chairman of the Yesh Atid party, hastened to jump on the bandwagon of incitement by tweeting, “The Labor Party’s decision to appoint a declared supporter of Hezbollah and BDS, who has compared Zionism to the Islamic State, is complete madness. Zionist Union must order Kalisch Rotem to immediately cancel this agreement, which links it to the worst of Israel’s enemies.”</p> \n<p>Kulanu party chairman Moshe Kahlon said, “There’s no place in public administration for a person who, in his behavior, represents inflammatory views against Israel.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu and Dery, egged on by the Israeli political center, reflect the current Israeli zeitgeist, in which democracy means the tyranny of the majority and riding roughshod over minorities. Zaatry is a legitimate representative, even if his views displease the interior minister. His appointment as deputy mayor is important for Haifa; it is a harbinger of integration and a shared life in Israel’s most tolerant mixed city.</p> \n<p>Thus, one must admire the city’s new mayor, who stood behind the appointment and declared, “The Arab community is an important part of our city, and we must respect the will of its voters. We’ll also demand that they, to the same degree, respect the will of the rest of Haifa’s voters, including those on the right.” We can only hope she will withstand the pressure being exerted on her and refuse to cancel the appointment.</p>",

Most companies in Tel Aviv must currently report in Hebrew, with the exception of high-tech and dual-listed firms that are permitted to use English. The new proposal offers the option to all businesses and is meant to bring Tel Aviv in line with leading global exchanges. “Giving the option to report in English is expected to remove the language barrier and further open the Israeli market to the world,” said Anat Guetta, chair of the Israel Securities Authority. If it is accepted and the law is amended, companies making an initial public offering in Tel Aviv could choose English, while those already listed would need board and shareholder approval to switch languages.

Sandoz will start selling the pre-filled epinephrine syringes, called SYMJEPI, in the first quarter of 2019 at a wholesale price of $250 for a two-pack of 0.3-milligram injections, Novartis said. The news comes a month after Teva launched a generic version of EpiPen at the wholesale price of $300 for a pack of two auto-injectors – the same price as Mylan’s generic version of its own product. Two years ago, Mylan’s EpiPen sales practices sparked public outrage in the U.S. as consumers saw the price rise six-fold to $600 in less than a decade. Mylan launched its generic version at half that list price in 2016. Teva shares ended down 1.75% at 73 shekels ($19.56).

        "text":["<p>Eager for a historic trade agreement, U.S. President Donald Trump is claiming done deals with China that aren’t measuring up to the hype.</p> \n<p>He describes last week’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as “extraordinary” and a “big leap forward.” China, however, has provided few details and little confirmation about what it actually agreed to do in regard to buying more American products and addressing the Trump administration’s assertions that Beijing steals American technology.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed that China had agreed to reduce or eliminate its 40 percent tariffs on cars imported from the U.S. His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, acknowledged no deal had been “signed and sealed and delivered yet.”</p> \n<p>The statements marked a week when Trump also claimed without evidence for a second time that Paris protesters were chanting support for him, grossly overstated the costs of illegal immigration and derided U.S. weapons spending as crazy, despite earlier boasts about increasing the military budget.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Democratic Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ignored reality when she suggested the Pentagon has a hidden pot of $21 trillion that could help pay for “Medicare for All.” The total defense budget during the period in question only totaled $9 trillion.</p> \n<p>A look at the claims and the facts:</p> \n<p>PARIS</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France.” — tweet Saturday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Neither Associated Press journalists covering protests in the city nor any French television networks have shown evidence that supporters were chanting any slogans in support of Trump. The protests that began as a revolt against a gas tax increase have turned increasingly violent and France imposed exceptional security measures Saturday to prevent a repeat of rioting a week ago.</p> \n<p>JERUSALEM</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “We quickly moved the American embassy to Jerusalem and we got it built.”— remarks Thursday at Hanukkah event.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Nothing’s been built yet. The Trump administration designated an existing U.S. consular facility in Jerusalem for the U.S. Embassy, retrofitting some offices and holding a big dedication ceremony in May. The U.S. has yet to identify a permanent site for the new embassy, a process that is expected to take years. The State Department has estimated that constructing a new embassy would cost more than $500 million.</p> \n<p>TARIFFS</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.” — tweet Sunday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Nearly a week later, it’s still not clear if this will happen. When asked about the matter, Kudlow would only say that he hoped China would remove its tariffs on U.S. autos. “We don’t yet have a specific agreement on that, but I will just tell you, as an involved participant, we expect those tariffs to go to zero,” he told reporters on Monday. Pressed again Tuesday, Kudlow told “Fox and Friends” that he expected China to move quickly on removing the tariffs “if they’re serious about this.”</p> \n<p>“I think it’s coming, OK?” he said. “It hasn’t been signed and sealed and delivered yet.”</p> \n<p>The White House’s confusing and conflicting words have left Wall Street skeptical.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t seem like anything was actually agreed to at the dinner and White House officials are contorting themselves into pretzels to reconcile Trump’s tweets (which seem if not completely fabricated then grossly exaggerated) with reality,” JPMorgan told investors in a trading note.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, a Chinese official said that China will “immediately implement the consensus reached by the two sides on farm products, cars and energy,” but did not address the auto tariffs specifically or provide any additional details.</p> \n<p>Trump has cast doubt on whether a firm agreement had been reached, tweeting Tuesday that his administration will determine “whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible.”</p> \n<p>___</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.” — tweet Tuesday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Trump seems to be claiming that tariffs are some kind of a membership fee for foreign companies to trade in the U.S. economy.</p> \n<p>They’re not. Tariffs are a tax, per Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.</p> \n<p>The costs of this tax are borne by U.S. consumers and businesses, often in the form of higher prices. Foreign companies may end up selling fewer goods and services if the United States imposes high tariffs. So they pay a price, too.</p> \n<p>In some cases, the tariffs exist to protect industries that are vital for national security. Or, the tariffs exist to retaliate against the trade practices of other countries. Or, they might protect politically connected companies.</p> \n<p>In the past, White House aides have insisted that Trump’s tariffs are a negotiating ploy. Yet the president offered no such qualifications on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Tariffs are not seen as some easy way of generating massive wealth for an economically developed nation. After Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs earlier this year, the University of Chicago asked leading academic economists in March whether Americans would be better off because of import taxes. Not a single economist surveyed said the country would be wealthier.</p> \n<p>Nor do the budget numbers suggest they can come anywhere close to covering the costs of the federal government.</p> \n<p>Trump is correct that tariffs did generate $41.3 billion in tax revenues last budget year, according to the Treasury Department. But to put that in perspective, the federal budget exceeds $4.1 trillion.</p> \n<p>The taxes collected on imports were equal to about 1 percent of all federal spending.</p> \n<p>MEDICARE</p> \n<p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: ”$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions ‘could not be traced, documented, or explained.’ $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs (tilde)$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon. And that’s before our premiums.” — tweet Sunday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: Ocasio-Cortez is generally correct to suggest that one way of paying for the huge cost of “Medicare for All” would be to cut spending elsewhere. But she is wrong to suggest that there’s pot of misspent defense dollars that could cover the new health care expenses. The New York Democrat also misrepresents the findings of an academic study that found the $21 trillion in Pentagon errors to be accounting “adjustments,” not a tally of actual money wasted.</p> \n<p>The study by Mark Skidmore, an economist at Michigan State University and Catherine Austin Fitts, a former assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, did find $21 trillion in Pentagon transactions from 1998 to 2015 that could not be verified. Their study is a cited in a Nation article retweeted in part by Ocasio-Cortez, even though that article makes clear that not “all of this $21 trillion was secret or misused funding ... the plugs are found on both the positive and the negative sides of the ledger, thus potentially netting each other out.”</p> \n<p>Total defense spending from 1998 to 2015 was $9 trillion. That means defunding the military entirely would only cover a small portion of the estimated $32 trillion cost over 10 years for the “Medicare for All” legislation by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Ocasio-Cortez wrongly suggests that fixing Pentagon accounting errors would net 66 percent of costs.</p> \n<p>“What she was referencing was the total number of transactions that happened with DoD — there’s a lot of double and triple counting as money gets moved around in the department,” said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “All of that basically means is that those transactions don’t have a full trail,” akin to an employee who submits an expense report without providing all the receipts.</p> \n<p>“Just because you don’t have the proper audit trail for transactions doesn’t mean that those transactions are fraudulent,” Harrison said.</p> \n<p>David Norquist, the Pentagon’s comptroller, has attributed the accounting errors to the department’s older bookkeeping “systems that do not automatically pass data from one to the other.” He said in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in January that the errors do not amount to a pot of lost money. “I wouldn’t want the taxpayer to confuse that with the loss of something like a trillion dollars, it’s not. That wouldn’t be accurate,” Norquist said.</p> \n<p>MILITARY SPENDING</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!” — tweet Monday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: His criticism of U.S. weapons spending as “crazy” vastly overstates the amount spent on the arms race. It also is a sudden change of tone from his previous boasts about increased military spending.</p> \n<p>Trump’s statement appeared to confuse the total Defense Department budget with America’s investment in the missile defense systems and strategic nuclear weapons usually associated with the arms race. The Pentagon’s budget for 2019 totals about $716 billion, but that includes everything from health care and pay for service members to the costs of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The arms race is just a fraction of that amount, totaling about $10 billion this year for a wide range of missile defense and nuclear weapons programs.</p> \n<p>Until recently, Trump has bragged about his increase in military spending, railing about what he claims is previous administrations’ neglect of America’s armed forces. He said his administration is “rebuilding our military.” He has occasionally complained about specific programs such as Air Force One and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but his criticism was leveled at the defense contractors and focused on demanding savings.</p> \n<p>He has been far more supportive of the broader defense increases, and specifically has endorsed hikes for missile defense in line with a U.S. defense strategy that targets China and Russia as key adversaries.</p> \n<p>IMMIGRATION</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses (sic) 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!” — tweet Tuesday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: He’s inflating the cost of illegal immigration. Trump’s numbers left even those sympathetic to the president’s position scratching their heads.</p> \n<p>“I’m not sure where the president got his numbers,” said Dave Ray, a spokesman for the nonprofit group FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for lower immigration numbers.</p> \n<p>Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to questions about where the $250 billion estimate had come from.</p> \n<p>The Heritage Foundation, for instance, estimated in 2013 that households headed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally impose a net fiscal burden of around $54.5 billion per year.</p> \n<p>Even Trump himself has contradicted the figure. During his 2016 campaign, Trump claimed that illegal immigration cost the country more than $113 billion a year — less than half the number he tweeted Tuesday.</p> \n<p>That estimate appeared based on a paper by FAIR, which released an updated report in 2017 that claimed taxpayers “shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens” at the federal, state and local levels, with “a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664.”</p> \n<p>The $116 million figure included services such as health care and education, as well as spending on agencies including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, minus the $19 billon the group concluded those who are living in the country illegally pay in taxes. But it also included costs associated with the children of those immigrants in its tally, even when they are U.S. citizens. The estimate was criticized for making broad generalizations and other major methodological flaws.</p> \n<p>FENTANYL</p> \n<p>TRUMP, about his meeting with Xi at the gathering of leading rich and developing nations: “What he will be doing to fentanyl could be a game changer for the United States — and what fentanyl is doing to our country in terms of killing people. Because he’s agreed to put it at the highest level of crime in his country.” — aboard Air Force One on Dec. 1.</p> \n<p>TRUMP: “One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States. It will now be considered a ‘controlled substance.’” — tweet Wednesday.</p> \n<p>THE FACTS: That’s a misreading of what China agreed to do, at least as far as Chinese authorities are concerned.</p> \n<p>Fentanyl has been a controlled substance in China for years, according to Chinese regulators. All told, China has already put 25 variants of fentanyl, plus two precursors — chemicals used to make the drug — on its list of controlled substances, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said last week.</p> \n<p>Now, “China has decided to list all the fentanyl-like substances as controlled substances and start working to adjust related regulations,” says China’s foreign ministry.</p> \n<p>Doing so could help block China’s opioid merchants from skirting the law by inventing new chemical variants of fentanyl faster than regulators can declare them illegal.</p> \n<p>The standard approach of regulating drugs one by one has failed to control the proliferation of new and deadly synthetic opioids in the United States.</p> \n<p>In February, the U.S. said that for at least the next two years, all new chemical versions of fentanyl that weren’t already regulated would be classified as illegal controlled substances. U.S. officials had been urging China to do something similar.</p> \n<p>But China hasn’t always followed through on its promises. “Similar suggestions have failed to gain approval from Chinese regulators in the past,” the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said in a report last week that criticized China for “slow and ineffective” regulation of fentanyl.</p> \n<p>In 2016, U.S. negotiators thought they had secured an agreement with Beijing that China would target U.S.-bound exports of substances that were illegal in the United States, even if they weren’t illegal in China, but Beijing never implemented the policy, according to the commission, a group formed by the U.S. Congress to monitor economic relations with China.</p> \n<p>China’s new approach could indeed be game changing, as Trump said. But so far there’s no timeline for implementation of the policy.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the Israeli company that is the world's largest generic drug firm, is suspected of being part of one of the biggest cartels in the history of the United States, according to a report on Sunday by the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>Teva is one of more than a dozen generic drug companies under investigation for price fixing and dividing up the market share for 300 generic drugs,&nbsp;the Washington Post said. It cited comments made to the newspaper by Joseph Nielsen, an assistant attorney general and antitrust investigator for the state of Connecticut.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The coordination was allegedly conducted using emails and text and WhatsApp messages — and at steak dinners, cocktail receptions and golf games involving senior executives from the pharmaceutical companies.</p> \n<p>The investigation was launched in 2016 when antitrust investigators in dozens of states examined suspected price-fixing of just two drugs, but the investigation expanded rapidly and now includes 47 states. The prices of many generic drugs, including older ones, began to soar in 2013 and 2014, sometimes by thousands of percent. One of the most extreme examples cited by the Post was that of a long-standing asthma drug, albuterol, the price of which jumped by over 3,400%.</p> \n<p>The drug is sold by Mylan and Indian generic firm Sun. Mylan, and its president, Rajiv Malik, are said to be major suspects in the case. Malik is reportedly suspected of personal involvement in price-fixing. Shares of Mylan were dual-listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange from 2015 until February of this year.</p> \n<p>Apparently, two senior executives from one of the firms, Heritage, who pleaded guilty to price fixing in a separate case, have turned state’s evidence. Prosecutors appear to be hoping that many of the companies will reach plea agreements and pay huge fines. According to the Post, among the 16 companies accused are some of the biggest names in generic drugs, including Mylan, Teva, Sun and Dr. Reddy’s.</p> \n<p>Mylan denied the charges. Teva, Sun and Dr. Reddy’s did not respond to the Post's requests for comment. In a court filing, Teva said allegations of a price-fixing conspiracy “are entirely conclusory and devoid of any facts.”</p>",

Police said they were investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Asked about the incident at a news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also interior minister, said he would do everything to stop such acts of &quot;repugnant anti-Semitism&quot;.

Fifteen were deported to Auschwitz in 1944 and died either there or in an unknown place.&nbsp;The other five were among the 335 Italian men and boys, including 75 Jews, killed in the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome in March 1944 by occupying Nazis. They were murdered as a reprisal for the killing of 33 German policemen by partisans. On Monday morning, a gaping hole remained where the stones were.</p> \n<p>&quot;This is beyond vandalism. This is a deliberate attempt to deface memory,&quot; said Ylenja Lucaselli, a parliamentarian of the of the right-wing Brothers of Italy party.</p> \n<p>The writing on each stone started with the words &quot;Here lived&quot; followed by the name of the person, the date of deportation or arrest and the place and date of death, if known.</p> \n<p>The project to place such stones throughout Europe where victims of the Holocaust either lived or worked was started by German artist Gunter Demning in 1992.</p> \n<p>Adachiara Zevi, a Jewish community leader and head of the group that places the commemorative stones around Italy, said they are commonly known as &quot;stumbling stones,&quot; because they are meant to provoke thought.</p> \n<p>Last year, vandals damaged about 70 Jewish graves at Rome's main cemetery.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>December 20 will mark two years since the murder of Wijdan Abu Hamid from the Druze village of Kisra-Sumei in the western Galilee. Abu Hamid, 17 years old at the time, was stabbed to death in a park near her home, and her classmate’s murder trial, also 17 at the time of the murder, is currently underway.</p> \n<p>Then too, the murder of a young woman, a high school student, in the middle of the day only a few dozen meters from her home, shocked not only her quiet village – but Arab society as a whole. With wall-to-wall condemnation from women’s organizations, local rallies in the town and in schools, and widespread protests against violence in general and violence against women in particular – then too there was a sense of awakening.</p> \n<p>Today, two years after the murder, Wijdan’s father, Bahzad Abu Hamid, admits that despite all the empathy back then, he and his family have remained almost alone and the wound is still bleeding. Abu Hamid is present at every court session and to follow all the details, but the uproar in the days after the murder, which created a feeling of solidarity and of a shared fate, has ceased. The murders, however, haven’t.</p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, Bahzad visited the home of Yara Ayoub in the village of Jish, only a half-hour drive from Kisra. “True, Yara’s murder has still not been solved and there are not any indictments, but the circumstances are quite similar: A young and innocent woman, a [high school] student, almost the same age, was murdered close to her home and the suspect is a young man too,” he told Haaretz this week.</p> \n<p>“I came to support the parents, but there was almost no way for me to comfort them. I know that they too will remain alone with the bleeding scar because nothing will bring back their daughter,” Abu Hamid said.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of women and men attended demonstrations across Israel on Tuesday to protest femicide and violence against women. The day of protest, which was also a national strike, was sparked by the recent uptick in women’s murders - 24 women murdered by family members in 2018, a 30 percent rise compared with previous years.</p> \n<p>Abu Hamid is following the public struggle, and he very much hopes that this time it will continue and produce real results: “At the time, I hoped that Wijdan would be the last, but I’m sorry that the situation is getting worse. Someone here needs to come to their senses – the government, police, religious leaders, the entire society – enough.”</p> \n<p>Powerful actions</p> \n<p>The question of how to continue and how to leverage the recent awakening in order to achieve results is keeping women’s organizations and activists in the Arab community busy. The response to Ayoub’s murder - along with that of 12-year-old Silvana Tsegai in Tel Aviv - and the protests these murders sparked throughout the country, symbolize a turning point in the Arab community too.</p> \n<p>The chairwoman of the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, MK Aida Touma-Sliman (Joint List), says that “the protest in the Arab community was a strong expression of a great deal of accumulated anger and frustration, which broke out with great force after the murder of Yara Ayoub. Civil society, along with the [Arab] leadership, must continue protesting in order to harness the entire public – including activities in schools and community centers for youths,” she said.</p> \n<p>“The women’s protests show that only powerful actions can create a new agenda,” Touma-Sliman added.</p> \n<p>Women’s organizations in the Arab community admit that they were surprised by the scope of the protests and the massive turnout. “The first support for the strike came from the Taibeh municipality,” Naila Awwad, director of the Association of Women Against Violence, said. Then the cities of Tira, Jaljulya, Kafr Bara and Kafr Qasem joined in too. The municipalities allowed women to strike without docking their pay, and the Higher Arab Monitoring Committee and mayors supported as well, she added. “In our eyes, this was another turning point, real action and not just slogans and statements, especially because about 60 percent of the workforce in local municipalities consists of women,” Awwad added.</p> \n<p>Awwad noted the organizing and demonstrations held during the week before the strike and on the day of the strike, some of which were not connected to women’s organizations, and said it was clear to these groups that the struggle must continue and that they needed a plan for action. The activists have yet to meet to evaluate the strike and discuss ways to continue the struggle, but it can be said that so far it has been an incredible success in terms of the number of participants and the number of activists involved, Awwad said.</p> \n<p>Manal Shalabi, a researcher and feminist activist who is the chairwoman of Ad’ar, an organization that opposes the murder of women, said that success will be measured from now on “by the perseverance to continue fighting and the determination to continue our social and community action and the work on the ground. It will also be measured through our ability to translate actions and protests into a work plan intended to protect women and girls.”</p> \n<p>A political base</p> \n<p>Women’s struggle in Arab society is seen as a fundamentally political struggle, too. During the last two weeks, the struggle and the news headlines focused on violence against women, but under the surface questions are rising.</p> \n<p>Haaretz has discovered that Arab women’s organizations demanded that representatives from Jewish settlements in the West Bank not participate in the central rally in Tel Aviv, for instance. “Our call was clear and unambiguous – we are not asking the heads of the settlements to join in the struggle and declare a strike in the settlements,” Awwad said. “Those who occupy and oppress another people – in this case the Palestinian people – cannot and do not have any right to be part of the struggle for women’s rights.”</p> \n<p>The fight for women’s rights does not come at the expense of the battle for human rights, and there is no room for any repression in the feminist battle, which is political, Awwad added.</p> \n<p>The Balad party, part of the Joint List, released a statement this week, saying it is impossible to separate women’s struggle against violence and the struggle against the occupation and oppression of another people. “The women’s protest is the right step, but it is a protest that has no moral foundation because it is impossible to protest the murder of women while remaining silent about violence and murder that is a direct result of the occupation and blockade of the Palestinian people,” the statement said.</p> \n<p>Samah Salaime, a feminist activist and the founder of Arab Women in the Center (Na’am), opposes this specific claim, but agrees that in the end the struggle is also political. “Every feminist struggle is a political struggle,” Salaime said this week. “Our Jewish friends know this too. We will reach this conflict at a certain stage. We really don’t need preaching on the ‘moral foundation’ for the protest, not from the Palestinian side and not from the Israeli one. We don’t need to teach Palestinian feminists what the occupation does to women and what women’s rights in Gaza look like under the blockade. Military oppression and gender oppression are linked. To us, the Palestinians, it is completely clear,” she added.</p> \n<p>“Jewish feminists who want real partnership have learned the rules of the game and learned that the boundaries of Palestinian women must be respected. We will continue the struggle together,” Salaime added.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In response to a drive-by shooting attack near the West Bank settlement of Ofra on Sunday evening, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to legalize the homes in Ofra that do not have legal status.</p> \n<p>Seven people were wounded in Sunday's attack, including a 21-year-old woman in her seventh month of pregnancy, who was taken to Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem and whose condition has stabilized. Doctors at the hospital delivered her baby boy, whose condition deteriorated Sunday overnight and who is now in serious condition. The woman's husband, who was also wounded in the attack, was said to be in stable condition.</p> \n<p>The others wounded in the attack were a man in his 20s who is in moderate condition, two 16-year-old boys and two 16-year-old girls, all of whom sustained light wounds. One of them was released overnight.</p> \n<p>The Israeli military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, issued a statement Monday saying that Israeli troops, border police and other Israeli security forces were continuing to conduct searches in West Bank Palestinian villages in an effort to apprehend the attacker or attackers.</p> \n<p>A considerable number of the homes in the Ofra settlement were built even though there was no provision for their construction in the settlement's master plan. They therefore lack legal approval. Shaked said a draft has been prepared that would make the necessary changes to the plan.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the Knesset: &quot;We are all praying for the wellbeing of those injured in the terrorist attack in Ofra last night. We thank and support the doctors fighting for the baby's life. Hideous terrorists tried to murder a mother and the baby who was in her womb. It's a monstrous thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>The prime minister continued: &quot;Of course, some congratulate this act. I think it's useless to expect the Palestinian Authority to condemn it, they only contribute to incitement. Our security forces, the Shin Bet and the Israel Defense Forces, are chasing these murderers. They will catch them and we will prosecute them and settle the score with them.&quot;</p> \n<p>Referring to the Palestinian Authority's policy of providing compensation to the families of Palestinian assailants, Shaked said: &quot;Terrorists who carry out such terror attacks know that even if they are caught they will receive a lot of money, they and their families.” She added that she and Education Minister Naftali Bennett, who heads her Habayit Hayehudi party, are engaged in efforts to prevent Palestinian terrorists from receiving payment for their crimes.</p> \n<p>The justice minister was referring to a bill that would provide for the deduction of those funds from tax receipts that Israel transfers to the Palestinian Authority. The legislation would earmark it instead to West Bank Jewish settlements. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu commented on the attack in a video clip on his official Facebook page: “Everyone is praying for the wellbeing of the young woman who is fighting for her life – her baby was saved, and we are also wishing a speedy recovery to all the wounded. We will not rest until we find these murderous criminals and bring them to justice.” Sara Netanyahu, the prime minister’s wife, also wished the victims a speedy and full recovery in the video.</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin said on Monday morning: “We are praying with great concern for the recovery of the wounded in the criminal terrorist attack, and among them the young mother who brought life to the world out of the horror.” Rivlin wished the victims a quick recovery and praised “all the security forces who are chasing down the terrorists relentlessly.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hamas praised the terrorist attack late on Sunday: “Despite all the attempts to uproot the resistance to the occupation, the action on [Sunday] evening proves that the principle of resistance is still alive and beating,” said the organization.</p> \n<p>Hezbollah also praised the attack on Monday, saying &quot;The operation in Ofra is additional confirmation that the Palestinian people are determined to free their land. It is a message to all settlers that it is not safe for them.&quot;</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East peace process, Jason Greenblatt, slammed the attack as &quot;absolutely disgusting&quot; and criticized the United Nations for failing to pass a resolution condemning Hamas last Thursday.</p> \n<p>&quot;@UN this is what you defended last week when you failed to condemn Hamas. Hamas praises yet another terror attack. You had the ability to help fight against terror. Is this what the UN wants its legacy to be?&quot; Greenblatt tweeted late on Sunday.</p> \n<p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman also weighed in: &quot;Hamas calls the shooters “heroic” — yes, the same #Hamas that the @UN could not resolve to condemn last week,&quot; he wrote.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The severely disabled Abu Riash family in Jaffa has been waiting three years to receive an apartment they’re entitled to from the Halamish state-municipal housing authority in Tel Aviv. It may be that a bit of pressure is finally doing the trick.</p> \n<p>Hassan Abu Riash was born blind and so was his sister. Hassan and his wife have two daughters, one of them born last year. She is also visually impaired and requires treatment. The other daughter, Mouda, who is not yet 5, is fighting for her life due to a rare congenital defect called anencephaly, in which a large part of the brain and skull are missing.</p> \n<p>Hassan doesn’t work and lives off a monthly stipend, plus another one he receives for his daughter, amounting to a few thousand shekels. He lives with his wife and baby in a rented apartment in Jaffa, close to his parents. He pays 5,000 shekels ($1,340) rent, two thirds of which is covered by the state.</p> \n<p>Mouda has been at his parents’ house for the last year, since she requires 24-hour care, while Hassan and his wife Islam look after the baby. Mouda lacks independence and can’t see, barely holding her head up on her own, which puts her at constant risk of asphyxiation. Her body temperature keeps falling so that her caregiver constantly needs to keep her warm with blankets and other means.</p> \n<p>She goes for treatments every week, some of them private, going in and out of hospitals. Up to the age of 3, Mouda was in a special-needs kindergarten, at the instruction of her doctors, but over the last year and a half her parents have found it difficult to register her in a suitable framework.</p> \n<p>Due to the father’s visual impairment and the birth of the visually-impaired baby, Hassan’s friends now help them go to the authorities in search of help in finding a place for Mouda. “Doctors are shocked every time they see she’s still alive,” says the grandmother, with Mouda in her lap. For four years the exhausted family has been waiting for public housing through Halamish. This would be an apartment for people in wheelchairs in communities where suitable housing for them is scarce.</p> \n<p>The Abu Riash family was found to have met the criteria for such an apartment, and two months ago they finally managed, on their own, to find an apartment meeting the budgetary criteria, costing up to 1.8 million shekels ($480,000), as well as planning criteria – such apartments need to have an elevator or have no steps. All the apartments with elevators that they saw in Jaffa required manual opening of the elevator door, thereby not meeting Halamish’s criteria.</p> \n<p>The company offered Hassan several apartments, in north Tel Aviv, Lod and Ramle, which he could not take with his impairment. Halamish then told him to look for one on his own. “He can’t see ‘for sale’ signs in the street,” says his sister Shirin, who is also congenitally blind and who helps in caring for Mouda. “He’s been searching with his mother for two or three years but all the ones in Jaffa are very expensive. They didn’t find anything until this one showed up.”</p> \n<p>Last week an occupational therapist working for Halamish and the Housing Ministry came to check out the apartment. The ministry sends someone to certify that the apartment meets the specific needs of the disabled person. The therapist discovered three steps leading to the apartment’s entrance. Because of these steps, Halamish would not purchase the apartment, since it’s not considered a ground floor unit. It will purchase the flat if the municipality agrees to build a ramp.</p> \n<p>Ahmed Masharawi, a former city councilman, heard about this case and came to help. “My relative was the realtor for this apartment and he told me about the family and its struggles. You’re sometimes amazed at how cruel and indifferent the system can be towards citizens it’s supposed to serve. I can’t imagine for a minute that they’d be so abusive and evil if this was a family in north Tel Aviv.”</p> \n<p>Hassan says, “I’m a disabled person, I’m visually impaired. I have my pain and my daughter’s pain. Can I go to the municipality now about the ramp? Why do they make me go through all this? Aren’t I a human being? It’s abusive. I deserve to live. Twice a week I come to the offices of the company for public housing [Halamish]. Why are you here, they ask me each time, wait till we call you, they say. I was finally happy that I found a place, but this really knocked me back and I went into a depression, lying in bed without getting up. My wife said it would gradually pass, but they made me feel worthless in this country.”</p> \n<p>As soon as Haaretz contacted Halamish last Thursday to find out why they’re not approving the purchase, Hassan’s phone started ringing, with Halamish representatives trying to find out more details so they could find a solution. Later a response came from Halamish and the Housing Ministry: “The ministry’s director-general, Haggai Reznik, has instructed Halamish to act quickly to find a solution and approve the apartment, if it meets the price criteria and is lawfully registered, meeting the appropriate safety regulations. With regard to the ramp, the ministry will instruct the company that if the buyer wishes to purchase the apartment despite the recommendation of the occupational therapist, this should be approved.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>The Supreme Court has stiffened the sentence of an Eritrean man convicted of involvement in a gang rape, even though he personally didn’t rape the woman.</p> \n<p>The Central District Court in Lod had sentenced Kinde Tedesa to 11 years in prison, citing the fact that he refused to rape the woman himself as grounds for leniency. But the Supreme Court upped that to 14 years.</p> \n<p>Justice David Mintz, with justices Neal Hendel and Alex Stein concurring, said the longer sentence was warranted because Tedesa, 26, played a significant role in the crime, including a “dominant role” in abducting the woman. Given that he “knew his friends were raping the complainant, and that he guarded the door to enable the rape to continue, he is considered to have jointly perpetrated the rape in every respect,” Mintz wrote.</p> \n<p>The rape occurred in Rishon Letzion on the night of June 24, 2015. Tedesa and four friends saw a 31-year-old woman sitting outside a restaurant after getting drunk at a nearby pool hall and surrounded her. Tedesa sat on her lap, and his friends started touching her and urging her to go with them.</p> \n<p>The five men eventually dragged her by force to an apartment above the restaurant, where they place her on the bed and left. Two of them then came in one at a time to rape her, even though she screamed for help. Altogether, the rape lasted about an hour and 40 minutes.</p> \n<p>Tedesa was charged with kidnapping, rape and sexual assault, as were the other four. But he was tried separately, and during his trial, the question arose as to whether his acts constituted actual rape or merely abetting a rape.</p> \n<p>The district court said that since he knew his friends intended rape when they kidnapped the woman, and also knew that rape was occurring while he guarded the door, he was guilty of actual rape. But in light of the fact that he didn’t have sex with the woman, it rejected the prosecution’s request for a 24-year sentence, instead sentencing him to 11 years plus 80,000 shekels ($21,000) in compensation.</p> \n<p>The prosecution then appealed the leniency of the sentence, and the Supreme Court agreed that it was insufficient.</p> \n<p>“Watching the footage from the security cameras, which was attached to the appeal, is chilling and rouses extremely difficult emotions,” Mintz wrote. “The footage shows the complainant being led with failing strength to the room where the group carried out its plot. Her drunkenness and her many attempts to escape exhausted her, but she nevertheless continued resisting with the last of her strength.”</p> \n<p>He also noted that Tedesa had failed to accept responsibility for his actions.</p> \n<p>The cases of the other four men are still pending.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Some 500 children who are on the autism spectrum, but are sufficiently high-functioning as to be integrated into regular kindergartens, are not receiving health-promoting treatments they are entitled to by law.</p> \n<p>According to experts in the field, such after-hours treatment has vital significance for acquiring social and cognitive skills, but only 200 out of 700 who are in the system are currently receiving such treatment, at only eight centers around the country.</p> \n<p>Last week, a mother of a child on the spectrum, along with Alut, the non-profit Israeli Society for Children and Adults with Autism, filed a petition with the High Court of Justice with regard to this matter. They asked the court to instruct the Ministry of Health to explain why it does not approve and finance the opening of additional treatment centers for children aged three to seven who are integrated into regular kindergartens. The parents of these children argue that the ministry channels these children away from regular kindergartens.</p> \n<p>The integrated children are relatively high-functioning on the autistic spectrum, which enables them to attend regular schools, with some assistance. They are entitled to 14.5 hours of extra after-hours help a week, according to the national health law.</p> \n<p>According to Alut, this costs 90,000 shekels ($24,000) a year per child, amounting to an additional 45 million shekels for the 500 children currently excluded from these programs. Another 4,000 children on the spectrum go to 600 “communications kindergartens” in the special needs educational stream, where they receive the extra enrichment.</p> \n<p>The petition says that the Health Ministry is not opening new treatment centers for budgetary reasons, thus discriminating against children who are integrated in regular institutions. “The ministry does not approve new programs in order to avoid the expenses incurred,” says the petition.</p> \n<p>The extra programs enable these children to be functionally independent, as well as strengthening skills that will let them obtain further education and integrate into society. The programs include children and their parents, with many professionals involved, such as behavior analysts, communications clinicians, psychologists, occupational therapists and creative and expression therapists. “Experts say that the treatment and acquisition of social and cognitive skills have great impact on the development of children on the spectrum, especially in their early years,” says the petition.</p> \n<p>According to attorney Moti Arad, from the Ron, Gazit, Rotenberg Law Office, who is representing Alut pro bono, “the health ministry is evading the transfer of vital funds for delivering essential treatment for autistic children who are integrated into regular kindergartens, thereby pushing them into the special needs educational stream which suits them less well and costs the state more. We hope the High Court instructs the ministry on how to proceed, and then the funds will be found. It’s too bad children and their parents have to suffer in the meantime.”</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry says that it has not yet seen the petition and that when it does it will respond to the petition in court.</p>",

They have travelled so frequently that they can’t recall how many overseas vacations they have taken in the last few years.</p> \n<p>“If I find a ticket for Barcelona for $200, why shouldn’t I buy it?” she says.</p> \n<p>The couple are typical of the new breed of travelling Israelis, who have taken advantage of the revolution in airfares since 2013 wrought by the Open Skies aviation agreement with the European Union. Open Skies brought down airfares by allowing new carriers and new destinations to service Israel.</p> \n<p>This year alone, some 8.5 million outbound flights will be recorded out of Ben-Gurion International Airport, a 12% increase over 2017. All told, the airport will handle 23 million passengers this year and expects to handle 25 million in 2019.</p> \n<p>A recent report by the Israel Airports Authority forecasts a 14% increase in the number of flights into and out of Israel this winter season to an average 1,198 a week. The number has jumped 57% since the 2014-15 season.</p> \n<p>Foreign carriers are enjoying the biggest growth, with low-cost carriers leading the way. EasyJet, for instance, will be flying 70 weekly flights, up from 53 this year. Israeli airlines, led by El Al, are increasing their flights by just 6% year on year. As a result, their share of total flights serving Ben-Gurion is due to drop to 27% this winter, down from 29% a year earlier and 33% two years ago.</p> \n<p>The big question is when the new Ramon Airport servicing domestic and international flights to the southern resort town of Eilat will open. The IAA declines to commit itself to a date, although it is widely expected to be sometime during this winter season.</p> \n<p>Right now, 5% of all international flights to and from Israel go through the existing Uvda Airport near Eilat.</p>",

The new, 5 million shekel ($1.3 million) facility will begin operations next April.</p> \n<p>Fattal is entering a crowded market.

We Work, which pioneered the concept, recently expanded its offerings with a four-floor site at the ToHA site in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>A key part of the company’s strategy is to locate its shared-office facilities near its hotels so that office tenants can make use of hotel services, including meals, spa and bar services and conference facilities, said Ron Yariv, who is heading up the new Fattal operations.</p> \n<p>“That way companies can enjoy many additional services beyond the office services and community networks offered in other work spaces,” Yariv said. “At the same time, hotel guests can make use of our office services and network with other business people renting space in our facility.”</p> \n<p>Fattal’s first shared workspace will be located next to one of its NYX boutique hotels, which has been operating from the Amot complex since 2014.

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;A historic renovation of the Church of the Nativity is lifting spirits in the biblical town of Bethlehem ahead of Christmas, offering visitors a look at ancient mosaics and columns that have been restored to their original glory for the first time in 600 years.</p> \n<p>City officials hope the renovation at the traditional birthplace of Jesus will boost tourism and a weak economy in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and perhaps slow a decades-long drain of the Christian population from the lands where the faith was born.</p> \n<p>“Christians are leaving the Holy Land due to the lack of peace and economic hardships and we are struggling to keep them in their homeland,” said Bethlehem Mayor Anton Salman. “This is one of the ways.”</p> \n<p>The renovation started in 2013, a year after UNESCO declared the church a world heritage site, and is expected to be completed by the end of next year. The Palestinian Authority formed a committee of local Christian leaders to oversee the renovation and contracted an Italian company to carry out the project.</p> \n<p>Ziad al-Bandak, the committee head, said it has collected $14 million out of $17 million needed. Roughly half of the funding has come from the Palestinian Authority and local Muslim and Christian businesses, and the rest from foreign donors.</p> \n<p>“It has become such a beautiful church,” he said. “Every Christian in the world would love to see it now.”</p> \n<p>One of Christianity’s most sacred shrines, the church was built in the 4th century by Saint Helena over a cave where the Virgin Mary is said to have given birth. What pilgrims mostly see today is the basilica built by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I, who ruled from A.D. 527 to 565.</p> \n<p>Neglected for decades before the renovation, the roof of the church was leaking, windows were broken, mosaics were covered in grime and walls and columns were damaged.</p> \n<p>After five years of work, it has been transformed.</p> \n<p>Emad Nassar, a Palestinian engineer overseeing the renovations, said the project started with the ceiling. Roughly 10 percent of the beams were replaced with wood imported from old destroyed churches in Italy, windows were fixed, and outside stones and walls were renovated.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the biggest challenge has been repairing the badly damaged 2,000 square meter (21,500 square foot) wall mosaic. So far, 120 square meters (1,292 square feet) have been restored, depicting images of Christ and Christian saints. Workers are also restoring a floor mosaic.</p> \n<p>The restoration process is meticulous and painstaking. As Nassar spoke, three Italian workers were cleaning a mosaic with tiny brushes and covering them with protective material.</p> \n<p>“In the coming year, we are going to continue renovating the columns, the floor mosaic, the tiles and the front yard floor,” Nassar said.</p> \n<p>The delicate relations between the Holy Land’s major Christian denominations have factored into the poor condition of the church. The Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches have traditionally viewed each other with deep suspicion.</p> \n<p>Under a 19th-century agreement called the Status Quo, each denomination has its own areas and responsibilities. But over the years, turf battles have erupted into arguments and even fistfights among clergymen.</p> \n<p>Father Samour, a 70-year-old Greek Orthodox clergyman who has served at the church for nearly half a century, said the Palestinian Authority managed to get the rival churches on board.</p> \n<p>The construction did not touch the altar crypt with the 14-point silver star marking the spot where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus was born. Although it also needs renovation, the churches have not yet reached an agreement on the crypt.</p> \n<p>Bethlehem is heavily dependent on Christmas tourism, with hotels, restaurants and gift stores doing much of their business during the short holiday season. The renovated church has become a popular destination.</p> \n<p>“The mosaic on the walls is very beautiful, and the renovation is very impressive,” said Sandris Gradins, a 31-year-old tourist from Latvia.</p> \n<p>After dipping in 2015 and 2016, tourism has seen a comeback in the past two years, officials say. The mayor said he expects 1.2 million visitors this year.</p> \n<p>Tourism Minister Rula Maayah said she is working with Christian officials to expand visiting hours to accommodate the long lines.</p> \n<p>An ambitious program has been set up for Christmas this year, she said. The municipality recently hosted representatives of 14 twin cities from around the world for a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Foreign musicians performed Christmas songs during the event.</p> \n<p>Fifteen European countries participated in a Christmas market in the front yard of the church. The municipality also has been building a Christmas village for children.</p> \n<p>But whether the city’s efforts can stop the long-term outflow of Bethlehem’s Christians remains to be seen. As elsewhere in the Arab world, the local Christian community has struggled for decades, escaping conflict and economic troubles in search of better opportunities abroad.</p> \n<p>In the Holy Land, Israel’s half-century-old occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and more than a decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas in Gaza have significantly worsened the situation.</p> \n<p>A 2017 census in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem counted just under 47,000 Palestinian Christians, or about 1 percent of a Palestinian population of close to 4.8 million. Twenty years earlier, Christians still made up more than 1.7 percent of the Palestinian population, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> \n<p>Roughly half of Palestinian Christians live in the Bethlehem area, where their share of the population has also declined significantly.</p> \n<p>Wadie Abunassar, a senior adviser to church leaders in the Holy Land, said the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank has treated Christians well, but that lack of progress toward a resolution with Israel and Palestinian statehood have driven emigration.</p> \n<p>Despite lack of hope, he urged Christians to stay.</p> \n<p>“This is our homeland. We are called to be witnesses for Jesus in his homeland,” he said. “This is a great privilege, which most Christians in the world don’t have.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>&nbsp;Top House Democrats have raised the prospect of impeachment or the real possibility of prison time for President Donald Trump if it’s proved that he directed illegal hush-money payments to women, adding to the legal pressure on the president over the Russia investigation and other scandals.</p> \n<p>“There’s a very real prospect that on the day Donald Trump leaves office, the Justice Department may indict him, that he may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the incoming chairman of the House intelligence committee. “The bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether to pardon Donald Trump.”</p> \n<p>Rep. Jerry Nadler, the incoming chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described the details in prosecutors’ filings Friday in the case of Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, as evidence that Trump was “at the center of a massive fraud.”</p> \n<p>“They would be impeachable offenses,” Nadler said.</p> \n<p>In the filings, prosecutors in New York for the first time link Trump to a federal crime of illegal payments to buy the silence of two women during the 2016 campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office also laid out previously undisclosed contacts between Trump associates and Russian intermediaries and suggested the Kremlin aimed early on to influence Trump and his Republican campaign by playing to both his political and personal business interests.</p> \n<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing and has compared the investigations to a “witch hunt.”</p> \n<p>Nadler, D-N.Y., said it was too early to say whether Congress would pursue impeachment proceedings based on the illegal payments alone because lawmakers would need to weigh the gravity of the offense to justify “overturning” the 2016 election. Nadler and other lawmakers said Sunday they would await additional details from Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference and possible coordination with the Trump campaign to determine the extent of Trump’s misconduct.</p> \n<p>Regarding the illegal payments, “whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question, but certainly they’d be impeachable offenses because even though they were committed before the president became president, they were committed in the service of fraudulently obtaining the office,” Nadler said.</p> \n<p>Mueller has not said when he will complete a report of any findings, and it isn’t clear that any such report would be made available to Congress. That would be up to the attorney general. Trump on Friday said he would nominate former Attorney General William Barr to the post to succeed Jeff Sessions.</p> \n<p>Nadler indicated that Democrats, who will control the House in January, will step up their own investigations. He said Congress, the Justice Department and the special counsel need to dig deeper into the allegations, which include questions about whether Trump lied about his business arrangements with Russians and about possible obstruction of justice.</p> \n<p>“The new Congress will not try to shield the president,” he said. “We will try to get to the bottom of this, in order to serve the American people and to stop this massive conspiracy — this massive fraud on the American people.”</p> \n<p>Schiff, D-Calif., also stressed a need to wait “until we see the full picture.” He has previously indicated his panel would seek to look into the Trump family’s business ties with Russia.</p> \n<p>“I think we also need to see this as a part of a broader pattern of potential misconduct by the president, and it’s that broad pattern, I think, that will lead us to a conclusion about whether it rises to the level to warrant removal from office,” Schiff said.</p> \n<p>In the legal filings, the Justice Department stopped short of accusing Trump of directly committing a crime. But it said Trump told Cohen to make illegal payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, both of whom claimed to have had affairs with Trump more than a decade ago.</p> \n<p>In separate filings, Mueller’s team detail how Cohen spoke to a Russian who “claimed to be a ‘trusted person’ in the Russian Federation who could offer the campaign ‘political synergy’ and ‘synergy on a government level.’” Cohen said he never followed up on that meeting. Mueller’s team also said former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to them about his contacts with a Russian associate and Trump administration officials, including in 2018.</p> \n<p>Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called the latest filings “relevant” in judging Trump’s fitness for office but said lawmakers need more information to render judgment. He also warned the White House about considering a pardon for Manafort, saying such a step could trigger congressional debate about limiting a president’s pardon powers.</p> \n<p>Such a move would be “a terrible mistake,” Rubio said. “Pardons should be used judiciously. They’re used for cases with extraordinary circumstances.”</p> \n<p>Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, cautioned against a rush to impeachment, which he said citizens could interpret as “political revenge and a coup against the president.”</p> \n<p>“The best way to solve a problem like this, to me, is elections,” King said. “I’m a conservative when it comes to impeachment. I think it’s a last resort and only when the evidence is clear of a really substantial legal violation. We may get there, but we’re not there now.”</p> \n<p>Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut urged Mueller to “show his cards soon” so that Congress can make a determination early next year on whether to act on impeachment.</p> \n<p>“Let’s be clear: We have reached a new level in the investigation,” Murphy said. “It’s important for Congress to get all of the underlying facts and data and evidence that the special counsel has.”</p> \n<p>Nadler spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, Rubio was on CNN and ABC’s “This Week,” and Schiff appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Murphy spoke on ABC, and King was on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”</p>",

Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, who is not Jewish, made the accusations, which were off the topic, during an appearance Thursday on the Fox Business Network with Stuart Varney.</p> \n<p>Varney did not challenge the accusations and steered the conversation back to the topic they were supposed to be discussing.</p> \n<p>In the following broadcast hour, Varney issued an on-air apology, saying: “In the last hour one of our guests, Congressman Louie Gohmert, for some reason went out of his way to bring up George Soros and made up unsubstantiated and false allegations against him. I want to make clear those views are not shared by me, this program or anyone at Fox Business.”</p> \n<p>Gohmert&nbsp;said&nbsp;during the interview: “George Soros is supposed to be Jewish, but you wouldn’t know it from the damage he’s inflicted on Israel and the fact that he turned on fellow Jews and helped take the property that they owned.”</p> \n<p>Soros, a major supporter of liberal causes, has become a popular villain on the far right. Gohmert’s statements echo accusations from Soros’ critics of his funding for left-wing and human rights groups in Israel, and unfounded allegations that he collaborated with Nazis as a Jewish teen in Hungary during the Holocaust. Soros, who was 13 in 1944, survived the Holocaust in the care of a Hungarian official whose job included taking inventory of confiscated Jewish-owned property.</p> \n<p>In response to the interview, the National Council of Young Israel&nbsp;tweeted: “What&nbsp;@replouiegohmert&nbsp;said was based upon this interview w/ 60 Minutes. Soros in his own words clearly implied he helped confiscate Jewish property during holocaust while posing as a non Jew &amp; saying he felt no guilt doing so.” The tweet included a&nbsp;link to the interview.</p> \n<p>In the interview, Soros noted that he was just a child said he had no actual role in taking the property and therefore felt no guilt.</p> \n<p>Many replies to the tweet suggested that the organization should be ashamed for smearing a child Holocaust survivor.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Moshe Leon is to be congratulated on being elected the new mayor of Jerusalem, Israel’s capital. It was a hard-fought campaign against Ofer Berkovitch, head of the Hitorerut party,which garnered almost half the votes. It could have gone either way, and was an expression of the feelings of the residents of Jerusalem. Now it’s time to run the city as a united one.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, very few of Jerusalem’s Arab residents participated in the election – not enough to elect an Arab member to the city council. The absence of such a council member will be sorely felt. Hopefully, this will change in the next election.</p> \n<p>The task facing the new mayor and the new city council is to make Jerusalem a truly united city. As we all know only too well Jerusalem is not a really a united city at present. Jerusalem’s municipal boundaries were established by a decision of the government of Israel after the Six-Day War.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; How to turn Jerusalem into an economic powerhouse</p> \n<p>Fifty one years later, it does not matter what were the reasons behind that decision. The municipal boundaries have not been changed since then, and should not be changed. They have become the symbol of a united Jerusalem, of a realty that ties the Jewish and Arab population of the city together. Jerusalem should be united and not divided.</p> \n<p>It is in Jerusalem that we can measure whether or not there has been progress in the integration of the city’s Arab residents and Jewish residents. This reflects and has a dramatic impact on the problems of integration of Israel’s Arab citizens in the larger society and economy.</p> \n<p>The primary difference is the fact that the large majority of Jerusalem’s Arabs are not Israeli citizens, although most have the option of receiving Israeli citizenship. The difficulties that the Ministry of Interior places before Arabs applying for Israeli citizenship is evidence that there are forces in Israel reluctant to promote this move. Not everyone supports it. There is progress, but it is very slow.</p> \n<p>It is in the economic sphere that integration is most apparent. Much of Jerusalem’s economy is in the hands of Arabs residing in East Jerusalem – bus and taxi transportation, hotels and restaurants, and commercial establishments. Nowadays it is difficult to visualize Jerusalem functioning without its Arab residents.</p> \n<p>It is in the physical appearance and living conditions of the East Jerusalem neighborhoods that the differences are, to say the least, shocking and tend to encourage hostility and even violence among its Arab residents and violence between Arab and Jewish residents, rather than not social integration. This is a major challenge now facing the mayor, the new municipal council, and the government.</p> \n<p>It should come as no surprise that many of the same problems that Jerusalem’s Arab residents face in integrating into Israel’s society and economy, are also experienced by Arab citizens of Israel who live Jerusalem. Uniting Jerusalem can be viewed as part of the relationship between Jews and Arabs throughout Israel.</p> \n<p>It is here that Jerusalem has a major role to play in the development of the country as a whole. Not only as Israel’s capital, but as an example of how to bring Israel’s Jewish and Arab citizens to work amicably together for the benefit of their country and for their mutual benefit.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem needs to be united, but Jerusalem also has the power to unite. Success in Jerusalem will lead to success throughout the country.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister and interior minister, is the latest in a parade of right-wing populist leaders who have visited Israel and have been warmly welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p> \n<p>Salvini, who is set to visit Israel on Tuesday and Wednesday, is known for the anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic policies he has promoted since he was catapulted to power by elections last spring. He has strong ties with other European and international populist politicians, but has also marketed his own brand of homegrown right-wing nationalism. Here are few must-know facts about him and his meteoric rise to political power:</p> \n<p>Separatist roots</p> \n<p>Salvini, 45, was born in Milan into a well-to-do family. After flirting with communism in his youth, he joined the Northern League party, a movement that advocated the separation of Italy's prosperous north from the country's poorer and underdeveloped south.</p> \n<p>Since rising to lead the League in 2013, he has transformed it from a party that capitalized on the hostility of northern Italians toward their southern neighbors into a party that capitalizes on nationwide hostility toward immigrants and EU policies, seen by supporters as sources of crime and Italy's economic ills, respectively.</p> \n<p>Fascist connection?</p> \n<p>Pledging to put &quot;Italians first&quot; and &quot;cleanse&quot; Italy of illegal migrants, &quot;by force if necessary,&quot; Salvini won 17 percent of the vote in March elections,&nbsp; allowing the League to enter into an uneasy &quot;grand coalition&quot; of populists with the 5 Star Movement, the grassroots anti-establishment party founded by comedian Beppe Grillo.</p> \n<p>Salvini is now Italy's most popular politician, and polls suggest the League would take more than 30 percent of the vote if elections were held today. While the League itself doesn't have fascist roots, many small neo-fascist parties have expressed support for Salvini and many of his rallies are well-attended by militants of these movements, sporting fascist symbols and portraits of Benito Mussolini. A savvy communicator, Salvini has often nodded to this sector of supporters by citing Il Duce's sayings and claiming that fascism had many positive achievements.</p> \n<p>Divisive policies</p> \n<p>Since becoming interior minister, Salvini has been criticized at home and abroad for his hardline policies on migrants. He has barred ships that rescued migrants at sea from docking at Italian ports.</p> \n<p>A recent law that he pushed through Parliament, nicknamed the &quot;Salvini decree&quot;, introduced tough new measures such as abolishing humanitarian protection for migrants not eligible for refugee status and resulted in dozens of vulnerable people being kicked out of state-run centers for migrants.</p> \n<p>Salvini also made headlines by proposing to make a census of Roma people (also known as Gypsies) and expelling those without Italian citizenship. The plan was condemned by rights groups and by Italy's Jewish community, which saw eerie parallels with the anti-Semitic legislation enacted by Mussolini's regime in 1938.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Viva Trump, Viva Putin&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini once summed up his international political links by tweeting: “Viva Trump, viva Putin, viva Le Pen,” referring to Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, a key ally for the League in the European Parliament.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The League has forged official ties with Vladimir Putin's United Russia party and Salvini has praised the Russian president's strongman policies and criticized EU sanctions on Moscow. He is equally admiring of U.S. President Donald Trump, and the &quot;legality and security&quot; the he feels his policies will bring to Americans.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Rivlin won't meet with Italy's far-right leader Matteo Salvini during his upcoming Israel visit&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini met with Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon earlier this year and has been among the first to join Bannon's &quot;The Movement,&quot; which aims to group together Europe's populist parties ahead of EU parliament elections next year.</p> \n<p>Social media star</p> \n<p>The rotund and smiling Salvini owes much of his success to his informal, approachable style and massive social media presence. He has been named as the European politician with the largest following on social media and regularly tweets about his policies, publishes selfies from rallies and meetings, alongside pictures of tiramisu, spaghetti and other favorite dishes.</p> \n<p>He openly rows with his critics online: Last week he sparred with former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, who had panned his policies on Twitter,&nbsp; and he was recently criticized for publishing the photos of three underage protesters and exposing them to online abuse by his fans.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini's social media stardom has also been a source of gaffes and embarrassing moments. Last month, his girlfriend, TV personality Elisa Isoardi, broke up with him by publishing an intimate selfie of the couple on Instagram.</p> \n<p>Last week, Salvini was also excoriated by prosecutors for tweeting about a police raid against an organized crime group before it happened, possibly helping some of the suspects escape arrest.</p> \n<p>'Brother of Israel'</p> \n<p>While some core supporters of the League have been friendly to the Palestinian cause, mainly because of the party's past independentism, Salvini has displayed a strong pro-Israel vein in recent years.</p> \n<p>He has called himself a “friend and brother of Israel” and visited the country in 2016, meeting with Knesset members and condemning Hamas for “holding hostage” millions of Israelis and Palestinians.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, Salvini has not shied away from conspiracy theories tinged with anti-Semitism, such as the familiar accusation that Jewish-American billionaire George Soros supports illegal immigration into Europe.</p>",

        "text":["<p>NEW YORK – After Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she had Jewish ancestry, many U.S. Jews took to social media Monday to welcome her &quot;to the tribe.&quot;</p> \n<p>Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old incoming Democratic representative from New York, told the crowd at a Hanukkah candle-lighting event on Sunday that she has Jewish heritage.</p> \n<p>The news of Ocasio-Cortez' speech, first revealed by Haaretz, went viral.</p> \n<p>“Well, welcome to the tribe (I guess) @Ocasio2018!!!” Jewish-American activist Abby Stein wrote. “We have a long history of #resistance, fighting #oppression&nbsp;– from the start we were immigrants, and instructed to embrace [those] in need&nbsp;– the amazing work you have been doing fits perfectly in our long line of resilience!&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Ocasio-Cortez reveals Jewish heritage at Hanukkah event: 'my family was Sephardic'</p> \n<p>Preempting potential criticism, Ocasio-Cortez, who has Puerto Rican ancestry, wrote on Twitter: “Before everyone jumps one me – yes, culture isn’t DNA.&quot; She added: “Just because one concrete identity may not be how we think of ourselves today, nor how we were raised, it doesn’t mean we cannot or should not honor the ancestors + stories that got us here. I was raised Catholic, &amp; that identity is an amalgam too&nbsp;– especially in Latin America.”</p> \n<p>She added: “If anything, the stories of our ancestry give us windows of opportunity to lean into others, to seek them out, and see ourselves, our histories, and our futures, tightly knit with other communities in a way we perhaps never before thought possible.”</p> \n<p>After lighting Hanukkah candles Sunday in an event hosted by a left-wing Jewish group in her home borough of Queens, Ocasio-Cortez surprised the crowd by saying members of her family were descendants of Jews who were forced to convert and flee Spain during the Inquisition in the late 15th century.</p> \n<p>&quot;[My family has] been doing a lot of family trees in the last couple of years. And one of the things a lot of people don’t know about Puerto Rico, and something we discovered ourselves, is that a long time ago, many generations ago, my family consisted of&nbsp;Sephardic Jews,&quot; Ocasio-Cortez said.</p> \n<p>She later told Haaretz this was the first time she has spoken publicly about her family's Jewish history.</p> \n<p>An author of book about the Spanish Inquisition, Adam Gidwitz, tweeted: “So glad to have Ocasio as a member of the Tribe! There are many ways to be Jewish, including being a Puerto Rican Catholic whose Jewish family fled the Spanish Inquisition. While our families' paths seemed to have diverged, in fact we've been walking side by side all along”.</p> \n<p>Ocasio-Cortez drew criticism from conservatives, with some demanding to see her DNA tests, and comparing her claims to those of Elizabeth Warren, who claimed Native American heritage.&nbsp;Her speech also generated some anti-Semitic responses, one of them from white nationalist leader Richard Spencer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Others saw the speech as an opportunity to start a conversation about the history of Sephardic Jews in Latin America, and the experiences of Jews of color, who sometimes face challenges when claiming their Jewish identity.</p> \n<p>Marlabetz Figueroa, a member of The Puerto Rican Center of Arizona, wrote to those criticizing her: “You need a Puerto Rican history lesson. Just because her last name is not Gold, Neubergh, etc. that doesn’t mean she is not Sephardic.. If you are of Spanish decent there is a likely hood that you will have Sephardic heritage. If you don’t know about the people who immigrated to PR, now is the time to get your history books.&quot;</p> \n<p>Around 300,000 Jews lived in Spain before Catholic monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand ordered Jews and Muslims to convert to the Catholic faith or leave the country. There are roughly 3.5 million direct descendants of those expelled from Spain in 1492, living in countries like Israel, France, the United States, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina and Chile.</p> \n<p>At the event, which was organized by Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and held at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, the young congresswoman-elect reflected on this history: &quot;The story goes that during the Spanish Inquisition, Jews were forced, on the exterior, to convert to Catholicism, but on the interior they continued to be who they were, continued to practice their faith.&quot;</p> \n<p>She continued: &quot;A strong group of people, who wanted to continue living life the way they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat and leave Spain. Some of these people ended up in Puerto Rico.&quot;</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico currently has a small Jewish community of some 1,500 members.</p> \n<p>The Democratic socialist from New York has made headlines several times over the past year with remarks on Jews and Israel. Last month, she drew criticism&nbsp;for comparing&nbsp;the Central American migrant caravans at the U.S.-Mexico border to Jews fleeing Nazi Europe.</p> \n<p>After suprisingly&nbsp;defeating a longtime incumbent in a Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress. She is among a number of young&nbsp;progressive women recently elected to the U.S Congress&nbsp;and considered part of a new generation in the Democratic Party. She will represent New York's 14th Congressional District, which covers Queens and parts of the Bronx.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When it was reported last week that Denmark’s government had decided to deport 100 refugees and other “undesirable” migrants to the remote island of Lindholm, which used to serve as a refuge for contagious animals, it seemed an excellent opportunity for Israel to file a petition against Denmark at the International Court of Justice in The Hague for stealing its patent.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Lindholm is the equivalent of Israel’s Holot detention facility. Migrants are not welcome in Denmark, which is currently ruled by a moderate, center-right government.</p> \n<p>The migrants have become a major political issue in a country that once had a reputation for being a compassionate place that had saved its Jews. But, as in other European countries, anyone in Denmark wishing to win elections must now make refugees suffer. This is the aim of the Danish decision, as explained by its Minister for Immigration Inger Stojberg: “They must understand that they’re not wanted here.”</p> \n<p>This would seem like yet another nasty action originating in the right wing of a European country anxious about the integrity of its homeland, society and culture, one more incriminating item in the book of abuses committed by the “West” on the miserable people of the East and South, who only wish to better their lives, or to avoid death.</p> \n<p>However, a few days prior to that decision, a soul-searching account by the Algerian intellectual, author and journalist Kamel Daoud was published in an article entitled “It’s not enough to blame the West; we’re also responsible for this tragedy.”</p> \n<p>“For me, the West is neither just nor unjust,” writes Daoud. “I don’t enjoy waiting for justice, as if this were something depending on someone’s generosity towards me, as if it were a gift. I’m responsible for my world, and this responsibility cannot hide behind post-colonial discourse. I’m fed up with hearing that we’re victims and that the West is our hangman, the only one responsible for our present tragedy.”</p> \n<p>Daoud does not absolve the West from responsibility for its treatment of refugees, but he pins most of the blame on the circumstances that led these people to flee their countries. He pulls no punches in harshly criticizing those Arab intellectuals who not only rush to place all the responsibility on the West, but who regard anyone disagreeing with them as a traitor.</p> \n<p>“Every day, in my country, I read articles in the conservative Islamist press in which migrants arriving from the sub-Sahara are called Africans, as though we in the Maghreb were Japanese. These articles say that these migrants are guilty of crimes and violence, of spreading disease, and that they are all in all a threat. These are the same insults hurled in Europe at migrants coming from the Maghreb.”</p> \n<p>Daoud maintains that anyone wishing to criticize the West should come with clean hands, adding, “and mine aren’t.” He relates how he considered emigrating to a European country with better medical services when his 1-year-old son contracted a serious illness.</p> \n<p>“I was ready to leave in order to save my son, to go into exile, even though I’d always opposed the notion of leaving.” Despite understanding the motives of these migrants, Daoud admits that when he sees hundreds of African migrants close to his house in Oran, he finds it difficult to reconcile his fear [of them] and his indifference [towards them] with his humanistic feelings and generosity.</p> \n<p>“I’m anxious about the comfortable life I’ve invested so many years into building, I worry about my safety. Suddenly, I’m at the same time a Western person and a person who’s arrived from the sub-Sahara. … I understand those who don’t want to welcome the Other, as well as those who leave their countries.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;New UN Refugee Representative: If Israel doesn't act now, it will fail this generation&nbsp;■&nbsp;&nbsp;Noam Chomsky: Migrants are fleeing horrors created by the U.S. in Latin America&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The migrants who have arrived en masse in Western countries have created a new political reality, which is expressed in the election results in some of these countries. The rise of the right, the reawakening of classical racism, the violence against migrants and the defensive walls put up by Europe around itself is only part of this cultural revolution.</p> \n<p>Arab states and intellectuals do not usually deal with the implications of the rise in refugee and migrant numbers for their own countries. These societies believe they are only waystations, and as such they have no responsibility for caring for these refugees.</p> \n<p>Daoud poses a polished mirror in front of Arab society’s face when presenting the following pointed paradox: “The West is an imaginary space encompassing a multiplicity of perceptions held by the South. We dream of going there, but also of destroying it, living there and bringing about its demise, converting its religion but also enjoying the opportunities of freedom it provides. … Arab states exploit the West, especially in order to dodge responsibility for their own world.”</p> \n<p>Daoud has no practical and immediate solution for these dilemmas or for the emotional ambivalence created by the phenomenon of migration. He proposes that the West and the Arabs embrace culture as a means of bridging gaps. He suggests learning about cultural differences not just through reading, but by shaping one’s own culture. “If one can go to war in the name of a holy book, one can also make peace in the name of that book.”</p> \n<p>It’s doubtful that the Danish minister of immigration has read Daoud’s article, despite his willingness to empathize with her distress. She doesn’t need his understanding or forgiveness. Her dilemmas are not his dilemmas. She’s committed to protecting her culture, even if it is being warped because of those who wish to save themselves and their children.</p>",

        "text":["<p>BERLIN – One morning in the first half of 2017, a black van stopped on a street in the Turkish capital Ankara. Two men in civilian clothes stepped out and pounced on a man walking by. They dragged him into the van and sped off. The whole incident took no more than a few minutes, according to media reports and human rights groups.</p> \n<p>The man who was kidnapped tried to fight off his assailants, but they beat him, covered his head with a black hood and cuffed his feet, he said. A year after the incident, he still has a big scar on his leg, a souvenir of the wound he sustained during the kidnapping.</p> \n<p>“I quickly realized that there was no point in trying to defend myself, and that I had to calm down and act in a calculated way,” the man, who is using the pseudonym Tolga, told Haaretz and other journalists in a joint investigation by nine international media coordinated by the nonprofit newsroom CORRECTIV.</p> \n<p>As the kidnappers’ vehicle approached the facility where Tolga would remain for months, he heard a large iron gate open. He was taken to a closed facility, where he was put in a cell. The door closed and he could hear instructions over a loudspeaker: Every time there was a knock at the door, he would have to turn to the wall and look at the floor so he would not see his captors.</p> \n<p>“I saw all my loved ones before my eyes – I thought they were going to kill me,” he said.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more:&nbsp;There are no checks and balances in Turkey, there's only Erdogan, Israeli expert explains&nbsp;■&nbsp;Erdogan's long arm: The Turkish dissidents kidnapped from Europe</p> \n<p>In the weeks following his abduction, his relatives, along with lawyers and human rights activists, tried to locate Tolga but could find out nothing. His family launched a campaign on social media, and also appealed to the foreign media and the international community – but not a shred of information could be found.</p> \n<p>Since the coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016, several disappearances of civilians have been reported; most occurred in Ankara in broad daylight. They all follow a similar pattern: The victims were pulled into a black commercial vehicle, a Volkswagen van, by people who didn’t try to conceal themselves. Subsequent attempts to locate the abducted person failed, and many families reported that the authorities ignored their requests for help.</p> \n<p>Testimonies, videos and documents that reached Haaretz and the other journalists raise suspicions that the Turkish government is behind the forced disappearance of Turkish citizens, most of them linked to the movement of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in exile in Pennsylvania and who the government accuses of orchestrating the attempted coup.</p> \n<p>Tolga and another man, Ali (also a pseudonym), related separately and without knowing each other the chain of events. They both said they were held for a long time in facilities they could not identify, and that for their entire captivity they had no access to the outside world. They underwent interrogation and torture designed to make them testify against their friends.</p> \n<p>By press time, the Turkish government had not responded to queries about forced disappearances. But Mustafa Yeneroglu, the chairman of the Turkish parliament’s human rights committee, told BBC Turkey in June 2017 that the committee had opened an investigation into the cases that had been referred to it.</p> \n<p>Turkish officials, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan among them, have rejected accusations of torture during arrests in Turkey. Officials have called such accusations unfounded and said the government’s policy is “zero tolerance for torture.”</p> \n<p>The shock of the night of July 15, 2016, can still be felt in Turkey. That night, a group of army officers tried to take over key installations in Ankara, Istanbul and other cities, with the declared objective of taking power in defense of a democratic and secular Turkey. But forces loyal to the government, helped by many civilians, quelled the coup within 12 hours. In one of the night’s most dramatic moments, Erdogan recorded a cellphone message that was broadcast on TV in which he blamed Gulen for staging the putsch.</p> \n<p>After the failed coup, Erdogan launched a campaign against alleged opponents of the regime. At least 150,000 people were fired and thousands of institutions linked to Gulen were closed. Around 160,000 people were arrested, including hundreds of journalists, police commanders, judges and prosecutors, the United Nations said. These people are usually taken to Turkish prisons and other official detention facilities, unlike the cases of Tolga and Ali, who apparently aren’t the only ones to suffer an ordeal.</p> \n<p>Haaretz and the other journalists recently met with Tolga in a hotel room in a Western European country, where he has received asylum based on human rights violations that threatened his life. For several hours Tolga described his experiences during and after his arrest. “The cell I was in was 2 meters by one and a half meters,” he said. “The floor was dark and covered in soft cloth, as were the walls, apparently so that inmates couldn’t commit suicide by bashing their heads against them.”</p> \n<p>At the beginning, Tolga said, he was interrogated frequently; guards beat him, delivered electric shocks, threatened him with rape and warned him that they would do the same to his family if he did not cooperate. Tolga said the room looked like it had been designed for torture.</p> \n<p>“High on the wall were rings for attaching hands to the wall, with lower ones for the feet. There were other torture instruments and clubs,” he said. Tolga’s statements could not be independently verified, but the day after his release he documented his story on videotape, which the researchers watched.</p> \n<p>Seeking turncoats against Gulen</p> \n<p>Tolga had worked in an institution that is identified with Gulen and was closed down after the coup attempt. He was a member of Gulen’s movement for years, and his interrogators wanted him to supply information related to that. “They showed me photos of people from work; they pointed to them and asked questions,” he said.</p> \n<p>Tolga says his captors wanted to recruit him to take part in trials against Gulen’s movement as an anonymous witness, testifying from behind a curtain to conceal his identity. Eren Keskin, a lawyer and human rights activist who was involved in cases accused of taking part in the failed coup, confirmed for researchers that this was common practice.</p> \n<p>“They use anonymous witnesses because there is no other evidence,” she said. “This is an undemocratic method that doesn’t exist in law-abiding states.”</p> \n<p>Toward the end of his detention, Tolga said, he pretended to collaborate with his captors and the torture abated. “They told me they could send instructions to the courts and all charges against me would be dropped,” he said. “We’ll give you a new identity, money, everything you need – just help the state, that’s all. They always referred to themselves as the state.”</p> \n<p>One day he was taken by car back to the center of Ankara and released. He quickly went underground, and when he got a chance, he fled to Europe. “Neither myself nor my family have gotten over the trauma,” he said. “These people use all the state’s power.”</p> \n<p>Ali also worked at an institution associated with Gulen, and was abducted in broad daylight in a city in western Turkey. He was missing for a long time. He too says he was kept in a small cell in a large facility he couldn’t identify. Every day he was interrogated and tortured for hours. He says he was forced to stand for hours with his head in a sack, and when he collapsed he was told to stand up.</p> \n<p>“They told me I’m a terrorist and accused me of all sorts of things,” he said in his interview. “When the government doesn’t have enemies, they can’t steer the country in the direction they want to.”</p> \n<p>Ali said it seemed that the interrogators had many sources of information, and that they had detailed knowledge about his children. After his release, Ali also managed to flee to Western Europe, where he received refugee status.</p> \n<p>Concerns about the fate of Turkish citizens who have disappeared drove the director of Human Rights Watch in Europe and Central Asia, Hugh Williamson, to write to Turkey’s justice minister in August. Williamson called for an urgent investigation, saying there was reason to believe that government agents had abducted the missing persons.</p> \n<p>In addition, family members have appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which in turn asked the Turkish government to clarify whether government agents had taken part in abductions. Also, last year, members of the largest opposition party, the Republican People’s Party, called on then-Prime Minister Binali Yildirim to release information on the investigation of 11 civilians thought to have been “disappeared.”</p> \n<p>The United Nations defines “forced disappearance” as an instance in which a person’s liberty is denied by agents working for a government that later denies any involvement while refusing to divulge information on the whereabouts or fate of the abducted person.</p> \n<p>This isn’t a new phenomenon in Turkey. At the height of the government’s campaign against the Kurds in the 1990s, hundreds of civilians disappeared, according to UN sources. Ozturk Turkdogan, a lawyer who heads Turkey’s Human Rights Association, which represents families of people who have gone missing, told researchers that “apparently this practice is in use again.”</p> \n<p>It is of course hard to ascertain how many people have been kidnapped. But the Stockholm Center for Freedom, which was established by journalists who fled Turkey after the coup attempt, says that since 2016, 20 such cases have been reported of academics, teachers and public servants.</p> \n<p>One case sounds similar to Tolga and Ali’s stories. According to Politico, witnesses saw Onder Asan, a former teacher who lived in Ankara, being taken into a black car in April 2017. After 42 days in which nothing was known about his fate, he was located in a regular police facility, Politico said.</p> \n<p>According to the Stockholm Center for Freedom, Asan told his attorney that he was interrogated and tortured at an unknown location, with no access to the outer world, and that after his release he was told to give himself up to the police. Various media outlets have also provided testimony by another man, Cemil Kocak, who had been abducted by three men in Ankara.</p> \n<p>Turkdogan, the attorney who represents families of the missing, said he had transferred the information he had to a UN committee dealing with forced disappearances, as well as to a committee on human rights in Turkey’s parliament, and to the Turkish state prosecution. He says law enforcement agencies in Turkey were making no progress in investigating these cases.</p> \n<p>Abductions abroad</p> \n<p>Turkey gives no details on civilians who have disappeared on its territory. It does, however, publish information on Turkish citizens associated with Gulen who have been arrested in other countries and brought back to Turkey by the country’s MIT intelligence service. According to reports in various countries, such operations have taken place in Kosovo, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Gabon and Ukraine.</p> \n<p>Such operations are described in the Turkish media as the “return of terrorists.” Erdogan referred to this issue in a speech in Ankara in July to party members: “We’ll return Gulen’s people who fled, thinking they’re safe, one by one,” he declared. “We’ll continue our battle against Gulen supporters who have seriously harmed our country socially, politically and economically, until we completely eradicate them.”</p> \n<p>Even though Turkey announced that it was undertaking such operations, it’s unclear how they are carried out. Some details may be gleaned from a widely reported incident that occurred in March in Kosovo.</p> \n<p>Early one morning, a jet with the tail marking TC-KLE landed in the capital Pristina. Two hours later it took off with six Turkish citizens, five of them teachers, landing later at an airbase in Ankara. The wife of one of the men said her husband had been abducted by local men who had presented themselves as policemen, after stopping him on the highway in a village near Pristina.</p> \n<p>The plane used in Kosovo is owned by the Turkish tourism and construction company Birlesik insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi. It is registered in Ankara; its address is an apartment building belonging to the Turkish intelligence service, near its headquarters. According to a website that monitors planes, the jet that was used for the alleged abduction was seen in September parked next to Erdogan’s plane while he was visiting Germany. According to the website ADS-B-Exchange, which monitors flights, in early December the plane landed in Venezuela while Erdogan was visiting that country.</p> \n<p>Also, in widely reported incident in July, there was a foiled attempt to bring a school principal back from Mongolia to Turkey. He was working in a school associated with Gulen in the capital Ulan Bator. After the man was arrested, his family complained in the media and at the last minute the Mongolian government prevented the plane that had been sent from Turkey from taking off. The jet, photographed by the media, had the tail marking TT-4010.

        "text":["<p>Yigal Bashan, one of Israel’s most beloved musicians, died on Sunday at the age of 68. He was found dead at his home at about 4 P.M., and an ambulance crew was unable to revive him.</p> \n<p>As both a singer and composer, he was responsible for many classic Israeli songs, including “Sivan,” “Eretz Hatzabar” and “Anachnu Nisharim Ba’aretz.”</p> \n<p>In 2016, Bashan won a lifetime achievement award from ACUM, the Israeli society of authors, composers and music publishers. In its decision, the prize jury said he was behind “a long list of canonical hits sung by everyone.” His music was “a combination of east and west,” it added, and he was “one of the first to invent the new Israeli style, from the 1960s until today.”</p> \n<p>In his acceptance speech, Bashan said that upon receiving such a prize, “People tell you, ‘rest, enjoy, the work will get along without you.’ But a lifetime achievement prize gives me the desire to launch another endeavor.”</p> \n<p>Bashan, born Yigal Bashari, began his musical career at age 15, when he and a classmate, Shlomit Aharon, formed the duo Yigal and Shlomit. But his breakthrough came at age 17, when he starred in the musical “I Like Mike” in 1968.</p> \n<p>After doing his army service as part of an entertainment troupe, he solidified his status in the music world with a series of hits, including “Tzipor Ktana Balev” and “Kaffe Etzel Bertha.”</p> \n<p>In 1974, he co-starred with Dalia Friedland in George Obadiah’s film “Sarit,” for which he wrote and performed the soundtrack. Later that decade, he went abroad to fulfill a contract to make four records in English.</p> \n<p>After returning to Israel a few years later, his career seemed to be at a standstill. But then he recorded the hit “Sivan.”</p> \n<p>In 1985, the Kmo Tzo’anim trio, of which he was part, lost the contest to represent Israel in the Eurovision by a single point with a song of the same name. In response, the trio wrote “Anachnu Nisharim Ba’aretz” (“We’re Staying in Israel”), which was even more popular than their Eurovision entry.</p> \n<p>The trio later starred in the children’s television show “Hopa Hey,” which aired until 1995.</p> \n<p>In an interview with Haaretz in 2009, Bashan said, “I’d like to sing and write even at age 110. The question is whether people will want to listen. To this day, I don’t take that for granted.”</p> \n<p>But in 2014, he was hospitalized with stab wounds, and an investigation later concluded that they were self-inflicted.</p> \n<p>After Bashan’s death was announced, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin both published statements eulogizing him.</p> \n<p>“I deeply regret his passing,” Netanyahu wrote on Twitter. “His voice and his songs will continue to accompany us for many years to come. In the name of all Israeli citizens, I send my condolences to his family.”</p> \n<p>Rivlin said, “Dear Yigal, you were a comet that disappeared before our eyes, but the shards of light spread by your songs and your voice will always remain with us.” Describing Bashan as “the man with the warm voice who made us long for something we couldn’t even name,” Rivlin added that his talents as a soloist never interfered with Bashan’s ability to sing as part of a group.</p> \n<p>The Israeli Union of Performing Artists said in a statement, “We are shocked and grieved at the death of our beloved Yigal Bashan ... His contribution to Israel’s cultural heritage was enormous, spanning many years and many ages, communities and genres. His sudden loss is unbearable.”</p> \n<p>Bashan is survived by his wife of more than 40 years, fashion designer Mika Bashan, and two children.</p>",

It is the first time she has traveled as part of an official delegation without the prime minister.</p> \n<p>Asked who was funding the visit, the Prime Minister’s Office said, “Funding for accommodations and transport in Guatemala is by the Guatemalan government. The Foreign Ministry and other government ministries annually fund flights by Israeli citizens, including artists, writers and sportsmen, to represent Israel. The budget will be in accordance with actual expenses and will be finalized at the end of the visit.”</p> \n<p>Mendelblit, in a statement released by the Justice Ministry spokesman, said, “The attorney general stated that under current Israeli law, the wife of the prime minister is accorded no special legal status. As such, so long as the Foreign Ministry director general believes that there is justification for having the prime minister’s wife be part of the Foreign Ministry delegation to Guatemala, it should be arranged in accordance with the financial regulations that deal with foreign travel by those who aren’t state employees.”</p> \n<p>Foreign Ministry Director General Yuval Rotem indeed approved Sara Netanyahu’s participation from a diplomatic perspective, though it should be noted that Sara’s husband is also foreign minister. The Foreign Ministry said, “Mrs. Netanyahu’s trip was approved legally, administratively and diplomatically by all the authorized officials.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is set to participate in formal events surrounding issues of potable water and aid to victims of natural disasters. In June, Israel sent rescue forces to Guatemala after a volcano erupted 45 kilometers from the capital Guatemala City. According to the Foreign Ministry, the delegation will participate in a cornerstone ceremony for the rebuilding of a village destroyed in the eruption.</p> \n<p>Guatemala was the second country to move its embassy to Jerusalem, after the United States.</p>",

Even more would use electricity. The Energy Ministry estimates that in the first 10 years after the program is implemented, use of electric cars would save the Israeli economy 45 billion shekels and natgas cars another 17 billion.</p> \n<p>Enabling factories to use natural gas would save another 8 billion, and a similar amount saved by power plants moving over to gas and renewable energy.</p> \n<p>The oil and gas industry, which is represented by the Israel Institute for Energy and the Environmental, opposes the government setting energy goals. “Technology is a means, not an end,” said Shlomi Parizat, an economist who wrote a report on the pan for the institute.</p> \n<p>Among other things, he said the crackdown on gasoline-powered car would cause 12 billion shekels in losses to the Israeli energy industry. He warned against the government trying to predict technology trends and said it was up to the automotive industry to decide what technologies to adapt and promote.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile officials at the Environmental Protection Ministry as well as green organizations have objected to the big role natural gas plays in the targets at the expense of renewable energy, especially solar.</p> \n<p>They claim that the Energy Ministry favors gas because the government shares in the profits from Israel’s natural gas fields and wants to encourage more oil and gas exploration by ensuring there is growing domestic demand.</p> \n<p>At a recent energy conference the Environmental Ministry Director General Israel Danziger called the plan a “sad joke.” He said renewables should accounts for halfof all energy by 2030, not 17%, “The energy economy needs to be based on the sun, not on gas,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Natural gas is being presented by the [Energy] Ministry as a magic solution to the problem of greenhouse gases, but research shows that in order to produce of kilowatt hours of natural gas greenhouse gases equivalent to more than 400 grams of carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere, compared with 43 grams carbon dioxide with solar energy production,” said Adam Cromer, CEO of the environmental group Green Insight.</p> \n<p>The treasury has also weighed in against the targets, saying the government stood lose billions of shekels of tax revenues it now collects in taxes on gasoline.</p> \n<p>Steinitz is reportedly ready to compromise on two key elements of the plan – on the number of electric cars in 2030 and the share of renewable energy in power generation.</p> \n<p>But he is holding fast to his demand that Israel cease using coal. He also insisting that all factories have access to natural gas, even though to date the government and pipeline companies have failed to meet even near-term targets.</p> \n<p>“They will find a compromise under which half or a third of the car imported into Israel in 2030 won’t use gasoline,” said one govenrment source, who asked not to be identified. “The Finance Ministry will cover thie difference from tax revenues collected on travel or entry into cities with car as they do in London.”</p>",

The amount of support depends on the frequency of the flights. El Al will receive a 250,000-euro grant because it is operating the Las Vegas route once a week.</p> \n<p>El Al will also be opening nonstop flights to San Francisco as part of efforts to expand its service to the United States and Canada. Starting on May 13, 2019, the airline will offer three weekly flights to the popular city near the high-tech hub of Silicon Valley, and thus compete with United, which has flown daily to San Francisco since 2016. El Al’s new 787 Dreamliners will be used for these flights, offering three classes of seating: economy, premium and business.</p> \n<p>The San Francisco route was originally scheduled to start last month, but ticket sales were suddenly halted. El Al said the delay is the result of the accelerated removal from service of old aircraft, including a 767 that was damaged on the ground at Ben-Gurion International Airport early this year.</p> \n<p>The flights to Las Vegas will take off on Fridays from Ben-Gurion at 7 A.M. and land after 14 hours and 15 minutes, at 11:15 A.M. local time. The return flights will depart Las Vegas on Saturday nights at 10:45 P.M. and land in Tel Aviv 13-and-a-half hours later, at 10:15 P.M. on Monday.</p> \n<p>For his part, Tourism Minister Yariv Levin says inauguration of the Las Vegas route is part of a general effort to improve air travel to the United States. A record number of tourists are visiting Israel, with almost 1 million coming from the United States alone in the last year, he noted, and the new route will particularly contribute to incoming tourism from the western states.</p> \n<p>El Al’s new flights to San Francisco, some 15 hours in duration, will take off on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 1:05 A.M., arriving at 6 A.M. California time. The return trip, lasting some 13 hours and 40 minutes, will be on Mondays and Wednesdays at 8 P.M. and on Saturday nights at 10:45 P.M.</p> \n<p>As of next summer El Al will be flying direct to eight destinations in North America: New York, Newark, Boston, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas and Toronto.</p> \n<p>El Al CEO Gonen Usishkin says purchase of the new Dreamliner aircraft is facilitating the operation of longer distance routes, including a new one to Miami last year.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Italy’s Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is due to arrive in Israel on Tuesday and critics of his far-right, fiercely anti-immigration views in both Italy and Israel are voicing concern.</p> \n<p>Salvini, a close political ally of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n, is rapidly establishing himself as Italy’s most influential politician and as de facto leader of Europe’s populist anti-immigration camp in the run-up to European Parliament elections in 2019.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini’s League successfully ran on a nationalist anti-immigration platform promising to put “Italians first,” which critics called Islamophobic and xenophobic. Salvini routinely dismisses such charges as baseless, and repeats that his policies are just “buonsenso” (common-sense).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Critics in Italy’s Jewish community demand Salvini offer a clear condemnation of both Italy’s fascist past and its discrimination against migrants and members of the Roma communities during his trip to Israel. Progressives within Italy’s Jewish community have been circulating a letter calling him out on “attitudes and acts of racism in the public discourse in Italy.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Israeli left-wing activists are calling for a protest against Salvini during his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. They’ve promoted the demonstration with a meme showing Salvini’s face inside a washing machine with the caption: “Yad Vashem&nbsp;– an Israeli washing machine.”</p> \n<p>The meme implies Salvini is using the visit to “whitewash” his record in the same way other far-right leaders have allegedly done on recent visits to Israel&nbsp;– notably Orb&aacute;n, whose visit was met with similar criticism.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, when a similar call was issued to disrupt Orb&aacute;n’s visit to Yad Vashem last summer, it attracted only a small group of demonstrators at the museum. The Israeli activists promoting the protest at Yad Vashem also sent a defiant letter to the Italian Embassy, in which they quoted a call Salvini made last October to close all “ethnic shops by 9 P.M.” as one of the reasons why he deserves a hostile welcome.</p> \n<p>Seemingly aware of the challenge his visit faces, Salvini’s team enlisted the president of Italy’s Union of Jewish Communities, Noemi Di Segni, to join him during his Israel trip. The move, which some see as an attempt to lend Salvini legitimacy, will likely enrage some in the Jewish community who oppose the visit.</p> \n<p>Di Segni confirmed to Haaretz that she will join Salvini in Israel, specifying that she will definitely be at Yad Vashem. However, she declined to comment and added that her decision to join Salvini should not be subject to media attention.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“Italian Jews are torn between an appreciation of Salvini’s pro-Israel stance and concerns over his xenophobic politics,” said one Italian Jew from Rome critical of Di Segni’s decision to join Salvini, and who wished not to be named. “This is today’s dilemma for Italy's Jews,” they added.</p> \n<p>Members of JCall Italia, a group of progressive Italian Jews affiliated with the American lobby group J Street, released an appeal criticizing “the Israeli government’s posture vis-&agrave;-vis far-right parties and movements in Europe and elsewhere in the world.&quot;</p> \n<p>&quot;There is indeed an objective interest of Jews in fighting discrimination even when it does not hurt them directly and immediately,” the statement reads, criticizing the alleged Islamophobic tendencies of right-wing parties supportive of Israel “from Austria to Poland and from Hungary to Brazil.”</p> \n<p>The appeal&nbsp;– endorsed by some 100 Jewish community figures, some of them well-known&nbsp;– also includes an open letter with a list of demands to Salvini relating to his trip to Israel.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For instance, the appeal demands that while he is in Israel, Salvini clearly condemns the “trivialization of the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s by movements and parties belonging to the ethno-nationalistic far right in Italy and Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The letter also cites a Knesset speech by the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, Pinchas Goldschmidt, in which he criticizes Israel’s alliances with far-right parties in Europe, saying they are looking for a “certificate of purity for their policies.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Another statement circulated among Italy’s Jewish community said it is “alarming that [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu is about to provide Salvini with a pro-Israel license.” According to this second statement, sponsored by philosopher and painter Stefano Levi Della Torre, such a “license” could “exonerate him from the suspicions of anti-Semitism while he carries on with his xenophobic, racist campaign and with his alliances with anti-Semitic forces in Italy and Europe.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, according to Fiamma Nirenstein, a prominent Italian-Israeli writer and a member of the think tank Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the initiatives critical of Salvini are “simply absurd.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“I consider these initiatives marginal; Salvini and the League were always outspokenly pro-Israel,” she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Salvini’s League is staunchly pro-Israel and, defying EU practice if not official policy, his visit does not include a meeting with a Palestinian representative.</p> \n<p>In a Washington Post interview last summer, Salvini said he approved of Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the U.S. Embassy there. In an interview with Israeli daily Israel Hayom, fellow League member and Deputy Foreign Minister Guglielmo Picchi said Italy is considering opening a cultural center in Jerusalem, as the Czech Republic recently did.</p> \n<p>“I firmly believe the new anti-Semitism will grow out of left-wing populism and radical Islam, not from these kind of conservative movements. Salvini never did anything racist, fascist or anti-Semitic&nbsp;– so why call him that?” said Nirenstein, who served in the Italian parliament for the center-right party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.</p> \n<p>Nirenstein was tapped by Netanyahu to become Israel’s new ambassador to Italy in 2015, but the appointment was later aborted.&nbsp;Her thinking is representative of a portion of the Jewish community that is pleased with Salvini’s pro-Israel stance, and she shrugs off accusations that he holds extremists views.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>During his two-day trip to Israel, Salvini is expected to meet Netanyahu and dine with former ambassador to the United States and Deputy Minister Michael Oren, as well as holding talks with Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan.</p> \n<p>President Reuven Rivlin received a request for a meeting but declined to meet Salvini. A spokesperson from his office told Haaretz this was because of “schedule issues,” not “protocol.” Some European diplomats in Tel Aviv believe his decision could be, at least in part, political and quote a recent CNN interview with Rivlin where he spoke critically about Israel’s relationships with far-right movements.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Although Salvini’s League has no official links to neofascist groups in Italy, the latter are supportive of his policies. In turn, Salvini’s own statements do little to dispel concerns that such links might exist. And he often uses expressions that draw on the words of the former Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to provoke his critics. He also routinely mocks Italy’s famous anti-fascist resistance song “Bella Ciao” to celebrate victories.</p> \n<p>“Sovranismo” – from the word “sovereignty” – is a term Salvini likes to use and has recently become popular in Italian public discourse to describe the country’s new coalition government’s policies.</p> \n<p>Giuseppe Valditara, the professor and political scientist chosen by Salvini to head the Universities Department within Italy’s Education Ministry, called in a book titled “Sovranismo: The Last Hope for Democracy” for the creation of an international “sovranismo” movement against “globalism.” “Sovranismo” by and large refers to the belief that sovereignty should be restored to the people and away from international institutions&nbsp;– notably the European Union.</p> \n<p>When Steve Bannon announced the formation earlier this year&nbsp;of the Brussels-based The Movement –&nbsp;a foundation to support far-right parties across Europe&nbsp;– Salvini immediately pledged his support. Valditara sees it as the beginning of the realization of his vision for a movement of international “patriots.”</p> \n<p>Salvini's League was previously named the Northern League and advocated the separation of Italy's prosperous north from the country's poorer and underdeveloped south.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since Italy’s new coalition government was formed&nbsp;– the first in Western Europe to be led by a coalition of Euroskeptic, antiestablishment populists – Hungarian-born, Jewish-American billionaire George Soros has become a repeated target in public statements by state officials, notably because of his philanthropic work supporting migrants. On Saturday, Salvini slammed Soros during a demonstration in Rome, before warning that the “powers that be” want to “plunder” and impoverish Italy.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In keeping with his election promises, since becoming interior minister Salvini has attempted to block ships that rescue migrants at sea from docking in Italy. In June, Salvini refused to let a search-and-rescue vessel dock in Italy after it had rescued hundreds of migrants near the shores of Libya. His recent security decree was almost entirely dedicated to cracking down on migration.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>In one of the rounds of fighting between the Israelites and the Philistines, the Israelites decided to deploy an unconventional weapon – the Ark of the Covenant. According to 1 Samuel, the ark was brought to the battlefield, but the outcome was catastrophic. The Israelite army was defeated and the ark fell into enemy hands. The Philistines took it to Ashdod and placed it next to a statue of their god, Dagon.</p> \n<p>But the ark was to have its revenge: The statue fell, its hands were cut off, and the Philistines were struck with a plague of hemorrhoids. In their despair, they sent the ark back up north to Israel. The people of Kiryat Yearim were summoned to pick it up: “And the men of Kiriath-Yearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord” (1 Sam. 7:1). The ark remained on “the hill” until King David brought it to Jerusalem decades later.</p> \n<p>Scholars are almost certain that the biblical site of Kiryat Yearim is the hill on which now stands the Church of Our Lady of the Ark of the Covenant and the convent of a French order, on the outskirts of the village of Abu Ghosh.</p> \n<p>Archaeological excavations conducted there last year suggest that the hill was used by the kingdom of Israel to control the kingdom of Judah, and not, as the Bible has it, the other way around. Research now shows that the story of the Ark of the Covenant that found its way into the Bible was apparently intended to be a symbol of the kingdoms’ unity.</p> \n<p>About two weeks ago, Prof. Israel Finkelstein, an archaeologist from Tel Aviv University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, presented his findings from the excavations at Kiryat Yearim to a meeting of the national academies of science of Israel and France. Finkelstein is known as the leader of the camp that opposes the biblical approach in archaeology. He vehemently opposes the view that the unified kingdom of David and Solomon existed and controlled extensive parts of the land of Israel.</p> \n<p>The Bible, according to Finkelstein, is a religious and political text combining various traditions. It was written in Jerusalem in the seventh century B.C.E and onward, during the reign of the kings of Judah, and therefore it glorifies the kingdom of Judah and belittles the kingdom of Israel in the north, whose capital was in Samaria. Finkelstein believes that it was actually the northern kingdom that was the stronger of the two. In fact, he says, Judah was a small vassal entity under the northern kingdom, and evidence of this can be seen among other places at Kiryat Yearim.</p> \n<p>The excavation at Kiryat Yearim was carried out together with Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicolle of the College de France and supported by the Shmunis family of San Francisco. The archaeologists began their research by observations on the site itself and of present-day and historic aerial photographs.</p> \n<p>“Even before we started excavating I saw that the hill was not natural; it was manmade,” says Finkelstein. His main argument is that the top part of the hill is in fact a mound that was artificially raised by four massive retaining walls that created a kind of platform, which was filled with earth. This is the “hill” mentioned a number of times in the Bible and it was Kiryat Yearim’s government center. Small parts of these massive walls were revealed during the excavations.</p> \n<p>Finkelstein discovered that the walls were built with great precision. “It’s 110 by 150 meters, and six to seven meters high. It goes from north to south and from east to west in a completely straight line, with an error in the range of one degree. That’s no coincidence,” he says. The huge investment and the care the ancient builders took in creating this giant platform hints that this was a large and important cultic center in the area. Eight hundred years later, King Herod would build a similar platform on a much bigger scale – the Temple Mount, one of whose retaining walls is known as the Western Wall.</p> \n<p>After the hill was proven to have been manmade, the scholars sought to date this huge project. To this end, they used a method called optically stimulated luminescence, which dates the last time quartz particles in the soil were exposed to sunlight. The results showed quite a broad range, from 1150 B.C.E. to 770 B.C.E. That is, theoretically, King David could also have constructed the hill.</p> \n<p>But the archaeological finds from the site, especially the potsherds, show that the hill lay abandoned at the time of David, and most of the activity there took place in the first half of the eighth century B.C.E., the period of the reign of King Jeroboam of the northern kingdom of Israel. Jeroboam, according to Finkelstein, is the most likely candidate to have built the site.</p> \n<p>Finkelstein reached this conclusion by ruling out others. Judah would have been the most natural candidate, but it was too weak and there is no other example of such construction in Judah during that period. Another candidate is Assyria, which built similar compounds in Transjordan, but it was too far away at that time (until the campaign of Assyrian King Sennacherib in 701 B.C.E.).</p> \n<p>And so Finkelstein is left with the most logical candidate – the northern kingdom of Israel. Finkelstein finds support for this theory in similar compounds that the kingdom of Israel built in its capital at Sebaste and elsewhere. The site at Kiryat Yearim, in his opinion, was a place of worship but also served as an administrative center for control over Judah and Jerusalem. “It is not baseless to say this,” he says, adding: “If we go into a time machine and move 800 years forward, we’ll see that the center of the Roman government of Jerusalem was also here.”</p> \n<p>The purpose of the Ark of the Covenant story, according to this idea, was intended to give religious legitimacy to Kiryat Yearim. It was told and written in the northern kingdom of Israel, was passed on to Jerusalem through the refugees who arrived there after the destruction of the northern kingdom, and from there it found its way into the Bible. Many other “northern” traditions can be found in the Bible, such as the stories of Jacob, the Exodus and the stories of King Saul.</p> \n<p>Finkelstein believes that the story of the ark reflects an ideology of unification between the two Hebrew kingdoms, but that Israel was controlling Judah and not the other way around. “The kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam developed a system of key shrines that were connected to its important traditions. The Bethel shrine was associated with the stories of Jacob, the Samaria shrine with the Exodus. Here, in Kiryat Yearim, was the shrine to the ark of the Lord that was connected to Kiryat Yearim.” It was located on the border between the two kingdoms, and situating an administrative center on that border was a “symbolic act of unification,” Finkelstein says.</p>",

You’re fake dogs.”</p> \n<p>The incident was far from extraordinary — I have experienced much worse abuse during my years of covering European Jewry and its problems — but I found myself recalling it Monday following the publication of&nbsp;the unsurprisingly grim results from Europe’s largest survey of Jews on anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>About a third of the 16,395 Jews polled this year in 12 countries by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights said they avoid Jewish events or places out of fear for their safety. A similar number said they have considered emigrating in the past five years because they did not feel safe as Jews.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The new capital of Israel | Opinion</p> \n<p>More than 80 percent of respondents&nbsp;said anti-Semitism was “the most pressing problem” facing them. Nearly 40 percent said they had experienced an anti-Semitic incident over the past five years, and of those, 79 percent said they didn’t report it because they thought doing so would be a waste of time.</p> \n<p>Vera Jourova, the EU commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, called some of the poll’s data “shocking” in an address she delivered Monday in Brussels during the presentation of the report.</p> \n<p>She vowed tougher action on anti-Semitic crimes, especially online, and called on all EU member states to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism, which includes some forms of anti-Israel rhetoric, because “you cannot fight it if you can’t define it,” she said.</p> \n<p>The respondents appeared more affiliated than the average European Jew, with 45 percent saying they eat kosher at home and 84 percent declaring they fast on Yom Kippur. A sample with more respondents for whom Judaism is a less central element of life may yield different results.</p> \n<p>But even for a secular Jew like me, the report was no more shocking than the presence of the armed special forces officers at our children’s Jewish kindergarten, where they block off the entire road twice a day, during pickup and drop-off hours.</p> \n<p>My reporting has made me so used to such sights – the result of several terrorist attacks by Islamists on Jewish institutions, including the 2012 bloodbath at a Toulouse school — that I was genuinely surprised by how disturbing this is to my wife, who is Jewish but rarely attends Jewish community events.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Anti-Semites for Zion, then and now | Opinion</p> \n<p>Certainly the head of the European Jewish Association wasn’t surprised by the EU report.</p> \n<p>Anyone who is shocked,&nbsp;Rabbi Menachem Margolin said in a statement, is &quot;disconnected from the reality on the ground.&quot;</p> \n<p>Like so many of the poll’s respondents, I also brushed off the anti-Semitic incident I had experienced without reporting it to police.</p> \n<p>After all, I do not believe Dutch police would have identified the man who accosted me. But if they did, he could have accused me of assaulting him and back his claim with false witnesses from his rally — who would land me in trouble.</p> \n<p>The refusal by Dutch police to even investigate a Jewish community leader’s complaint for assault did little to assure me that they have my back.</p> \n<p>The Dutch government’s resistance to adopting an internationally accepted definition of anti-Semitism was also of little assurance. Nor was a Dutch court’s failure in July to charge a&nbsp;Syrian man with a hate crime for smashing up a kosher restaurant while waving a Palestinian flag.</p> \n<p>These problems are not exclusive to the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>In France, where half a million Jews live and the volume of anti-Semitic incidents increased by 69 percent in 2018, such occurrences have become a “daily occurrence,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said last month.</p> \n<p>In the United Kingdom, the country’s former chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, said that many people in his community feel they are facing ”an existential threat” in the supporters of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sacks, one of contemporary Judaism’s most eminent representatives, called the far-left politician an anti-Semite. Corbyn, who has called Hamas and Hezbollah his “friends” and who had suggested that British “Zionists” are incapable of irony, has rejected the allegation vociferously.</p> \n<p>In Sweden, anti-Semitic harassment by far-right activists led for the first time since World War II to the shuttering of a Jewish community anywhere in the European Union out of security concerns. The dissolution of Umea’s Jewish community was a sad precedent in a country where Jews are regularly assaulted by Muslim extremists, often with Israel as a pretext.</p> \n<p>Still, the news out of Brussels isn’t all bad when it comes to the fight against anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>Last week, the European Council — the EU’s executive branch — made a declaration against anti-Semitism, calling on EU member states to shoulder Jewish communities’ security costs and urging coordinated action against anti-Semitism.</p> \n<p>And whereas some European governments 20 years ago took pains to deny the resurgence of anti-Semitism after the Holocaust and the reasons driving it forward, mainstream politicians in Europe today seem to be more conscious of the problem’s nature and more interested in confronting it.</p> \n<p>Significantly, Jourova mentioned in her address not only anti-Semitism, but also anti-Zionism – a reference that many believe would have been unthinkable only several years ago coming from a high-ranking EU official. She also mentioned “Islamist anti-Semitism.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Mayor of Haifa, don’t give in | Editorial</p> \n<p>Such rhetoric reflects a reluctant acceptance in Europe of the effect of the arrival to the continent of millions of immigrants from anti-Semitic societies in the Muslim world. Whereas many integrated seamlessly into European societies and adopted their values, others have rejected them and reintroduced into the mainstream anti-Semitic sentiments that have been suppressed in Europe as part of the lessons of the Holocaust.</p> \n<p>Labeled “new anti-Semitism,” this mutation of Jew hatred has baffled European progressives, who struggled to come to terms with the systemic targeting of one minority group by members of another.</p> \n<p>Watchdog groups say that the vast majority of violent attacks on Jews in Western Europe today come from people with Muslim background. But accepting or admitting this has proven difficult for some advocates of Europe’s immigration policies.</p> \n<p>Yet last year, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed that France will “not surrender to anti-Zionism because it is a reinvention of anti-Semitism.” It was the first time that a French president made such an equation.</p> \n<p>Following France’s lead, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries mounted formidable efforts to protect Jewish community institutions, in some cases leading to a reduction in incidents.</p> \n<p>Yet even under Macron, French authorities, who in the early 2000s downplayed the scale of anti-Semitic crimes, showed signs of relapsing. Last year, France’s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights asserted that it “had no evidence” to support what it called “the new anti-Semitism hypothesis.”</p> \n<p>In May,&nbsp;a study published by a German federal entity said that anti-Semitism in Europe is unaffected by recent Muslim immigration,&nbsp;prompting a prominent critic to call the report selective and flawed.</p> \n<p>As the debate rages on, many Jews like me are increasingly contemplating their futures in Europe – despite major steps designed to ensure our ability to live freely and safely here.</p> \n<p>Because amid polls, reports, discussions and declarations about the need to balance freedoms, for too many European Jews “freedom of belief and the freedom to live without fear remain distant aspirations,” as Michael O’Flaherty, the director of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, put it Monday during his address in Brussels.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The FBI is helping investigate an attack by several suspected white supremacists on a black disc jockey at a tavern in Washington state over the weekend, authorities said Monday.</p> \n<p>Seven men and one woman were arrested for investigation of assault, hate crimes and other allegations early Saturday in Lynnwood, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office.</p> \n<p>Investigators said the group entered the Rec Room Bar and Grill, tried to take over the DJ’s equipment, then beat him and stomped him while shouting racial slurs.</p> \n<p>They also injured an Asian man who came to the DJ’s defense, the sheriff’s office said. The DJ was treated at a hospital for a swollen eye and other non-life-threatening injuries.</p> \n<p>“The violent behavior directed at members of our community over the weekend simply because of their race is disgusting,” Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said in a news release. “The Sheriff’s Office is partnering with the FBI in hopes of getting the strongest sentencing possible for these hate crimes.”</p> \n<p>Court papers identified the suspects as being affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood. They were due to appear in court by video from the Snohomish County Jail in Everett on Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if they had obtained lawyers. Prosecutors have until Wednesday afternoon to file charges.</p> \n<p>Authorities say they believe the group, which included people from Washington, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois and Oregon, was in Washington state to mark the anniversary of the death of white supremacist leader Robert Jay Mathews.</p> \n<p>Mathews led The Order, a white separatist group, until he was killed in a shootout with the FBI on Whidbey Island, north of Seattle, in 1984. His followers refer to the anniversary as “Martyr’s Day.”</p> \n<p>Among those arrested was Travis David Condor, a former soldier from Pittsburgh who was previously sentenced to 90 days in jail for beating a homeless man with a baseball bat in Cincinnati.</p> \n<p>According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, Condor runs the hate music record label American Defense Records, and he was photographed attending the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, which turned deadly when James Alex Fields Jr. rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters.</p> \n<p>The attack on the DJ came just hours after a jury on Friday convicted Fields of first-degree murder and other charges.</p> \n<p>A message left by The Associated Press on Condor’s phone Monday was not immediately returned.</p> \n<p>Deputies responding to a 911 call at the tavern said they saw several people trying to flee in a white pickup; the driver refused orders to stop. They later pulled over the vehicle and arrested the six people inside, including Condor and Randy A. Smith, 38, of Eugene, Oregon. Smith’s hands were bloody, a deputy wrote in a probable-cause statement.</p> \n<p>Two other suspects were arrested after being found in another car that had left the bar, authorities said. The driver of that vehicle, identified as Vincent B. Nutter, 28, of Bothell, was arrested for investigation of driving under the influence in addition to allegations related to the assault. He refused to submit to breath or other tests, court documents said.</p> \n<p>Nutter has a lengthy criminal history in Washington which includes drug and gun offenses. In 2013, he was arrested following a manhunt that involved helicopters and police dogs; he eventually climbed 40 feet into a Douglas fir tree and surrendered only after firefighters blasted him a few times with a fire hose, according to an account in The Daily Herald newspaper of Everett. He was sentenced to six years in prison.</p> \n<p>The other suspects arrested were:</p> \n<p>—Nathaniel Woodell, 32, of Woodstock, Illinois;</p> \n<p>—Daniel Dorson, 23, of Corvallis, Oregon;</p> \n<p>—Cory Colwell, 34, of Eugene, Oregon;</p> \n<p>—Leah Northcraft, 25, of Raleigh, North Carolina; and</p> \n<p>—Guy Miller, 37, of Tacoma.</p> \n<p>Northcraft did not participate in the assault but did yell slurs and threats and thus was arrested for investigation of malicious harassment, the state’s hate crime law, deputies said. A message to a phone number listed for her was not immediately returned.</p> \n<p>The suspects were being held on $15,000 bail, except for Colwell, who was released on his own recognizance, according to the Snohomish County Prosecutor’s Office.</p>",

        "text":["<p>When U.S. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez revealed on Sunday her recent discovery of her own Jewish heritage, it should not have been a great shock to anyone.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the five centuries that have passed since the Jews of both Spain and Portugal were forced to choose between conversion to Christianity or expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula, the number of descendants they have in Latin American alone has grown to an estimated 65 million.</p> \n<p>In the case of the 29-year-old democratic socialist who won New York’s 14th Congressional District in November, Ocasio-Cortez explained to an audience gathered for a Hanukkah candle-lighting in Queens that she had learned about her Jewish connection by “doing a lot of family trees in the last couple of years.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;'So What, You’re pro-BDS':&nbsp;Ben Shapiro slams Ocasio-Cortez after Jewish roots reveal</p> \n<p>Both of her parents are of Puerto Rican descent, and the first Jews are likely to have set foot on the Caribbean island in 1493 when Christopher Columbus visited it during his second voyage to the New World. (Columbus initially named it San Juan Bautista.)&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are many different theories and legends about Jews having sailed with Columbus – and even speculation that the great explorer himself was Jewish. What is clear is that his first journey to the New World set sail from Spain in early August 1492, which is also when the deadline passed for the country’s Jews to leave the country. It is likely that his crew included Jews who had waited until the last minute to flee Spain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The direct antecedent to the Expulsion took place a full century before 1492, when the Jews of Castile, Aragon and beyond came under violent pressure to convert to Christianity.</p> \n<p>Rioting against Jews in Seville in August 1391 spread throughout the peninsula, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Jews but also in the conversions of many thousands more. Many of those who elected to convert were well-regarded rabbis and teachers, which in turn encouraged other Jews to do the same.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Over the next hundred years – and culminating with the Expulsion – an estimated 200,000 or more Spanish Jews at least nominally converted to Christianity. They were called New Christians. Between 50,000 and 100,000 are thought to have gone into exile, many of them to Portugal (which at the time was still relatively tolerant of Jewish practice).&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Some of the New Christians were sincere in their adoption of the Christian faith, while others continued to cling to Jewish beliefs and/or practices in secret, even as they presented themselves in public as Catholics.</p> \n<p>The hatred and fear of insincere converts – referred to as crypto-Jews or Marranos (meaning “pigs”) – may have been more invidious even than hatred of Jews who refused to give up their faith. It was for the purpose of exposing secret “Judaizers,” as well as to root out heretics of every other shape and kind, that the Spanish Inquisition was established in 1480. The Jews who converted to Christianity under the pressure of the Spanish Inquisition&nbsp;later became known as conversos.</p> \n<p>By the turn of the century, Portugal too had lost its tolerance for Jews, and the thousands of Jews who had fled there from Spain were now compelled either to convert or go into exile. In short order, an Inquisition was also established in Portugal to root out heretics.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The prohibition on Jews extended to Spain and Portugal’s territories in the New World. But the journey across the Atlantic offered both great commercial opportunities and the possibility of starting a new life, whether as a converso or a crypto-Jew.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In fact, the Catholic Church granted Spain permission to establish the apparatus of the Inquisition in its Latin American colonies, and suspected heretics were subject to arrest, torture and often execution. However, it was relatively easy to escape detection outside of major urban areas.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It has been estimated that some 10 percent of the Spanish and Portuguese settlers in Latin America were of Sephardic background, although their distribution was not uniform.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>DNA tests, which offer the opportunity to detect certain genetic markers that are common to both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, have been helpful in recent years in pinpointing regions where Iberian Jews apparently settled. These include the Serid&oacute; region of Brazil, the River Plate basin in Argentina, and sections of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador. Similarly, it is known that many Jews settled in the remote northern states of Mexico and in what are today the Southwest states of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, then, it is in parts of the U.S. Southwest – for example, New Mexico and Colorado – where there are large numbers of people who have family traditions saying they are descended from Jews.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In other cases, there are families that preserved certain practices reminiscent of Jewish customs without necessarily knowing they had any connection with Judaism. For example, New Christians across much of the region created a putatively Catholic feast day called the Festival of Saint Esterica, which mimicked the Jewish feast of Purim.</p> \n<p>Just as Esther in the biblical book bearing her name fasted for three days before her meeting with the king, anusim women in Latin America would also fast for three days at the outset of Saint Esterica’s holiday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It was often the women who sustained the Jewish customs – lighting candles on the Sabbath, keeping a Hanukkah menorah in the home, keeping some of the Jewish dietary laws. But because secrecy was necessary, at least so long as the Inquisition continued, into the 19th century the origins of such customs were not openly discussed. Only in rare and remote communities – like Belmonte in Portugal and in Majorca, where the Xueta Jews live – did the Jews consciously maintain their traditions and marry only other members of their group.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ocasio-Cortez has identified as Catholic, and gave no indication Sunday that she intends to begin living as a Jew. But she told her audience at the Jewish Center of Jackson Heights that “a very, very long time ago, generations and generations ago, my family consisted of Sephardic Jews,” and this fact in itself seemed to provide her with satisfaction.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>“A strong group of people, who wanted to continue living life the way they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat and leave Spain,” she added. “Some of these people ended up in Puerto Rico.”</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico only allowed Jews to openly practice their faith at the turn of the 20th century, following the Spanish-American War of 1898. And it was only after the rise of the Nazis in Europe that Jewish immigration to the island began in earnest, in the 1930s and '40s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Hebrew University demographer Sergio DellaPergola estimated in 2016 that Puerto Rico is home to between 1,500 and 2,500 Jews (although that number may have fallen since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017). Despite its small number, the Jewish community includes members of the Orthodox, Conservative and Reform streams.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The capital, San Juan, is also home to three active synagogues – though they may have to wait a while before Ocasio-Cortez makes an appearance.</p>",

There are roughly 3.5 million direct descendants of those expelled from Spain in 1492, living in countries like Israel, France, the United States, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina and Chile.</p> \n<p>At the event, which was organized by Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and held at the Jackson Heights Jewish Center, the young congresswoman-elect reflected on this history: &quot;The story goes that during the Spanish Inquisition, Jews were forced, on the exterior, to convert to Catholicism, but on the interior they continued to be who they were, continued to practice their faith.&quot;</p> \n<p>She continued: &quot;A strong group of people, who wanted to continue living life the way they wanted to live it, decided to get on a boat and leave Spain.

Last month, she drew criticism&nbsp;for comparing&nbsp;the Central American migrant caravans at the U.S.-Mexico border to Jews fleeing Nazi Europe.</p> \n<p>In May, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that clashes on the Gaza border, in which Israeli soldiers killed 60 Palestinians, were a “massacre.” In a July interview on PBS, she said: “I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist,” and was “a proponent of a two-state solution.” She also&nbsp;criticized Israel’s conduct&nbsp;in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>Organizers of Sunday's event seemed pleased with her speech. &quot;I thought that it was beautiful, the reflection on her personal history and how we all collectively can work together to bring our hopes to the light,&quot; said Rebecca Seidel, a member of the organization behind the event. &quot;It was empowering to see her come to a small space that is built in the community and speak to us like her own people,&quot; she added.</p> \n<p>After suprisingly&nbsp;defeating a longtime incumbent in a Democratic primary, Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress. She is among a number of young progressive women recently elected to the U.S Congress and considered part of a new generation in the Democratic Party. She will represent New York's 14th Congressional District, which covers Queens and parts of the Bronx.</p> \n<p>After the event, Ocazio-Cortez said she hadn't planned to talk about her personal history tonight. &quot;I don’t always plan these things,&quot; she told Haaretz. &quot;But sometimes I feel the space, I feel the moment.&quot;</p> \n<p>Reuters and JTA contributed to this story.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A man who threatened this week to murder a leader of the Conservative movement in Israel has been located and is under police investigation, a spokesman for the Jerusalem police force confirmed on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>The threat was issued on Sunday morning during the monthly Women of the Wall&nbsp; prayer service at the Western Wall. Leaders of the Conservative and Reform movements typically accompany the multidenominational feminist prayer group during this ritual.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In a post on his Facebook page, Yizhar Hess, chief executive of the Conservative movement in Israel, reported that a young ultra-Orthodox man threatened him with the following words: “I will murder you, if I had a knife I’d put it in you here. If I had an ace I’d take it like this, in your head. You’re a heretic. It’s permitted to kill you.”</p> \n<p>Hess noted that he has joined the Women of the Wall prayer service virtually every month for the past few years but that “I’ve never experienced a conversation so violent.”</p> \n<p>“I was simply rendered speechless by the things that were said,” he added, “and it took me time to digest it.” A photo of the man who issued the threat, along with a video documenting the incident, was posted on Hess’s Facebook page as well.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Iran and Hamas threaten Israel's security. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish leaders threaten from within | Opinion</p> \n<p>The photo shows the young man surrounded by a group of ultra-Orthodox men, one of whom, speaking “with a thick American accent,” according to Hess, egged on his peer, saying: ‘”He’s right. You are liable for death. I don’t have the courage to do it, but it’s a mitzvah. If he does it, I will commend him.”</p> \n<p>Hess filed a complaint with police on Monday and was invited to provide testimony at the police station in Jerusalem’s Old City on Tuesday afternoon. “Our interrogation is still under way,” a spokesman for the Jerusalem police told Haaretz, “and if we find that there are grounds for pressing charges, that will be done.”</p> \n<p>This would not be the first time that leaders of the non-Orthodox movements in Israel have received death threats.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, envelopes containing written death threats were discovered at a vandalized Reform synagogue in the central Israeli town of Ra’anana. The individuals targeted in that case were Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism (the congregational arm of the movement in North America), Rabbi Gilad Kariv (executive director of the movement in Israel) and Anat Hoffman (chair of Women of the Wall who also heads the Israel Religious Action Center, the advocacy arm of the movement in Israel).</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is facing escalating criminal investigations in Washington and New York that are examining not only whether his campaign coordinated with the Kremlin but also whether he illegally bought the silence of two women who say they had sex with him.</p> \n<p>A look at the nearly three dozen people charged by special counsel Robert Mueller and unanswered questions about what may lie ahead for the president — labeled “Individual-1” in court papers — and his administration:</p> \n<p>WHAT’S THE LATEST?</p> \n<p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan for the first time connected the president to a federal crime, accusing him of orchestrating hush-money payments during the campaign by his longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to a porn star and a former Playboy model. Cohen is due to be sentenced this week.</p> \n<p>Mueller’s office, meanwhile, detailed lies they say former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort told them even after he agreed to plead guilty and cooperate.</p> \n<p>And prosecutors are preparing for the sentencing hearing next week of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who lied to the FBI about his Russian contacts.</p> \n<p>UNANSWERED QUESTIONS</p> \n<p>— Did the Trump campaign collude with Russia?</p> \n<p>That remains unclear, though there is mounting evidence of direct contact throughout the campaign between Trump associates and Moscow and evidence that individuals in Trump’s orbit were discussing a possible email dump from WikiLeaks before it occurred.</p> \n<p>American intelligence agencies and Mueller have said Russia was the source of hacked material released by WikiLeaks during the campaign that damaged Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential effort.</p> \n<p>Additional ties between Russians and Trump aides were alleged within the last week. Prosecutors revealed that a Russian contacted Cohen in 2015 and offered “political synergy” between Russia and the Republican campaign. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that that person is a former Russian Olympic athlete named Dmitry Klokov.</p> \n<p>Trump and his lawyers have returned a list of written answers on the collusion question to Mueller, but it’s unclear whether investigators will return with more questions.</p> \n<p>— Did the president obstruct the investigation?</p> \n<p>That is another unresolved question that Mueller is pursuing. Investigators have examined key episodes such as Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey and his fury over the recusal from the investigation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p> \n<p>THE AMERICAN DEFENDANTS</p> \n<p>— Paul Manafort: He has been convicted in Washington and Virginia of crimes related to years of Ukrainian political consulting work, including allegations he concealed his foreign government work from the United States and failed to pay taxes on it. Although the charges don’t directly touch Trump, he’s nonetheless remained a figure of considerable intrigue and enjoys the continued sympathy of the president, who has left open the door for a pardon.</p> \n<p>— Rick Gates: The longtime associate of Manafort and key Trump campaign aide was indicted last year alongside his mentor but months later split from him by pleading guilty to unregistered foreign lobbying work and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller. No sentencing date has been scheduled for Gates, indicating that his cooperation with investigators is continuing.</p> \n<p>— Michael Flynn: He has admitted lying to the FBI just days after Trump took office by telling agents that he had never discussed sanctions with the-then Russian ambassador to the United States. The White House said Flynn had misled administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about the conversation and ousted him weeks later. He’s since become a vital cooperator for Mueller, having met 19 times with investigators. Prosecutors aren’t recommending any prison time when he’s sentenced next week.</p> \n<p>— Michael Cohen: He’s at the center of not only Mueller’s investigation but also a separate investigation into hush-money payments. In Mueller’s investigation, Cohen has admitted lying to Congress about a proposed real estate development in Moscow. He told lawmakers the negotiations were done in January 2016 when in fact they stretched deep into the campaign. He also pleaded guilty in New York to campaign finance violations stemming from the payments, with prosecutors saying he “acted in coordination and at the direction of Individual-1” — Trump.</p> \n<p>— George Papadopoulos: The former foreign policy adviser recently finished a 14-day prison sentence after admitting lying to the FBI about a 2016 conversation with a Maltese professor who told him Russia had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of emails.</p> \n<p>25 RUSSIANS</p> \n<p>— Twelve military intelligence officers were charged in July with hacking the email accounts of Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic Party and then facilitating the release of tens of thousands of private communications. It remains perhaps the most direct example of what American intelligence officials say was a broad conspiracy by the Kremlin to meddle in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf.</p> \n<p>That indictment did not accuse any Americans of participating in the conspiracy, though it did include an eye-catching detail: The Russian hackers, prosecutors say, made an attempt to break into Clinton’s network just hours after Trump appeared to invite them to do so. In a July 27, 2016, speech, Trump urged Russia to look for emails that Clinton said she had deleted from her tenure as secretary of state.</p> \n<p>“Russia, if you’re listening,” Trump said, “I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”</p> \n<p>— A separate indictment charges 13 Russians with using a covert social media propaganda campaign to sow discord among Americans in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors say the scheme was run by a Russia-based troll farm that relied on bogus social media postings and advertisements fraudulently purchased in the name of Americans to try to influence the election.</p> \n<p>OTHER DEFENDANTS</p> \n<p>— Konstantin Kilimnik: The Ukrainian native, who U.S. authorities say has ties to Russian intelligence, was indicted on obstruction of justice charges involving Manafort. The men are accused of trying to persuade two witnesses to lie about the nature of political consulting and lobbying work they carried out for Ukrainian interests.</p> \n<p>— Richard Pinedo: The California man was sentenced in October to six months in prison for unwittingly aiding the Russian troll farm by selling stolen identifications and bank account numbers that were used by Russians to establish PayPal accounts and purchase advertisements on Facebook.</p> \n<p>— Alex van der Zwaan: The Dutch attorney became the first person punished with prison in the Mueller investigation when he was given a monthlong sentence for lying to investigators about his contacts with Gates and Kilimnik and about a report prepared by his law firm about the trial of a former Ukrainian prime minister.</p> \n<p>OTHER NAMES YOU MAY HAVE HEARD</p> \n<p>— Roger Stone: The longtime Trump confidant and self-proclaimed “dirty trickster” of Republican politics has been under investigation for months as prosecutors try to establish what knowledge he may have had about plans by WikiLeaks to release the stolen Democratic emails in the weeks before the election. Although a 2016 Stone tweet — “Trust me, it will soon the Podesta’s time in the barrel” — appeared to presage the disclosure of hacked emails, Stone has said he had no inside knowledge about the content, source or timing of WikiLeaks’ disclosure.</p> \n<p>— Jerome Corsi: A conspiracy theorist and Stone friend, he’s been under intense pressure from Mueller and even turned down a plea offer that would have required him to admit intentionally lying about a 2016 conversation he had with Stone about WikiLeaks. It’s unclear when or if he will be indicted, but based on draft documents Corsi has released, prosecutors appear to believe that he misled them about email exchanges involving Assange and the purloined emails.</p> \n<p>— Julian Assange: Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia inadvertently disclosed the existence of a sealed criminal complaint against the WikiLeaks founder, though no details have been publicly announced. Assange, under Justice Department scrutiny for years for WikiLeaks’ role in publishing government secrets, has been an important figure in the Mueller probe as investigators examine how WikiLeaks obtained the stolen emails and whether any Americans were involved in coordinating that effort.</p> \n<p>— Donald Trump Jr.: The president’s eldest son has attracted scrutiny for his role in arranging a Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 — also attended by Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner — at which he expected to receive damaging information on Clinton. He has said the meeting was a waste of time because he didn’t receive anything interesting from the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya. Both he and his father have suggested that anyone in that position would have taken the meeting in hopes of getting dirt on a political opponent. The meeting has been of interest to investigators, who have called multiple participants before the grand jury.</p>",

Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally, said that Lebanon takes the tunnel issue &quot;seriously&quot; and is prepared to &quot;take measures to remove causes of disagreement&quot; after receiving full report on the situation.</p> \n<p>Aoun added that the U.S. has informed Lebanon that Israel has &quot;no aggressive intentions,&quot; and also noted that his country too has &quot;no aggressive intentions.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Israeli army noted upon announcing the discovery of the third tunnel that it places the responsibility on the digging of the tunnels on the Lebanese government, and that it considers the existence of such tunnels a grave violation of UN resolution 1701.</p> \n<p>The Israel Defense Forces said that the tunnel was booby-trapped and that anyone who entered it from the Lebanese side &quot;would face a serious danger to their lives.&quot;</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about the revelation of the third tunnel on Tuesday afternoon, saying: &quot;Hezbollah thought it was digging uninterrupted. We knew about it and planned it [to launch Operation Northern Shield] and it didn't leak. We're carrying out exactly what we planned, but we are also prepared for setbacks.&quot;</p> \n<p>The premier spoke after holding a security assessment in the Northern Command along with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot and other senior commanders. Netanyahu, who is acting as defense minister following the resignation of Avigdor Lieberman, received a security briefing on the current progress in the operation to destroy the tunnels.</p> \n<p>&quot;We are systematically dismantling the tunnels,&quot; Netanyahu added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;The most important thing is the preparation here for a very strong reaction should Hezbollah make the big mistake of deciding to hurt us or resist what we are doing. Hezbollah will take blows it can't even begin to imagine,&quot; the prime minister continued.</p> \n<p>Also on Tuesday, an Israeli delegation of senior military officers is scheduled to leave for Moscow to&nbsp;meet their Russian counterparts&nbsp;and discuss operations to destroy Hezbollah-built cross-border tunnels.</p> \n<p>The trip is set to be the first meeting between Israeli and Russian officials since September 20, when an Israeli delegation traveled to Moscow in an attempt to ease tensions caused by&nbsp;an incident in which&nbsp;Syrian anti-aircraft missiles&nbsp;downed a Russian plane&nbsp;while trying to thwart an Israeli airstrike.</p> \n<p>Haaretz's Amos Harel wrote on Monday that the Israeli operation&nbsp;has entered its explosive stage. According to Harel, there is no wall or fence separating the Israeli and Lebanese forces where the demolition is going on, and all it would take is one antsy Lebanese soldier to spark a fire that would be hard to extinguish.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The immediate extinction of the human race is always an option. The last reminder of that occurred just 23 years ago, in 1995, when Norwegian scientists investigating the Northern Lights launched a missile carrying scientific equipment that put Russian nuclear forces on high alert. The Russians detected an object whose high northbound trajectory would slam it into Moscow. The old Cold War protocol was activated: The suitcase with the red button was brought to the president of Russia. For long minutes, the possibility of setting off a nuclear war was in the hands of Boris Yeltsin. That’s a historic fact worth pausing over: The fate of mankind lay, at least for a moment, with Boris Yeltsin.</p> \n<p>That story is the stuff of which real nightmares are made, but also a terrific point of departure for a science-fiction film. “Mortal Engines,” currently being screened around Israel, has a similar underlying premise. The backstory is the so-called Sixty-Minute War that took place in the 21st century, when the countries of the world annihilated one another, killed off most of humanity and destroyed the natural conditions that make human life possible. The plot is set about 1,000 years later, following a global technological, economic and political restart. The new world consists of independent city-states like classical Greece, but with a twist: The cities move. They are predators that have adapted to a world devoid of resources with the aid of treads that render them mobile like a gigantic tank. At the start of the movie we encounter mobile London in hot pursuit of a small German community with the aim of consuming it like a kind of fuel. This is a phenomenon known as “municipal Darwinism.”</p> \n<p>London, with St. Paul’s Cathedral in the forefront, cruising through rural Bavaria, is a sight to behold. This is Christian River’s first directorial effort, but his long experience as a special-effects developer for Peter Jackson has prepared him well to create a world replete with movable parts. “Mortal Engines” draws its inspiration from steampunk, a sci-fi subgenre that mixes new and old. The Sixty Minute War was the formative event that eradicated most technologies and the bulk of civilization, hurtling the human race back to an era resembling the pre-industrial 19th century, but integrating new technological developments and archaeological discoveries of old technologies. In a world like this – Victorian and futuristic – a dogfight between a hyper-sophisticated plane and a hot-air balloon is routine fare. It’s a world in which brilliant engineers and inquisitive archaeologists are all potentially capable of discovering a game-changing technology.</p> \n<p>“Mortal Engines,” like “The Hunger Games” before it, is based on a series of novels for teens about young people who are born into a post-apocalyptic world that is simultaneously appalling and gorgeous. The new film is a pet project of Peter Jackson, who acquired the rights in 2009, when he was between two trilogies: “Lord of the Rings” and “The Hobbit.” It took some years before he got around to producing &quot;Mortal Engines&quot;; once more he chose New Zealand for the shoot and his regular crew. He also wrote the script with two regular collaborators, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. He entrusted the direction to his experienced special-effects associate, Christian Rivers, who won an Oscar for his work on Jackson’s “King Kong.”</p> \n<p>After the opening chase, we meet our two protagonists: Tom Natsworthy (Robert Sheehan, “Misfits”), a London resident who was born into the wrong class but enjoys a healthy obsession for 21st-century objects, and Hester Shaw (Hera Hilmar, “Da Vinci’s Demons”), a mysterious and scarred young woman who has snuck into the city to avenge the murder of her parents. Following her failed attempt to assassinate the head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine (Hugo Weaving, “The Matrix”), Hester finds herself outside the city limits, alongside Tom. Because the whole city is in motion, it’s impossible to return to where they'd been. With a hostile environment that’s filled with people who are trying to survive, the plot becomes a journey among different types of locales, as the pair discover how to join forces against Valentine.</p> \n<p>These sorts of blockbusters depend wholly on special effects for their success, and Rivers invests most of his efforts to that end. He’s learned from Jackson and the Hobbits that to create a world you need not only deep pockets and New Zealand vistas but also a highly developed, almost childlike imagination and a dose of compassion. “Mortal Engines” passes the test with flying colors. Its world is magnificent and layered, fusing past and future, nature and technology, in a manner both spectacular and charming. The action is rich with images and with large numbers of moving parts in every frame – verbally and metaphorically – which energize the journey.</p> \n<p>Even when the scene consists of a dialogue delivered in a room, Rivers reminds us that it’s not a static situation: The room is only a cell in a dazzling city-machine that’s constantly in motion. As such, the film offers a less violent version of “Mad Max 2.” The physical design of the city design is enhanced by the representation of the British class system, which is classically rigid. It’s still a democracy, but one that’s driven by a war for survival and thus peopled by bloodthirsty citizens. In the world of Peter Jackson, too, the occupation corrupts. The logic is that of a pleasure cruise: There are no unfortunates aboard, everyone is privileged, and the level of privilege is calculated by the distance from the window.</p> \n<p>Rivers was only 17 when he was invited to prepare storyboards for Jackson’s “Dead Alive” (also known as “Braindead”). In the 26 years since, he’s worked closely with Jackson, mostly in the realm of special effects, and the veteran director has clearly exercised a substantial influence on his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Rivers creates marvelously fascinating cities that fire the imagination. Not just London, but every city and town is an independent state, and Rivers clearly enjoys every moment as a creator of worlds. Each locale is constructed down to the last pixel and intersects with the plot as a place rich with its own cultural and technological history that brought it to this juncture in time. The encounter between cities, which is sometimes a physical collision between iron and stone behemoths, provides greater creative action than any Hollywood blockbuster this year.</p> \n<p>The problem is that it’s not enough to fashion a spectacular world and direct riveting action scenes. It’s also necessary to develop what’s usually called a “story” and “characters.” I haven’t read the book on which the film is based, but it’s really immaterial whether the problem lies in the screen adaptation or in the direction. The film lacks heroes, a villain and a narrative engine. Characters come and go with no explanation or logic, leaving behind a fragmented, confused storyline. Tom is a nice, polite London boy, Hester is wild and learns good manners through him, and Valentine, the villain, acts like an English aristocrat. After the movie it’s possible to imagine all of them having a drink together in a pub and talking about the weather. The trio is not interesting either as individuals or through their interaction. That’s possibly the greatest sin an adventure movie can commit.</p> \n<p>But apart from the non-story and the embarrassing dialogue, “Mortal Engines” looks great. It’s not a good adventure movie, and a comparison to “Star Wars” isn’t flattering, but it makes for great viewing. The bottom line is that Peter Jackson took a creative concept from a literary work, adapted it for the screen, wed it to an equally creative director with proven experience in creating worlds – and scattered a $100-million budget over the whole shebang. Aficionados of special effects and sci-fi will enjoy the wealth of images and will note that every dollar was put to good use. But even they, at a certain point, will stop gaping and being enthralled by the visual cornucopia, in the face of a story that instead of stirring the same sense of wonder, simply leaves you wondering.</p>",

        "text":["<p>New videos published on Tuesday by Israeli human rights NGO B'Tselem strengthen Palestinian claims that Mohammad Khossam Khabali, who was shot to death in Tulkarm last week, was fired at despite the fact that he did not attend a protest or a riot in the area.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Israeli military claimed that the 23-year-old Khabali was shot after dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks towards Israeli troops in Tul Karm.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the Israel Defense Forces launched an investigation into the incident.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>B'Tselem published footage from four security cameras that documented the incident. The videos – which were shot from different angles – show several Palestinians crowding on the side of a road as Israeli soldiers advance towards them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The footage doesn't show any riots or demonstrations whatsoever. It only displays several Palestinians standing on the sidewalk, and none attempt any violent act at any point.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Netanyahu is pushing the Palestinians into a pressure cooker, assuming it won't explode in Israel's face | Analysis</p> \n<p>The video then shows Khabali walking along the road while using a cane. He is seen walking away from the soldiers, and then, as documented in a different video, falling to the ground with his back to the soldiers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After Khabali died, the Israeli military stated that a riot in Tul Karm prompted soldiers to use riot dispersal means and then live fire, despite the fact that the aforementioned video, which was published immediately after the incident took place, showed that Khabali was shot in the back of his head as he was walking in the opposite direction.</p> \n<p>Responding to an Haaretz query regarding the incident, the Israeli army explained that &quot;during an operational activity of Israeli soldiers in Tul Karm a violent riot erupted and dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks towards the fighters. In response, the soldiers used riot dispersal means and live fire. It has been reported that one Palestinian was killed and another injured [in this incident]. When the army finishes investigating the incident, the conclusions of the probe will be examined by the military prosecutor. The incident is also being probed at the command level.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khabali, who was a resident of the refugee camp in Tul Karm, had suffered from phycial and cognitive disablities, his acquaintances said. He was known in the refugee camp as an individual who often sought simple, odd jobs to earn a living.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>According to other testimonies, after the shooting Khabali's friends were afraid to approach him. In one of the videos people can be heard shouting at a young man who was near him and who pulled him into a narrow alleyway nearby. From there a vehicle took Khabali to an ambulance, which transferred him to a hospital.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the incident a part of the ongoing executions of young Palestinians by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry also called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the circumstances of Khabali's death.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khabali's family members, however, expressed doubt that an Israeli investigation would lead to those in charge of his death being brought to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>A Christmas tree erected on Monday by the management of the Big Fashion mall in Ashdod is causing controversy in the port city south of Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Avi Amsalem, a deputy mayor of Ashdod and head of the local branch of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, condemned the decision to put the tree up, and demanded that “the disgrace be removed.”</p> \n<p>For his part, however, Mayor Yehiel Lasry said “the Ashdod Municipality does not interfere with commercial considerations of businesses in the city.” He did not take a position in favor or against the tree, which was erected along with a Hanukkah menorah at the entrance to the center on the same day.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the company that operates the mall told Haaretz that the tree was put up following a request by city councillor Eli Nacht, who ran in October’s municipal election on the slogan “Enough with Religious Coercion.” Nacht, who heads the Atid faction, said that many local residents are immigrants from the former Soviet Union who celebrate Novi God, the civil New Year's holiday, with a tree.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Jewish world - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The decision to erect the tree at the Ashdod center – for the first time since it opened, in 2015 – should not be interpreted as an act of defiance against Haredim, said company sources, but rather as an attempt to bring a European atmosphere into the country. Indeed, other shopping malls run by the same firm in the north of Israel have displayed trees for years, they said.</p> \n<p>The religious and cultural character of Ashdod – especially, the influence of Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox communities over the immigrant population – was a major issue in the recent election. The fact that the Big Fashion mall is open on Shabbat has led many local Haredim to boycott it in general.</p> \n<p>Until now, the commercial center has functioned &quot;without inciting and divisive symbols,” Deputy Mayor Amsalem wrote in a Facebook post late Monday. But the Christmas tree, he added, is designed “to harm anyone who identifies as Jewish.&quot;</p> \n<p>Display of the tree was not made any more acceptable by the fact that it was placed next to a Hanukkah menorah, which Amsalem noted was also only put up on Monday, the last day of the eight-day Jewish holiday.</p> \n<p>For his part, Ashdod resident Ariel Elharar, a reporter for the Haredi Kikar Hashabat website, suggested that the decision to display the tree was made for economic reasons – to give what he called “anti-religious” members of the public the feeling that the shopping center belongs to them so they will flock there in large numbers.</p> \n<p>“I used to go to Big on occasion, but I see the tree display as another nail in the relations between my public and the shopping center, and if everyone agrees on this, I think I too will stop going there,” said Elharar.</p> \n<p>David Mor-Yosef, a kashrut supervisor at a local store, said that putting up the tree was an act of pure provocation. Some of the merchants with whom he had spoken, who work in the mall, were surprised to see it, he added.</p> \n<p>In response, the Big Fashion mall said residents of the Ashdod area from the former Soviet Union constitute a major proportion of the center’s clientele, &quot;and beyond that, any additional word is unnecessary.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>For the record, Meng Wanzhou&nbsp;– &nbsp;the chief financial officer of the Chinese high-tech giant Huawei Technologies –&nbsp;was arrested in Canada last week for her involvement in violating American sanctions on Iran.</p> \n<p>But it’s unlikely the United States would have ever taken such an extreme measure at such a particularly sensitive moment in its relations with China&nbsp;unless there was something bigger at stake.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There is. The United States is engaged in a new kind of cold war with China – one not fought for military or ideological supremacy, or access to natural resources. Instead, it is a war over who will be the world’s technology superpower.</p> \n<p>Meng’s arrest sends a stark message to Beijing about how hard Washington will fight. She is not just a top executive; she’s the daughter of the founder of one of China’s biggest and most powerful companies –&nbsp;one of the few Chinese firms that can honestly claim to be a global brand. If Chinese technology is going to conquer the world, Huawei is going to lead the charge.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s no question that a lot is at stake in the U.S.-China rivalry. In the 21st century, technology is what drives economic growth. It gives the countries that excel at innovation a clear edge over those that don’t. Having vast reserves of oil or an old-economy industrial base doesn’t cut it like it once did.</p> \n<p>Israel is a key example of that. Our innovative abilities have enabled us to form close relations with powers, like China and India, that once gave us little attention. It draws foreign investment and multinational companies, and enhances our military power through cyberwarfare in ways unimaginable a decade or two ago.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Israel has emerged as such an important power in technology terms that the United States has grown concerned that our growing tech ties with China may hurt America.</p> \n<p>The country that leads in up-and-coming technologies – particularly artificial intelligence, the one that promises (or threatens) to change the world we live in more than any other – will enjoy immense power and wealth.</p> \n<p>America’s global technology titans – Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intel and the rest – not only generate huge profits and create millions of well-paid jobs, they also give America vast cultural influence. What Facebook does affects the lives of billions of people in Europe, Asia and Africa.</p> \n<p>We should be cheering America on in this war. Despite resentment over the abuses of user privacy by the likes of Facebook and the antitrust concerns surrounding Amazon, American tech companies are still far more respectful of democratic and market norms than their Chinese counterparts. They are answerable to elected officials and public opinion.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Chinese companies are free to engage in practices that would never be allowed in the West, whether it be internet censorship, widespread use of facial recognition technology or an Orwellian social credit system. Chinese employers even use brain-scanning helmets to monitor their staff’s state of mind on the job.</p> \n<p>Far from discouraging these practices, the Chinese government regards them as useful tools for maintaining social control.</p> \n<p>For now, the writ of Chinese companies and the government are effectively limited to their home country. But imagine a decade or more from now in a world where Facebook &amp; Co. have ceded control of global social media, search engines and e-commerce to Chinese companies: Chinese standards would effectively be the global standards, with America and Europe left to fight rearguard actions by banning the worst abuses in their home markets after they have been discovered.</p> \n<p>China is still a distant No. 2 in the technology race, as a scorecard created by The Economist shows. Using data from 3,000 publicly traded companies and some 225 unicorns (startups valued at more than $1 billion), the magazine concluded that China’s tech industry is 42 percent as powerful as America’s. That’s a big gap&nbsp;– but as recently as 2012, China’s industry was just 15 percent as powerful as America’s, according to The Economist.</p> \n<p>In the United States, there’s a pervasive sense of the inevitability that China will win the technology cold war. China’s emergence as the world’s No. 2 economy in such a short timeframe, and its government’s ability to set priorities and sail through economic crises, leaves the impression that its only way is up.</p> \n<p>The Chinese should be given credit for their entrepreneurial spirit and effective government. But China’s rise has so far been largely due to the fact that it started from such a low baseline. The transition to a truly innovative economy will be much harder to finesse.</p> \n<p>If I had to guess, China’s tech industry will look a lot like Japan’s and South Korea’s. They are manufacturing superpowers that make and sell some of the world’s most popular products, but lack the cutting-edge abilities that have made Silicon Valley what it is.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unless China can break the iron law of innovation, its technology breakthroughs won’t be coming from giants like Huawei – or, for that matter, because of government targets and spending&nbsp;– but from the startup ecosystem.</p> \n<p>That system can’t thrive simply by deploying vast human and capital resources. It requires free and independent thinking by engineers and entrepreneurs –&nbsp;and that’s just the thing the Chinese government loathes and seeks to contain.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump sought Tuesday to pressure Democratic congressional leaders into supporting his demand for billions of dollars to build his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, threatening to have the military build it “if Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country.”</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted the threat hours before Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi were to meet with Trump at the White House in an effort to avert a possible partial government shutdown on Dec. 21, when funding for some agencies is scheduled to expire.</p> \n<p>In a series of tweets Tuesday, Trump said immigration and border patrol agents and thousands of active-duty service members he sent to the border have done a “FANTASTIC” job. But he said “A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier &amp; less expensive solution.”</p> \n<p>Trump said he looked forward to meeting with Schumer and Pelosi, but claimed they don’t want border security for “strictly political reasons.”</p> \n<p>“If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!” Trump said.</p> \n<p>Walter Shaub, former head of the government ethics office, tweeted a reply, &quot;In their free time? Because they can’t use DOD’s appropriations for that. They are not the White House’s personal staff of coat checkers and gardeners. They don’t work on the leader’s hobby horses. This isn’t the Saudi kingdom.&quot;</p> \n<p>Schumer and Pelosi said Monday that Republicans have the power to keep the government open since they control Congress and the White House.</p> \n<p>“Our country cannot afford a Trump Shutdown,” they said in a statement, adding that Trump “knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House and Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement.”</p> \n<p>Republican congressional leaders have repeatedly said it’s up to Trump to cut a deal with Democrats, an acknowledgment of their inability to produce spending bills with Republican votes alone.</p> \n<p>That gives Democrats some momentum heading into the closed-door talks, which also could veer into Trump’s request for emergency funding for deadly wildfires in California and a Republican-sponsored bill to extend expiring tax breaks and delay some health care taxes.</p> \n<p>Before lawmakers adjourn for the year they also may consider a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller and a plan to overhaul the system for handling sexual harassment complaints on Capitol Hill.</p> \n<p>By far, the biggest unresolved issue is the border wall. Trump wants the next funding package to include at least $5 billion for it, an idea Democrats have flatly rejected.</p> \n<p>Pelosi and Schumer have urged Trump to support a bill that includes a half-dozen government funding bills largely agreed upon by lawmakers, along with a separate measure that funds the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Sept. 30. The homeland bill includes about $1.3 billion for fencing and other security measures at the border.</p> \n<p>If Trump rejects that, Democrats will likely urge a continuing resolution that funds all the remaining appropriations bills at current levels through Sept. 30, an aide said. The aide was not authorized to discuss strategy by name and requested anonymity.</p> \n<p>Trump said Friday that Congress should provide all the money he wants for the wall and called illegal immigration a “threat to the well-being of every American community.” At an appearance in Kansas City, Missouri, Trump accused Democrats of playing a political game and said he ultimately would win.</p> \n<p>“I actually think the politics of what they’re doing is very bad for them,” Trump said of Democrats. “We’re going to very soon find out. Maybe I’m not right. But usually I’m right.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi, who is seeking to become House speaker when the new Congress convenes in January, said she and many other Democrats consider the wall “immoral, ineffective and expensive” and noted that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, an idea Mexico has repeatedly rejected.</p> \n<p>Protecting borders “is a responsibility we honor, but we do so by honoring our values as well,” Pelosi said last week.</p> \n<p>Schumer said Democrats want to work with Trump to avert a shutdown, but said money for border security should not include the concrete wall Trump has envisioned. Instead, the money should be used for fencing and technology that experts say is appropriate, Schumer said.</p> \n<p>“We do not want to let a Trump temper tantrum govern our policies or cause the shutdown of a government, which everyone on both sides of the aisle knows is the wrong idea,” Schumer said. If Trump “wants to shut down the government over Christmas over the wall, that’s his decision,” he said.</p> \n<p>Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Trump is the only obstacle between fully funding the government and a shutdown.</p> \n<p>“Time and again, President Trump has used the government of the American people as a bargaining chip for his fabricated solution to his manufactured crisis,” Leahy said Monday in a Senate speech.</p> \n<p>Trump “wants to score a made-for-reality-TV moment and he doesn’t care how many hardworking Americans will suffer for it,” Leahy said. “This is not about border security. This is about politics, pure and simple.”</p> \n<p>House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Democrats were the ones playing politics.</p> \n<p>If there’s a better way to secure the border than the $5 billion plan Trump has laid out, Democrats “need to come with an alternative,” Scalise said Monday on Fox News Channel. “They can’t come and say they want to shut the government down for no reason because they don’t want border security. They’ll lose that argument with the American people.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>A ceremony in Jerusalem celebrating Israeli popular music was overshadowed Tuesday when a five-year-old sex scandal involving singer Eyal Golan led to protests against a Knesset caucus’ decision to honor him alongside 11 other local musicians.</p> \n<p>As Golan took the stage at the Knesset to receive his award, young female activists in the audience stood and shouted protests against him. They were countered by audience members supportive of Golan who chanted “Eyal! Eyal!” in an effort to drown them out.</p> \n<p>In a rather surreal scene, the protesters were escorted out of the room by Knesset security guards as Golan sang a romantic duet with the chairwoman of the caucus honoring the musicians, MK Nava Boker (Likud). As they concluded their song and Golan thanked Boker for his prize, she responded by squeezing his shoulder supportively and reassuring him: “We love you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Knesset Caucus for the Promotion of Israeli Music had spearheaded the efforts to present official awards for those making musical contributions to Israeli culture. Its chairwoman, Boker, attempted to paper over the dispute in her opening remarks at the ceremony. After personally escorting Golan into the hall, she declared that “Hebrew music unites us all and belongs to us all.”</p> \n<p>There was “no place more appropriate than the Israeli Knesset” to honor artists from various genres and ethnicities, and to emphasize that we are “one people, one state, with one fate,” she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the weeks leading up to the ceremony, numerous women’s advocacy organizations and politicians had protested the decision to include Golan among the honorees receiving a certificate of appreciation. They argued against officially bestowing laurels on an artist who had been accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls. The honor, they said, was especially inappropriate in the age of #MeToo and growing public outrage over violence against women.</p> \n<p>The group behind Tuesday’s protests, Lotem – a new, guerrilla-style feminist group –&nbsp; got creative to demonstrate its displeasure, hanging teen-size panties and bras outside of the Knesset ahead of Golan’s arrival.</p> \n<p>Last week, in an effort to prevent Golan from receiving the certificate, five Knesset members sent a letter to Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein, demanding that the decision be reversed. They said that honoring Golan was “spitting in the face of victims of sexual violence,” sending a signal that sex between adult men and underage women, “even when it doesn’t reach the threshold of being criminal, is somehow normative.</p> \n<p>“Someone who uses his fame to take advantage of minors, to drive them around in [a vehicle nicknamed] the ‘pussymobile’ and give them cigarettes and alcohol, isn’t worthy of being honored by the Knesset,” the letter read, referring to evidence in the scandal that led to the conviction and imprisonment of the singer’s father, Danny Biton, in 2015.</p> \n<p>Biton’s crimes involved trading gifts and favors – including trips to his son’s concerts and home – in exchange for sex with Biton and his friends. While Golan was not deemed to have committed criminal acts himself, the testimony and evidence gathered in the case painted him in a very unflattering light.</p> \n<p>Opposition to Golan’s award heightened Sunday when members of the Knesset Israeli music caucus rebelled against Boker, joining the call for Edelstein to cancel the ceremony.</p> \n<p>One of the lawmakers leading the protest, MK Mossi Raz (Meretz), said in media interviews that while he “appreciated” Golan’s musical contributions, honoring him in the Knesset after all of the accusations led him to believe that “we should find someone else to give prizes to.”</p> \n<p>In response, Golan’s legal team told a television entertainment program they had sent a letter to Raz, announcing the singer’s plans to sue him for 1 million shekels (about $265,000) if he did not apologize and retract his statement. Golan’s legal team has frequently threatened to sue journalists and entertainment figures who criticize the singer. Raz has publicly stood by his comments.</p> \n<p>Boker herself dismissed the pushback as “populist protests that have nothing to do with this event.” Her defense of Golan was echoed previously by Culture Minister Miri Regev, who said the singer “deserves this honor,” adding she was “proud” of his achievements.</p> \n<p>Both women cast the controversy in political terms, portraying it as an attempt by opposition lawmakers to attack the Netanyahu government. Fans of Golan echoed those sentiments on social media, accusing “leftists” of unfairly targeting Golan. The language at the ceremony was even blunter, with the protesters being labeled “left-wing s****.”</p> \n<p>Edelstein, meanwhile, did his best to skirt the issue, releasing a statement in which he distanced himself from the controversy. He said he had not approved the decision to honor Golan and did not possess the authority to forbid the caucus from honoring him.</p> \n<p>Many Israeli feminists are unhappy that Golan’s musical career appears to have suffered minimal damage from the fallout of the scandal surrounding him between 2013 and 2015.</p> \n<p>Golan’s father, Biton, pled guilty to taking advantage of teenage girls from disadvantaged backgrounds, bringing them to his son’s performances and home, and giving them gifts in exchange for sexual services for himself and his friends.</p> \n<p>Biton, the indictment read, was “using his family connection to Eyal to promote his standing among Eyal’s female fans and among his acquaintances, tricking the young fans and treating them disdainfully and with a humiliating attitude – as though they were objects to satisfy and serve him, including his sexual desires and those of his acquaintances.”</p> \n<p>Biton confessed to the crimes under a plea bargain and was sentenced to two years’ jail time. Golan was involved in the initial investigation and was initially placed under house arrest. Ultimately, though, he was not charged with having had sexual relations with minors. However, the stain of his involvement has remained.</p> \n<p>In a separate matter, he was convicted of tax evasion and falsifying records in 2014, for which he was sentenced to community service and required to pay fines.</p> \n<p>In addition to the Golan controversy, a further shadow was cast on the ceremony by the death Sunday of popular singer Yigal Bashan. Boker said Tuesday’s event was posthumously dedicated to Bashan, whose funeral was held the same day.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Birthright is experiencing a sharp drop in participation rates this current winter season, according to five providers who spoke to Haaretz. The downturn is mainly being felt in the United States, which is by far the largest provider of participants to the program that brings young Jewish adults on free trips to Israel.</p> \n<p>According to some of Birthright’s key trip providers, who spoke to Haaretz on condition on anonymity, the drop ranges from 20 percent to 50 percent – depending on the provider – in comparison with the last winter season. The winter season extends from December through March.</p> \n<p>Birthright has experienced drops in numbers before, especially during spates of terror attacks and violence in the region. But it seems a downturn of this magnitude, unrelated to the security situation, is unprecedented.</p> \n<p>The trip providers told Haaretz they were not entirely sure of the reasons for the downturn, but offered several possible explanations.</p> \n<p>One explanation was that because eligibility requirements have been loosened in recent years, young Jews feel less of a sense of urgency nowadays to register for the program. In the past, the program was open only to participants aged 18 to 26. &nbsp;In a bid to expand the applicant pool, Birthright announced a few years ago that anyone up to the age of 32 would be eligible.</p> \n<p>Trip providers have also speculated that the downturn could reflect the well-documented fact that young American Jews are growing increasingly disengaged from Israel, and have less and less interest in visiting the country – even when the trips are free.</p> \n<p>Recent studies have shown that Jewish millennials, who are largely progressive, feel less connected to Israel than their parents and grandparents because they perceive the country's policies as antithetical to their values. In particular, they cite Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and of asylum seekers.</p> \n<p>Last week, for instance, a petition signed by 1,500 Jewish students – demanding that Birthright include in its itinerary Palestinian speakers able to address the realities of occupation&nbsp;– was delivered to Hillel directors at over 30 campuses across the United States.</p> \n<p>The petition was organized by J Street U, the campus affiliate of the pro-Israel, anti-occupation advocacy group. Hillel, the largest Jewish student organization in the world, is a major recruiter for Birthright.</p> \n<p>“The exclusion of voices of Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel from Birthright runs counter to our core values,” the petition said. “On a trip to Israel, we should experience the country’s history and culture, but we should also learn about the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and hear the voices of Palestinians living under occupation.” Last year, Birthright decided to discontinue these encounters, saying &quot;further analysis of this module in the context of the educational trip as a whole&quot; was required.</p> \n<p>Last summer, left-wing activists organized several highly publicized walkouts on Birthright tours to protest what they described as the very one-sided approach of the program to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> \n<p>Birthright works with about 10 trip providers. Trip providers are required to recruit a certain quota of participants in order to maintain their status. If they fall below the quota two seasons in a row, they automatically lose their contract with Birthright. Last year, for example, the Reform movement lost its status as a trip provider because it failed to fill its quota.</p> \n<p>Several trip providers expressed concern to Haaretz that because of the downturn in numbers experienced this winter, they were at risk of losing their contract with Birthright.</p> \n<p>The organization, which was established in 1999, has already brought over 500,000 young Jews on trips to Israel. Birthright brought 48,000 participants to Israel in 2017, in what it said was a record year, following 45,000 participants in both 2015 and 2016.</p> \n<p>Despite the current downturn, a spokeswoman for the organization said 2018 would be another record year.</p> \n<p>Birthright did acknowledge to Haaretz, though, that its winter season figures were down. Asked how the organization could break a new record in 2018 despite this downturn and considering participation rates in the summer were unchanged, the spokesperson said the winter season extends from December through March. The downturn, therefore, would be mainly felt in 2019.</p> \n<p>The Birthright spokewoman attributed the downturn to the fact that winter registration opened during the Jewish High Holy Days, “resulting in significantly fewer work days for our recruiters.</p> \n<p>“While this affected numbers,” she added, “it was not indicative of our overwhelmingly successful year.”</p> \n<p>Initial indications, the spokeswoman said, show that 2019 will be “another remarkable year.”</p>",

In a statement released on Twitter, he warned that Iran is increasing its &quot;testing and proliferation&quot; of missiles and called on the Islamic Republic to &quot;cease these activities.&quot;</p> \n<p>“We will continue our missile tests and this recent action was an important test,” Guards aerospace division head Amirali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency.</p> \n<p>“The reaction of the Americans shows that this test was very important for them and that’s why they were shouting,” he added, without specifying what type of missile had been tested.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Iran's Revolutionary Guards: What you need to know</p> \n<p>The UN&nbsp;Security Council met last week to discuss the test, which the United States, Britain and France said flouted UN restrictions on Tehran’s military program.</p> \n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program in May and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. He said the deal was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.</p> \n<p>Iran has ruled out negotiations with Washington over its military capabilities, particularly the missile program run by the Guards. It says the program is purely defensive and denies missiles are capable of being tipped with nuclear warheads.</p> \n<p>Hajizadeh said Iran holds up to 50 missile tests a year.</p> \n<p>“The issue of missiles has never been subject to negotiations and nothing has been approved or ratified about its prohibition for the Islamic Republic of Iran in (UN) resolution 2231,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday, according to the Tasnim news agency.</p> \n<p>“Our defense doctrine is basically founded upon deterrence.”</p> \n<p>Under UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal in 2015, Iran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.</p> \n<p>Some states argue the language does not make it obligatory.</p> \n<p>Last month, Hajizadeh said U.S. bases in Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, and U.S. aircraft carriers in the Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles.</p> \n<p>The head of the Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said on Tuesday the United States was becoming weaker.</p> \n<p>“American power is declining,” Jafari said, according to Fars. “The enemies don’t dare bring up the issue of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and they will take this wish to the grave.”</p> \n<p>In October, the Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at Islamic State militants in Syria after the Islamist group said it was responsible for an attack at a military parade in Iran that killed 25 people, nearly half of them Guards members.</p>",

The wounded mother is still in intensive care, her prematurely delivered baby fighting for his life, and already both have been co-opted to promote the settlers’ real estate enterprise. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein didn’t waste a moment before insisting that the entire settlement of Ofra be made “kosher” (indicating, by the way, that meanwhile it is decidedly nonkosher).</p> \n<p>No doubt about it, their land speed is inspiring — and stomach-churning.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Seven wounded, one seriously, in shooting attack near West Bank settlement</p> \n<p>And if, God forbid, the baby dies, there’s no doubt that the price will rise further. The leaders of the “settlement enterprise” will certainly insist on honoring his memory with many more stolen acres of income-generating real estate, on which another proud Jewish settlement will rise, perhaps to be named “Fruit of the Womb” or “Fetal Heights.”</p> \n<p>How obtuse and insensitive does one have to be to exploit a young mother’s tragedy? But this won’t be the first or, unfortunately, the last instance of settler real estate activists riding on blood to fulfill their nightmare vision.</p> \n<p>The worst was Shaked, as usual. Her inability to control her mouth leads her to repeatedly issue declarations so revealing they’re ridiculous. Referring to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas by his nickname, here, word by word, is what she tweeted to her followers: “In response to Abu Mazen’s ‘terror price list’ we present a price list of our own. Every attack will strengthen settlement rather than weaken it, and every potential terrorist will know in advance that this strengthening of the settlements will be recorded in his name.”</p> \n<p>This seems to mean that terror is actually good for the settlements. Blessed terror gives this despicable “enterprise” a boost. If only terror would provide us with more and more steaming pints of blood, and another heaping basket of suffering and bereavement, the settlements will expand, increase and truly flourish.</p> \n<p>Over all this hovers the question that has never received an honest answer: Why, for God’s sake, are male settlers dragging their children and pregnant wives into danger? By what crooked right are they putting them on the front lines? Where do they get the chutzpah to project a false sense of calm normalcy to their families and induce them to come to territories without a trace of normality, a shred of calm?</p> \n<p>After all, these same people castigate those wicked Arabs who hide behind their women and children, send their young ones to the front lines and let their teenagers face down Israeli army sharpshooters at protests. Meanwhile, while they mock and condemn, they hide behind their own children and women, sending their young ones to the front lines and letting their teens go out and riot against Ishmael, while pretending to be peaceful citizens seeking to live their tranquil lives on land they plundered.</p> \n<p>Is it possible that they genuinely believe their own nonsense?</p> \n<p>Their ready answer is usually, “So what? Children get hurt within Israel’s borders, too.” Indeed. But those hurt in Israel are just ordinary civilians. The settlers, by their own admission, see themselves as emissaries, as functionaries. The vanguard of the occupation. The spearhead sent to expand borders, seize lands, dispossess the natives and make their lives miserable.</p> \n<p>Or, in slightly less polite language, the settlers are members of a land-theft gang that the world also views as war criminals. You don’t send a boy to do a man’s robbery job. The robber goes alone, so that he alone pays the price — not his young son, nor his pregnant wife.</p>",

From the start, the IDF spokesman has been stating that “the responsibility for the tunnel digging by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon rests with the Lebanese government.”</p> \n<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett agrees. “Hezbollah equals Lebanon. Israel no longer has to treat Hezbollah as an entity separate from Lebanon, as we did during the Second Lebanon War,” he said, adding that Hezbollah has become “a major part of the sovereign state of Lebanon.”</p> \n<p>But the Americans reject Israel’s formula, saying that despite Israel’s right to defend itself, the problem is Hezbollah – therefore the agreement for sanctions against the organization directly. Washington made clear that the United States and Lebanon have close military ties and there is no interest in undermining them.</p> \n<p>Thus, during Netanyahu’s tour of the northern border a few days later, he softened his remarks about Lebanon, saying that “Israel expects an unequivocal condemnation of Hezbollah and the imposition of additional sanctions on Hezbollah,” with the Lebanese government no longer letting Hezbollah use its territory for attacks on Israel.</p> \n<p>Regarding the new tunnel, whose exact location was not revealed, the army said it posed no threat to Israelis. IDF spokesman Ronen Manelis said that the route, “like the other routes, has been booby-trapped by the IDF, and anyone entering it from the Lebanese side puts his life at risk.”</p> \n<p>He noted that the IDF was examining the tunnel and added that “responsibility for the digging of tunnels from Lebanese territory rests with the Lebanese government. We’re talking about a serious violation of Resolution 1701 and Israel’s sovereignty.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu held a security assessment at Northern Command headquarters with IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, Northern Command chief Yoel Strick and other senior commanders.</p> \n<p>“Hezbollah thought it was digging without interruption. We knew and we planned and it didn’t leak,” Netanyahu said. “The operation will continue as necessary and is proceeding at a good pace, even a little ahead of schedule.”</p> \n<p>Netanyahu rejected attempts to play down the importance of the operation. “Think if we weren’t doing this; think of how on a cloudy, foggy day Hezbollah would emerge from the tunnels and kidnap our people,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Think of what Israel’s situation would be with Hezbollah campaigns of killing and kidnapping on our territory, something that hasn’t happened since ‘48. Understand that we’re talking about a very important step. Attempts to dismiss or belittle it are ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>Lebanese President Michel Aoun said Tuesday he had been informed by Washington that Israel does not have offensive intentions against his country, thus Lebanon had no such intentions either. “There is no danger to the quiet along Lebanon’s southern border,” he said. “We are waiting for the results of the investigation into the tunnels to formulate a position.”</p> \n<p>On Saturday, the IDF revealed that a second cross-border tunnel had been discovered. Manelis said work on that tunnel had been going on “right up to the last few days,” though the tunnel was not yet operational. Operation Northern Shield, launched at the beginning of last week, is expected to continue for several weeks.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It happens every night, with or without any apparent reason. It’s always brutal: a violent invasion of the home of a sleeping family, before the eyes of the women and the children, everyone abruptly awakening to a nightmare of dozens of soldiers, sometimes with dogs. An alien presence. The arrest missions of the Israel Defense Forces, perhaps the most salient sign of the routine of the occupation, are carried out both in times of unrest and periods of quiet. Hardly a night goes by without them.</p> \n<p>The raids take place across the West Bank – including Area A, which is nominally under the Palestinian Authority’s control – and always at night. Every decent Israeli has the obligation to try to imagine the scene: to be woken up in the dead of night by armed, masked soldiers, their rifles aimed at you and at your terrified children. Often the troops resort to violence, tying up members of the household and beating them. Sometimes they use live ammunition.</p> \n<p>At some point, they take someone, the wanted individual, into custody, with no explanation, no arrest warrant, no judicial oversight. In some cases, they don’t even let their captive get dressed. Days will pass before the family learns where he is, what his condition is, what the suspicions against him are. Or he might be released after a few days, again with no explanation. If he’s brought to trial, the charges against him will be revealed; some of them are real, others are invented or political in nature, as is usual in the military courts.</p> \n<p>In some raids, the IDF soldiers leave as abruptly as they arrived, not detaining anyone – the raid was apparently launched in order to sow fear or for training purposes. Sometimes they simply get the address wrong. There’s barely a Palestinian family that isn’t familiar with this practice. Israelis don’t get abducted from their homes. This is a feature of the apartheid system.</p> \n<p>It happened last night and the night before last; it will happen tonight, and tomorrow night, too, while we’re asleep. These are abductions, plain and simple – “arrests” is newspeak. In contrast to what happens in more benighted regimes, here the disappeared will reappear: The families are eventually able to locate their loved ones. Afterward, they can also see them in court. Helpless in the face of the juggernaut, the Palestinians have become accustomed to this reality and accept it with seeming equanimity, as an integral part of their lives.</p> \n<p>But generations of Palestinian children are growing up with fear, trauma and scars from the terror of those nights. The IDF doesn’t provide data about the scale of the phenomenon, but an unofficial estimate is that the number of people arrested during the past year reached some 2,700. The army does publish almost daily communiqu&eacute;s about the “booty”: how many were arrested the preceding night. Every person suspected of throwing a stone can expect a night visit of this kind, every Palestinian family can look forward to the unannounced arrival of these uninvited guests. In some cases no arrest is made; the raid was carried out to collect information, demonstrate control, maintain the troops’ vigilance, keep the local population in a state of constant fear.</p> \n<p>No one even thinks of summoning the wanted individuals for questioning – always, they are snatched from their beds, and their families are subjected to brutal treatment.</p> \n<p>This week, accompanied by Musa Abu Hashhash, a field researcher for the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, we visited two homes to which the IDF paid visits recently. In one case the soldiers shot and wounded the head of the household; in the other they raided a home where they’d killed the father three years earlier during a similar mission. In two homes, both in the Hebron area, the testimonies are similar, the questions they raise identical. In Halhul, we were received cordially by the Dawadi family, and in Beit Ummar, by the Abu Marya family. Neither family could understand why the soldiers behaved as they did.</p> \n<p>On November 5, a little after 4 A.M., the Dawadi family was awakened by the sounds of a break-in. A staircase surrounded by neglected vines and fig and pomegranate trees leads to the second floor of their two-story house, situated on a hill west of Halhul. Everyone was asleep, apart from two boys, Mahmoud and Lahmed, who were playing Babaji, the addictive computer war game.</p> \n<p>Searchlights illuminated the house as the troops tried to force open the front door by dislodging the lintel above it. About 30 soldiers surrounded the building and a dozen of them, all masked, burst into the ground-floor apartment, where Mohammed, 27, his wife, Manal, and their 2-year-old son, Nasser, were sleeping. They handcuffed Mohammed and questioned him about his brother, Muhand, who is 18. He lives on the second floor, Mohammed told them, along with the other unmarried sisters and brothers, and their parents.</p> \n<p>Waiting for the soldiers on the second floor were the father of the family, 52-year-old Khaled (known as Nasser at home), and his wife, Nawifa, 50. Khaled opened the door for the troops before they could break it down, and they streamed in without a word. According to Mahmud, 25, the soldiers became violent immediately, binding family members with plastic handcuffs and hitting them. They pushed Nawifa and daughter Kinda, 14, into the kitchen, threw Khaled onto a living-room sofa and shut the brothers in another room. Mahmud recalls the story now calmly, in fluent Hebrew; he had worked in Israel for eight years, only one of them with a permit.</p> \n<p>The soldiers took Muhand, whom they had identified from a photo they had, into another room; Mahmud says he heard them beating him. Finally they handcuffed Muhand and were about to leave with him. But he was wearing only underwear, and his mother told the soldiers that she had locked the front door and wouldn’t open it until her son was allowed to get dressed. Mahmud says he asked to speak with their officer. The soldiers hushed him: “You are terrorists and no one is going to talk to you.” Now he asks, “What law in your country allows you to behave this way? What is this, a mafia?”</p> \n<p>Finally, Nawifa managed to give Muhand a shirt and jacket, and the soldiers allowed him to put on pants and shoes. They walked down the stairs into the cold street. It’s not clear what happened there, but suddenly Mahmud heard a soldier say, “Pump him,” and then saw his father, Khaled, who had followed the soldiers into the street,slump to the ground next to the building’s entrance. No shot was heard – they must have used a silencer – nor was blood seen at first. Khaled was shot near his knee, at close range. Fortunately, the bullet did not hit the kneecap, only a muscle. He was taken to Aliya Hospital in Hebron and discharged three days later.</p> \n<p>During our visit this week, Khaled was in court at Ofer military base, near Ramallah, to attend a hearing for Muhand, who has been in detention since that night on suspicion of throwing stones and Molotov cocktails.</p> \n<p>“Put yourself in my place,” Mohammed says, his toddler son sitting on his knees. “My wife wakes me up and says she hears a noise, soldiers break in and aim their rifles at us and at our little boy. Nasser started to cry and a soldier shouted at him to be quiet. How could he yell at a 2-year-old boy?” Since that night, Mohammed relates, his son frequently wakes up at night and shouts, “Yahud! Yahud!” (“Jew! Jew!”)</p> \n<p>“Why does the army behave like that?” Mohammed asks. “We worked in Israel and saw that the Israelis can behave differently. What happens to them when they become soldiers? If they’d knocked on the door, we would have opened it. If they had summoned Muhand for questioning, he would have gone.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>A poultry shop in the nearby town of Beit Ummar. Khaider Abu Marya raises chickens in the yard of his house and also buys them in Jericho; he sells them whole for eight shekels ($2.15) a kilo in his store. On July 23, 2015, Khaider lost his father, Falah, 52, when soldiers invading his home to arrest one of his sons fired three live rounds into his upper body. From the poultry shop we drive to the home of the Abu Marya family, where the smells of a chicken coop and dead fowl hang in the air. Inside, the family tells us that Falah was killed after soldiers shot and wounded his son, Mohammed, and Falah had gone out to the balcony to shout for help. The soldiers made no arrests.</p> \n<p>This past November 6, the day after the Halhul incident, IDF troops again arrived at the Abu Marya residence. It was 3 A.M. They were looking for another member of the family, Muhi, 21. They entered the house by force and, according to Khaider, hit his brother Yihyeh. Their mother, Faika, screamed, terrified that another disaster was about to strike the family. The dozen soldiers were accompanied by a frightening dog. They demanded the ID cards of the family members, but Faika, utterly distraught, had a hard time finding them. The house was in the midst of preparations for the wedding of another son, Nabil, the following week.</p> \n<p>According to Faika, the soldiers attached an electric-shock device to Yihyeh’s chest and back, and beat him on the face until he bled. Hearing the shouting and screams from the floor below, Khaider’s three small children and Mohammed’s 18-month-old infant began to cry with fear.</p> \n<p>Eventually the soldiers left, taking Muhi and Yihyeh with them, even though the latter was not on the wanted list. Yihyeh was freed a day later. On the day of our visit to the Abu Marya home, a hearing was held in Muhi’s case, but no one in the family traveled to the Ofer court and he is still in detention.</p> \n<p>Asked for comment on the two incidents, the IDF Spokesman’s Unit provided this response: “On November 5, IDF troops entered the village of Halhul in order to arrest a terror suspect. When they arrived at their destination, violent disturbances began inside the suspect’s house. To carry out their mission, the fighters had to restrain three males who were behaving wildly.</p> \n<p>“On their departure from the house, a disturbance broke out that threatened the lives of the soldiers, who responded by shooting at the lower part of the body of one of the individuals leading the disturbance.</p> \n<p>“On November 6, while special forces of the Border Police were carrying out an action in the village of Beit Ummar, aimed at arresting a terror suspect, a member of the suspect’s family attacked the fighters. The soldiers responded by using a taser to hold him off, and, as he continued to present a danger to the force, he was arrested after attacking a policeman. Despite your claim to the contrary, no violence was used vis-&agrave;-vis other family members.”</p> \n<p>Nabil’s wedding took place as planned, on November 17, without his incarcerated brother. The family says they have no idea what Muhi is suspected of. A photograph of the late father of the family looks down on us from the wall of the living room in his house.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Dollar at two-year high versus shekel, but dealers say trend will reverse next year</p> \n<p>The dollar reached its highest against the shekel in nearly two years Tuesday, but dealers said the Israeli currency should reserve course next year. The dollar strengthened more than 0.5% Tuesday to a representative rate of 3.751, marking a gain of 10% since the end of January. The euro recovered, advancing nearly 0.3% to 4.272 shekels. The dollar has been gaining against nearly all global currencies in the past year as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates at a far faster pace than other central banks, including the Bank of Israel. “It’s not a local story about the shekel,” said Lior Faust, head of the foreign currency desk at Leumi Capital Markets. That said, the shekel has gained against most other currencies. Faust said the shekel will rebound over the course of next year because the pace of Fed rate hikes is slowing and concerns about political stability in Israel and slower economic growth should ease.

The investigation began in 2014 with a probe into the suspected price-fixing of two drugs, but on Sunday The Washington Post reported that its scope had expanded to at least 16 companies, including Teva, and 300 drugs. The price-fixing was coordinated by executives of the companies over steak dinners, cocktail parties and rounds of golf, prosecutors say. In a letter to Teva Chairman Sol Barer, lawyers for the shareholders cited Section 194 of Israel’s Companies Law, according to which if the company fails to take legal action against the suspect employees, shareholders can sue Teva USA. They claim the cartel will cost Teva hundreds of millions in legal costs alone. Teva shares ended up 0.6% at 69.49 shekels ($18.52).

Under the agreement, Entera will use its proprietary drug-delivery platform to develop oral formulations to treat inflammatory disease and other serious illnesses. Amgen has selected one preclinical large-molecule program and has an option to select up to two additional programs to include in the collaboration, Entera said. Entera will receive a “modest” initial technology access fee from Amgen, which will also pay for preclinical development. In addition, Entera will be eligible for up to $270 million in aggregate payments, as well as tiered royalties up to mid-single digits, tied to clinical and commercial milestones if Amgen decides to move all of these programs forward. Entera said it would retain all intellectual property rights to its drug delivery technology. Entera shares were up 4.2% at $5.20 at late morning local time in New York.

Whitestone soared 10% Tuesday after the U.S. property company said it had received an offer to buy all of its assets as well as assets of a sister company. Whitestone bonds, like those of many other of the 35 U.S. real estate companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, have fallen sharply, leaving yields at junk levels. Tuesday’s announcement contained few details, including the name of the buyer or how much it was prepared to pay for the assets. Whitestone said it expected the valuation would be higher than what appears in the company’s books. “At this stage the company and its controlling shareholders are examining the offer and engaging in talks on a deal and its terms,” Whitestone said. “In addition, the company and its controlling shareholders haven’t been able to verify the financial ability of the proposed buyers,” it said. Whitestone has issued 400 million shekels ($107 million) in bonds on the TASE.

The government stayed quiet and today another woman was murdered. Starting tomorrow, every day at 10 A.M., we will all stop everything for 25 minutes... until the government meets our demands,&quot; they wrote.</p> \n<p>The union representing high school teachers announced that it will join the protest, with teachers striking for 25 minutes starting Wednesday.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The chair of the union, Ran Erez, said: &quot;As teachers and educators who lead the struggle against violence aimed at educational staff, we cannot stand silent. The union has already announced its support of the struggle led by the 'Red Flag' coalition,&quot; uniting feminist organizations in Israel demonstrating against violence aimed at women.</p> \n<p>The protest was sparked after two teens were murdered in one week last month: The 16-year-old Israeli Arab Yara Ayoub from the Arab village of Jish in the Upper Galilee, and&nbsp;the 12-year-old Eritrean Silvana Tsagi, an asylum seeker from Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>The protest also lamented the Knesset's decision not to set up a parliamentary investigative committee to probe violence against women in Israel.</p> \n<p>Protesters are demanding that the government fund the plans suggested by the committee dedicated to combating domestic abuse. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that he is committed to executing existing plans, and has put Yoav Horowitz, his bureau's chief, and Deputy Finance Minister Yitzhak Cohen to the task of looking into the possibility of increasing the budgets allocated for existing plans.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>MK Aida Touma-Suleiman (Joint List), the chair of the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, spoke out Tuesday after news of Awad's murder broke: &quot;The families who have lost their dearest, an hour ago, are families I know and I can't imagine how they will bear this pain.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Arab feminists in Israel refuse to let the struggle fade&nbsp;■&nbsp;How anti-femicide protest is uniting women in Israel's Arab and Jewish communities</p> \n<p>Touma-Suleiman added that the committee will convene Wednesday to discuss an amendment to the law that would redefine felonies associated with domestic abuse. &quot;The murder of women is a gender crime. Women are murdered for being women and tomorrow we will ask for it to be determined that this crime should result in a life sentence, no less.&quot;</p> \n<p>The couple's neighbors said that they recently married and moved to the neighborhood three months ago. One neighbor called Awad&nbsp;a &quot;quiet and nice woman.&quot; According to her, Awad&nbsp;stopped working after she got married a second time, and had a young daughter who stayed with Iman's grandmother most of the time.</p> \n<p>Last week, tens of thousands of women went on strike and protested throughout Israel. Marches and demonstrations took place across the country, and protest displays were set up in central spots. The protests began at 10 A.M. on Tuesday with hundreds of people standing in silence for 24 minutes to commemorate the 24 women who had been murdered since the beginning of the year, before Awad's death.</p> \n<p>In the evening, 20,000 men and women participated at a protest at Tel Aviv's Rabin Square.

Earlier Tuesday, Italy's ministry of defense&nbsp;criticized Salvini&nbsp;for calling Hezbollah &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot; during his&nbsp;visit to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon.</p> \n<p>In a statement to Italian media, the Italian defense ministry said: “These statements obviously put in a very difficult position our men who are deployed on that southern border.”</p> \n<p>Italy is part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that serves as a peacekeeping force on the border between Israel and Lebanon, and currently heads the UN mission there.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Read more: Communist, separatist, nationalist: What you need to know about Italian strongman Matteo Salvini ■ Italy's Salvini: 'I don't have to justify myself every time I go to Israel'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In its statement, the Italian Ministry of Defense said Salvini’s comments caused “embarrassment” and undermined Italy’s “role as impartial brokers in the area.”</p> \n<p>Hezbollah’s armed wing is considered a terrorist organization by the European Union, but its political party is not.</p> \n<p>During a press conference at the King David hotel in Jerusalem, Salvini fired back at the ministry of defense, saying: “I don’t understand why they are so surprised I called Hezbollah Islamic terrorists.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think [Hezbollah] dug tunnels dozens of meters underground to go shopping,” he said.</p> \n<p>Salvini’s tour of the north, during the first day of his visit to Israel, comes as the Israeli army continues to unearth and dismantle a series of tunnels entering the country from Lebanon. UNIFIL confirmed the existence of a number of the tunnels found near the “blue line” frontier where Salvini toured. When the tunnels were first discovered UNIFIL described their existence as a “serious occurrence”.</p> \n<p>Calling Israel a “bulwark of Western rights and values,” Salvini said there is an “obvious risk of aggression by Islamic extremism” from Lebanon. “I thank Italian soldiers for their presence there but at my home we call terrorists by their name,” he said. “There are European court sentences that call terrorists terrorists,” he concluded.</p> \n<p>Asked by Haaretz whether he would move Italy’s embassy to Jerusalem, Salvini did not give a clear reply. “I will think about it when I am in a position to make such [a] decision, right now I am a minister of the interiors, not a foreign minister,” he said, without dismissing the idea.</p> \n<p>Salvini also called out the EU for its “unbalanced” position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying the organization “condemns Israel every 15 minutes.”</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately part of the aid given to Palestinians did not end up where it was supposed to,” Salvini added but did not provide further detail.</p> \n<p>Addressing criticism in Israel of his far-right positions, which saw a handful of people protest his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum, Salvini said the criticism just makes him “smile.” “They will get over it, it’s the fourth time I’ve come to Israel, fourth time I’ve gone to Yad Vashem,” he claimed.</p> \n<p>Asked about a purported anti-Semitic incident in Rome today, where stepping stones dedicated to the memory of Holocaust victims were vandalized, Salvini said he will do whatever is in his powers to catch those responsible. Asked about why he is not meeting any Palestinian representatives during his visit, he replied he will do so next time: “I sent my best wishes to Abu Mazen [Abbas], but if you look at my crazy schedule…”, he said, implying scheduling issues were the cause.</p> \n<p>Salvini also met with Israel's Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who urged him to make sure UNIFIL “be proactive” in dealing with Hezbollah and enforcing UN resolutions.</p> \n<p>Erdan said that in the future, Israel &quot;will have no choice but to strike Lebanon's infrastructure, which serves Hezbollah.&quot; Erdan also asked Salvini to work to “stop the EU from funding organizations that support a boycott,” a statement from the Israeli minister’s office said.</p> \n<p>Salvini said he was proud to be in Jerusalem &quot;the capital of Israel&quot; and called Israel &quot;a fortress for the protection of Europe.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Italian deputy premier added it must be recognized that a big part of today's anti-Semitic and anti-Israel sentiments come from &quot;the new Muslim communities [in Europe].&quot;</p> \n<p>Erdan thanked Salvini for his visit, and said Italy and Israel are &quot;partners in the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism that threatens Europe and Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>Erdan also thanked Salvini for Italy's &quot;efforts to preserve the memory of the Holocaust.”</p>",

Damari and eight others attacked Zarhum, mistakenly thinking he was the terrorist.</p> \n<p>Security camera footage showed Damari kicking Zarhum after he had been shot. The prosecution in the case had initially sought to have Damari tried for aggravated intentional infliction of personal injury, which if convicted, could have had him sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Damari is in a poor emotional state and has deteriorated while his case has been pending. Two months ago, he threatened a member of the prosecution team in his case, prompting additional charges against him and an order that he remain in detention until that case is disposed of.</p> \n<p>His lawyer, Moshe Sorogovich, had asked the court to limit his client's sentence to just over a month at most and cited the case of another of Zarhum's assailants at the bus station, David Moyal, who in July was sentenced in a plea agreement to 100 days of community service. Moyal had hit Zarhum with a bench.</p> \n<p>In addition to Damari and Moyal, two others were charged with assaulting Zarhum: A Golani brigade soldier by the name of Ya'akov Shamba and a prison service employee, Ronen Cohen.</p> \n<p>The cases against Shamba and Cohen are still pending. At the trial of Shamba's case last month, two former Israeli army major generals testified that under the circumstances, in the midst of a terrorist attack, Shamba had acted in a level-headed manner as would have been expected of a combat soldier.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The army’s activity on the Lebanese border, which was initially described with some disparagement as a defensive engineering operation of negligible importance, is now reaching a more sensitive stage. After several days of confusion, it is clear that the Lebanese government has begun to formulate a response to the Israeli move.</p> \n<p>Lebanese army patrols are now facing Israeli forces in those areas where Israel Defense Forces soldiers are digging near the border. In particular, the tension is rising – and with it the potential for a mistake that could develop into a confrontation – in those “enclaves” where the IDF is operating. These are areas north of the border fence over which Israel claims sovereignty according to a UN decision.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;UPDATE:&nbsp;Israel says it discovered third cross-border Hezbollah tunnel&nbsp;■&nbsp;Israel seeks to leverage op against Hezbollah tunnels to complete Lebanon border wall | Analysis</p> \n<p>In these areas there is no wall or fence separating the Israeli and Lebanese forces. In some places, the IDF has stretched barbed wire to mark the exact location of the border. But the images being published on the Lebanese side, for example, from the village of Meiss al-Jabel, tell the main story of the last few days; you can see Israeli soldiers in them, equipped with rifles and anti-tank missiles, while an Israeli bulldozer is working on the other side of the rock.</p> \n<p>When both sides are viewing each other from relatively close range, each equipped with weapons aimed at the other side of the border, as UNIFIL soldiers try to serve as a buffer between the Israelis and the Lebanese (with Hezbollah members presumably watching closely), it’s a recipe for a possible eruption. The IDF will have to manage the work with extreme precision and caution so as not to spark an unwanted incident. Everyone’s nerves are tense enough; all it would take is one antsy Lebanese soldier to spark a fire that will be hard to extinguish.</p> \n<p>A brief reminder: Israel withdrew in May 2000 from southern Lebanon and regrouped on the Blue Line, the international border recognized by the United Nations and drawn by its experts. But in some places along the border, the fence, for engineering reasons, was built south of the Blue Line, leaving enclaves under Israeli sovereignty north of it.</p> \n<p>After the Second Lebanon War in 2006, Israel insisted on maintaining a military presence in these enclaves by making periodic patrols. The Lebanese government recognizes the UN map in principle but holds reservations about 13 points along the border. The dispute between the two sides has intensified over the past year because Israel has begun to build a wall to prevent land infiltrations in two of these disputed areas, between Kibbutz Manara and Misgav Av, and east of Rosh Hanikra.</p> \n<p>There have been several incidents connected to Israeli activity in the enclaves. In 2007 there was an exchange of fire between an IDF force and a Lebanese army armored personnel carrier, when Israel insisted on establishing facts on the ground in one of the enclaves. In 2010 a reserve battalion commander, Lt. Col. Dov Harari, was killed by Lebanese soldiers when the IDF trimmed trees in an enclave near Kibbutz Manara.</p> \n<p>The Israeli operation to locate the tunnels is making everyone involved tense. All the players on the Lebanese side have something to hide. Hezbollah dug the tunnels, violating the cease-fire agreements; the Lebanese army, which receives extensive assistance from the United States and France, did not lift a finger to prevent Hezbollah’s activities (and its intelligence personnel sometimes actually help Hezbollah); and UNIFIL was mainly busy staying out of trouble.</p> \n<p>The tunnels being exposed have their origins in homes in Lebanese villages; Israel for years asked the UN to survey these sites but was rebuffed on the grounds that these are private courtyards and UNIFIL would need solid evidence in order to check them. To Israeli eyes, this all looks like a cover-up in which the Lebanese government and the United Nations are taking an active role, even if they did not have detailed intelligence about Hezbollah’s secret excavations. Along with Israel’s goal of denying Hezbollah these assets and to leverage the discovery in the diplomatic arena, seeds have been planted that are leading to a long-expected serious crisis of confidence between Israel and the United Nations.</p> \n<p>All this is taking place on the backdrop of the thunderous, prolonged silence of Hezbollah, which has not yet responded to Israel’s declarations. One could assume that the organization is preoccupied with finding out how its secrets fell into IDF hands and what exactly Israeli intelligence knows about the rest of its plans. If there is a direct confrontation along the border, it is more likely to take place between the IDF and the Lebanese army, as it has in the past. But in the longer term, locating and destroying the tunnels will require Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons to reexamine the deployment along the Israeli border.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For many years, Haifa residents have been protesting conduct of the polluting petrochemical industries in their area, the criminally excessive emissions from the Oil Refineries, the pillars of fire that burn with frightening intensity, the plan to triple the refineries’ area, the private fuel terminal that’s liable to destroy the future of tourism and aviation in the city – and the ammonia tank that was ostensibly moved, but still poses a threat. And they’re still waiting for action.</p> \n<p>Israel’s government has refused to listen. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has never tweeted a word to Haifa residents, despite their stubborn and growing protests. Reports of the illness and death rates among children and adults of all ages haven’t moved him. The fact is we haven’t heard anything from him. Not from him nor from any of the other politicians for whom Haifa’s Arabs is the only subject that will make them pay attention to the city.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>They are depicting these residents as a looming danger, as did Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan in November 2016 when Haifa went up in flames. The only thing that interested him was blaming the Arabs who allegedly started the fires – a claim that later turned out to be completely false.</p> \n<p>Anyone who has read the papers this week might think that the worst thing happening in Israel right now is Haifa Mayor Einat Kalisch Rotem’s appointment of Raja Zaatry, a member of the Hadash party, as a deputy mayor in the city. Zaatry is evidently the type of Arab with whom one doesn’t swap jokes over hummus and tahini. He’s never expressed any great desire to be drafted into the army and hasn’t beat his breast over the sin of being an Arab.</p> \n<p>He’s an opinionated man, and the opinions he voices may be unpleasant, even upsetting. But Raja Zaatry hasn’t caused harm or, heaven forbid, death to anyone in the city. He hasn’t damaged the health of Haifa residents or their children, he hasn’t caused cancer in babies, nor has he increased the rate of breast and lung cancer among women. He’s participated in demonstrations with unsympathetic messages, but he definitely hasn’t done anything that caused parents to bury their children and families to sit shivah for their loved ones, victims of the worst pollution in Israel.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who never misses an opportunity to paint Arab Israelis as the biggest threat we face, is the one who is actually speaking with Hamas in Gaza and thereby granting the organization legitimacy. He’s also the one who kept silent – not uttering so much as a word, much less actually doing something – in the face of the threats by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who once described that he would use the Oil Refineries and the ammonia tank as targets and thereby cause casualties on a scale Israel has never known before. Netanyahu heard and didn’t react.</p> \n<p>But he did raise an outcry over a municipal order to shut down polluting factories, even calling Carmel Olefins a vital industry that cannot be closed. Why is a company that serves the plastic industry so vital? Perhaps we need to look into who its owners are, and then we’ll understand.</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Arye Dery, who has suddenly decided to speak out about what’s happening in Haifa’s new city hall, is, as we know, a righteous man, pure as the driven snow. He is seeking to turn Haifa Bay and its polluting factories into an autonomous industrial zone, so that Haifa won’t be able to enact laws that would prevent air pollution and punish those that cause it.</p> \n<p>Haifa hasn’t interested Israel’s government for years. Granted, Netanyahu has gone to the Sammy Ofer Stadium to see soccer games, eaten shawarma at a Likud activist’s shop in the Horev Center mall and visited the submarines at Haifa’s naval base. His wife Sara, and lately also his son Yair, have paid “me and the Holocaust” visits to Haifa’s Hadar neighborhood. But neither the city of Haifa nor its residents interest them.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu should therefore restrict his current interest in our city even further. We, the residents of Haifa, will get along with Raja Zaatry even when he becomes deputy mayor in another two-and-a-half years.</p> \n<p>The prime minister would do better to harness his enthusiasm for the benefit of what should have been done long ago for Haifa: ending the frenetic development of the Oil Refineries and the petrochemical industries, which have made it the most polluted city in Israel, and getting rid of all its other polluting, dangerous industries. If those industries were ever hit by so much as a single missile launched by Nasrallah, in keeping with his promise, then the situation would truly become dire.</p> \n<p>Gila Livni Zamir is a community activist who lives in Haifa.</p>",

        "text":["<p>It’s no surprise that Benjamin Netanyahu joined the mission that Interior Minister Arye Dery took on: barring Raja Zaatry, leader of the Hadash party in the Haifa City Council, from serving as deputy mayor — a paid position. It’s only natural for the prime minister, who objects to Arab citizens exercising their right to vote and as a result warns against “Arabs going to the polls in droves,” to object to their daring to exercise their right to be elected.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu has always benefited electorally from inciting against Arabs, portraying them as a fifth column and as supporters of terrorism. This kind of incitement “pays off” for the right twice over: On one hand, it encourages people to vote for those who promise to fight this minority and maintain the country’s “Jewish character.” And on the other, it undermines the legitimacy of alliances with Arab parties, such as the one forged by former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Mayor of Haifa, don’t give in</p> \n<p>Zaatry has denounced Zionism, asserted that Hamas and Hezbollah aren’t terrorist organizations and declared their resistance to the occupation legitimate. Netanyahu said he asked Haifa Mayor Einat Kalisch Rotem to cancel the appointment of “a deputy mayor who supports Hezbollah and Hamas, which have declared their intention to destroy the State of Israel.” But even if Zaatry’s remarks are not music to Jewish Israeli ears, the attempt to reduce them into support for a battle to destroy Israel is demagogic and hypocritical.</p> \n<p>Zaatry is an Israeli Palestinian, and the two components of his identity are embroiled in a bloody conflict. His people has lived under Israeli military rule for more than 50 years, and not long ago, the country of which he is a citizen abandoned the principle of equality and enacted the nation-state law, which enshrines in law Jewish supremacy and Arab inferiority.</p> \n<p>Zaatry’s political views, however difficult they may be to hear, are legitimate. If his opponents had any legal basis for disqualifying his candidacy on account of them, they would have done so before he was elected.</p> \n<p>Labor Party Chairman Avi Gabbay and Meretz Chairwoman Tamar Zandberg both deserve praise for supporting Kalisch Rotem’s courageous refusal to give in to the pressure to cancel this appointment. The governing coalition she has formed ought to inspire the left’s leadership.</p> \n<p>“She faces a challenge that isn’t easy, of maintaining coexistence in the city,” Gabbay commented. And indeed, the future of the state, not to mention the political camp he seeks to lead, depends on the possibility of coexistence and of creating political alliances between Arabs and Jews.</p> \n<p>Arab citizens have the right to elect their own representatives. Zaatry was appointed democratically, as part of a coalition agreement, and there’s no legal justification for disqualifying him. He is expected to convene a press conference Wednesday, at which he will presumably offer to let Kalisch Rotem appoint Shahira Shalabi, No. 2 on the slate, as deputy mayor in his stead. This might be the smart solution, but it isn’t the just one.</p> \n<p>The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Tens of thousands of Israeli adults, including five percent of people 65 and over, use certain tranquilizers or sleeping pills too often, meaning at least once a day.</p> \n<p>The figure comes from a report, issued by the Health Ministry Tuesday, on public health in Israel. Among member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, only in Ireland and Portugal is there greater use of the class of drugs known as benzodiazepines.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>Prescribed for conditions including anxiety, insomnia, panic disorders and seizures, the group includes Valium, Clonex (Clonazepam, Klonopin), Lorivan (Lorazepam, Ativan), Bondormin (Brotizolam), Xanax, Vaben (Oxazepam, Serepax) and Ambien.</p> \n<p>Benzodiazepines work by slowing down the brain and the central nervous system, and are considered effective. But they are supposed to be used for a few weeks only, in order to avoid dependence and side effects that can include drowsiness, memory loss, loss of concentration and balance problems.</p> \n<p>Most of the people using these drugs are older women, because insomnia, anxiety and depression are all more common among postmenopausal women. According to the ministry’s report, the proportion of women over age 65 who overuse these drugs is 1.5 times higher than the proportion of men the same age — about six percent of women compared to only four percent of men.</p> \n<p>Additionally, overuse of these drugs is twice as common among well-off women as it is among poor women, and the dosage tends to rise with age.</p> \n<p>The report also found that postmenopausal women are often prescribed drugs whose prolonged use is bad for the elderly. About 2.5 percent of such women receive drugs defined as “long-lasting,” like Diazepam, Clorazepate and Nitrazepam. These slow-release drugs, when combined with elderly people’s slower metabolisms, lead to the drug accumulating in the body. They are therefore on the list of medications that the American Geriatrics Society doesn’t recommend for use by the elderly.</p> \n<p>“Many international organizations recommend avoiding use of these drugs in general, and especially long-term, given their negative effects — memory problems, instability, falls and more,” said Dr. Carmil Azran, a pharmacist who heads Herzliya Medical Center’s department of quality control, safety and infection prevention.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, she added, use of these drugs is widespread among the elderly. “We’ve seen a great many cases of patients who take one drug for anxiety during the day and another at night. Many of them haven’t heard about other techniques for improving sleep quality, of concepts like ‘sleep hygiene’ or drugs from other families, like melatonin.”</p> \n<p>Both in Israel and other Western countries, the fact that doctors prescribe anxiety and sleeping pills in large quantities has been widely criticized for years. Use of these drugs is very common in the West, and it is increasing due to rising life expectancies.</p> \n<p>A 2016 study by the Mayo Clinic in California found that more than 10 percent of American women aged 65 to 80 and six percent of men the same age filled at least one prescription for benzodiazepines over the course of a year. About a third of them received the drugs for more than 120 days a year.</p> \n<p>Another class of drugs that is widely overused is antibiotics, whose waning effectiveness as bacteria develop resistance is one of the most burning issues on today’s medical agenda. Unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which enable large groups of bacteria to develop resistance, has been one of the factors contributing to the spread of such bacteria.</p> \n<p>Compared to other OECD countries, Israel makes widespread use of two categories of broad-spectrum antibiotics, cyclosporines and quinolones, said Prof. Ronit Calderon-Margalit. She argued that a national plan is needed to reduce the use of antibiotics.</p> \n<p>Of all the antibiotics prescribed by community clinics, 22 percent are broad-spectrum, compared to an OECD average of 18 percent. And in most Western European countries, the rates are much lower — six percent in Sweden, four percent in Britain and three percent in Denmark.</p> \n<p>On another issue, the ministry’s report found that 62 percent of Israeli men aged 20 to 64 and 53 percent of women the same age are overweight or obese.</p> \n<p>But for the first time, it also showed a decline in the proportion of the population with diabetes, to 9.6 percent. In addition, it found that the proportion of diabetics whose situation has stabilized has risen sharply since 2013.</p> \n<p>On the down side, however, it found that the proportion of diabetics experiencing kidney failure — a complication that can necessitate dialysis treatment and can be fatal — is rising. There are currently some 600,000 people with diabetes in Israel and 600,000 more who are prediabetic.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Raja Zaatry, the newly appointed Haifa deputy mayor, is a dangerous man. So dangerous that Interior Minister Arye Dery seeks a way to legally block his appointment. Even the prime minister took the trouble to call Mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem and ask that she not appoint him, and now, as is his wont, he’ll try to cook up a law to this end. Culture Minister Miri Regev was quick to get in on the act too, of course.</p> \n<p>Zaatry is a bad Arab. Why can’t he be nice like Adham Jamal, the deputy mayor of Acre, who backed Mayor Shimon Lankri’s call for Einat Weizman’s play “Prisoners of the Occupation” to be banned from last year’s Acre festival? Why can’t he be nice like Faraj Ibn Faraj, the deputy mayor of Lod, who condemned the fireworks displays on Memorial Day this year, or like Shukri Awawdeh, the deputy mayor of Upper Nazareth, who though a communist has declared he’s here to serve everyone?</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;Raja Zaatry has a right to be deputy mayor of Haifa | Editorial&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Awawdeh, by the way, is a family doctor at one of Israel’s health maintenance organizations, one of those many Arab doctors in the country’s hospitals who have about half of Israel’s Jews concerned, according to a poll by the Guttman Institute, as reported on the television program London &amp; Kirschenbaum.</p> \n<p>Not that it’s surprising, but still it’s curious that the phones in the offices of Benjamin Netanyahu and Regev were apparently disconnected when Afula Mayor Avi Elkabetz introduced a racist loyalty oath for the new city council members, or when former Upper Nazareth Mayor Shimon Gapso, who was convicted of bribery, capped off his election campaign with the slogan “Upper Nazareth for Jews only.”</p> \n<p>None of our political leaders asked the interior minister to fire these folks for racist incitement or harming the “delicate fabric” of Jewish-Arab coexistence. Zaatry genuinely supports this delicate fabric, no quotation marks needed.</p> \n<p>The agreement that he and his party signed with the mayor doesn’t include any statements of support for Hamas or Hezbollah, but it does state that “both sides are committed to rebuffing all racist discourse and denouncing anyone who supports racist action against any group of residents, regardless of ethnicity, religion, race or gender, including against Arab residents.” It adds that the mayor “views the Arab residents as citizens with equal rights who make a special contribution to the city and its human capital, along with all Haifa residents from all parts of the population.”</p> \n<p>Herein lies the problem for the government’s proponents of racism. According to the agreement, the Jewish mayor must condemn all expressions of racism, even if comes from the Knesset or the prime minister’s residence. She’ll have to denounce her colleagues from Afula, Lod and Acre if they make statements against “the Arab race.”</p> \n<p>Kalisch-Rotem will be the armor that defends against the white-robed, masked and pointy-hooded torchbearers. To them, an insidious agreement has been signed by a fine daughter of Israel – Zaatry isn’t the real threat, but rather mayors like Kalisch-Rotem who open the city gates to the wreckers.</p> \n<p>In the view of the high priests of the nation-state, coexistence on the city level not only goes against the spirit of the times, it’s an attempt to subvert the country’s Jewish identity and grant a loyalty badge to citizens whom the state seeks to portray as traitors. These priests don’t recognize the concept of a “mixed city.” To them, Haifa, Acre, Upper Nazareth, Carmiel, Ramle and Lod are Jewish cities where, alas, Arabs live too.</p> \n<p>This situation goes against the nation-state law, which states that the state “views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation.” This section doesn’t refer solely to new communities to be built. It refers to existing ones as well. Yes, to Haifa too. And this hole in the dam must be plugged.</p>",

This week is the closing date for Poland’s “national recipe” competition declared by the&nbsp; Agriculture Ministry.</p> \n<p>The objective is pretty ambitious: to create a list of 100 “authentic” Polish dishes. The ministry’s website stresses the diplomatic aspect of “reviving Polish cuisine,” depicting it as a vital component of defining the Polish national identity and strengthening Poland’s image abroad.</p> \n<p>A committee comprised of chefs and food historians will review the recipes submitted from all over Poland and pick the winners. And Agriculture Minister Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski has promised that restaurants serving at least 10 of the 100 chosen dishes will be certified as serving authentic Polish food.</p> \n<p>But the competition lacked controversy, with the million-zloty question being: What exactly is Polish food?</p> \n<p>The minister anticipated these arguments and tried to calm things down in advance. In a special announcement, he offered assurances that the government wouldn’t deny the contribution of other nations to Polish national cuisine. “Jews, Germans, Russians, Ukrainians and Tatars have all left their mark on our menu, evidence of our ethnic richness,” he said.</p> \n<p>His words managed to irritate Meir Bulka, whose last name suspiciously resembles the Polish word for roll or bun. Bulka is a food photographer and founder of the organization J-nerations, which strives to preserve Jewish heritage in Poland.</p> \n<p>He says the Jewish contribution to Polish food is definitive and shouldn’t have been mentioned in tandem with the marginal contributions of other peoples.</p> \n<p>The preservation of so-called Polish foods happens every day in Israel, particularly in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, Bulka says, offering plenty of examples.</p> \n<p>“Their pierogi are basically the Jewish kreplach that we love so much,” he&nbsp; says.</p> \n<p>In Poland, Polish herring is called “Jewish-style fish,” while to this day matza-ball soup is considered a delicacy in Poland. “Even chicken soup ... is called Jewish penicillin in Poland,” Bulka says.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Zvi Kelner, director of the Israel-Poland Friendship Association, says he’s “crazy about authentic Polish food that isn’t necessarily Jewish.” Some examples are zurek (a soup), golonka (pork knuckle), kaszanka (blood sausage) and kotlet schabowy (breaded pork cutlet).</p> \n<p>Until the results are announced and “Polish dish” gets an official definition, you might consider the food for thought offered by one online kibitzer. Rather than looking for more reasons to eat, he suggested declaring a Polish national diet to mark the country’s 100th anniversary. “We’re getting fat,” he said.</p>",

The company produces brands including Arnold, Sara Lee, Stroehmann, Freihofer’s and others.</p> \n<p>Two of its major brands, Entenmann’s and Thomas, will remain certified kosher. So, kosher eaters, your crumb doughnuts and English muffins are still safe. A couple of rye breads also will retain their certifications.</p> \n<p>“Removing the kosher certification from some of our products was strictly a business-process decision to enable more efficient operations, and it was one we did not make lightly,” Bimbo said in a statement. “Thomas’ and Entenmann’s products as well as Arnold’s and Levy’s Rye Breads will remain kosher-certified. It is important to note that we have heard our consumers’ concerns and are working with kosher certification organizations and discussing alternative solutions.”</p> \n<p>The company did not say when the decision will take effect, and the kosher certification agencies do not know, though they assume it will be sometime next year.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Mixed marriages don’t necessarily create assimilation | Opinion</p> \n<p>The decision will make it much harder for those outside major Jewish population centers to buy kosher bread, say executives at the Orthodox Union and Kof-K, the kosher agencies that certify the vast majority of Bimbo’s kosher products in the U.S. Rabbi Ari Senter, Kof-K’s kosher administrator, said the agency has received hundreds of concerned calls since the decision was first reported earlier this month.</p> \n<p>“We’ve been hearing from a lot of consumers that they’re concerned about this,” said Rabbi Menachem Genack, the rabbinic administrator of the Orthodox Union's kosher division, the largest in the country. “If you live throughout the United States, it’s not always so easy to get kosher bread. In terms of kosher bread, Bimbo plays a critical role.”</p> \n<p>Genack explained that the decision stems from a mix of corporate efficiency and obscure kosher laws: Bimbo wants the flexibility to produce its breads on the same factory lines as breads that contain dairy products. Because traditional Jewish law says meat and dairy products cannot be consumed at the same meal, breads for the kosher market must be strictly nondairy unless they appear and are marketed as obviously dairy — like cheese bread, says Senter.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;What's the only country in the world where men claim they're more religious than women? | Opinion</p> \n<p>“Their primary concern is one of flexibility within their plants, that they can produce it on other lines that are not necessarily designated for kosher,” Genack said.</p> \n<p>Both agencies are in ongoing conversation with Bimbo hoping to salvage some more kosher brands and clarify when the changes will take effect. Until then, most breads remain kosher certified.</p> \n<p>Bimbo Bakeries USA is the U.S. division of Grupo Bimbo, the Mexican company that is the world’s largest bakery. The company, whose name is pronounced “Beem-bo” and is derived from the Italian word “bambino,” capped an aggressive move into the U.S. market with its 2011 acquisition of the Sara Lee Corp.</p> \n<p>According to KosherFest, a large trade show of kosher foods, there are 1.3 million year-round Jewish consumers of kosher foods in the United States and 35 million non-Jewish consumers of kosher products. According to the Mintel market research firm, more than 40 percent of new foods launched in 2014 claimed to be kosher.</p>",

If it passes the House of Representatives, it would go to the White House for Trump to sign or veto.</p> \n<p>Corker said he hoped to introduce the legislation as soon as Tuesday, but a spokeswoman said later it would not be before Wednesday. “Hopefully, we’ll have a very, very strong vote on a resolution condemning the crown prince,” Corker said.</p> \n<p>Aides to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the House planned to vote on the measure if it passed the Senate.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Trump's decision to stand by Saudi prince has Netanyahu's fingerprints on it | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Separately, a House aide said that CIA Director Gina Haspel would hold a classified briefing on the Khashoggi case for House leaders and the heads of national security committees on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Two Democratic senators, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley, said they sent a letter on Tuesday asking Energy Secretary Rick Perry to brief Congress on any talks he had with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear agreement on a recent trip to the kingdom.</p> \n<p>Department of Energy officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Joint congressional resolutions must be signed by the president and have the force of law. The resolution’s content has not been released, so it was not clear whether the joint resolution would prompt any specific punishment against the crown prince or the kingdom beyond a statement of condemnation.</p> \n<p>Corker said it was largely similar to a resolution introduced last week by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and other Republicans and Democrats that condemned Khashoggi’s death and said the Senate “has a high level of confidence” that the Saudi crown prince was complicit in his murder.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nick Cave, the Australian rock musician, released an email he sent to fellow musician Brian Eno regarding the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel, calling the boycott &quot;cowardly and shameful.&quot;</p> \n<p>Cave, who played two concerts in Tel Aviv in November 2017, wrote that the BDS movement is part of the reason he chose to play in Israel, &quot;not as support for any particular political entity but as a principled stand against those who wish to bully, shame and silence musicians.”&nbsp; He added that the boycott, “risks further entrenching positions in Israel in opposition to those you support.”</p> \n<p>Cave wrote that engaging with the Israeli population could have a much greater effect than a boycott. He wrote that he realized it would make a more powerful statement &quot;to go to Israel and tell the press and the Israeli people how you feel about their current regime, then do a concert on the understanding that the purpose of your music was to speak to the Israeli people’s better angels.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The day the music died: Will BDS bring Tel Aviv's club scene to a standstill?</p> \n<p>Following Cave's decision to play in Israel last year, Eno wrote, as part of a group statement released by Artists for Palestine, &quot;Israel has consistently used cultural exchange as a form of ‘hasbara’ (propaganda) to improve the image of the country abroad. The BDS campaign is simply asking artists not to be part of that propaganda campaign.&quot;</p> \n<p>“I do not support the current government in Israel, yet do not accept that my decision to play in the country is any kind of tacit support for that government’s policies,” Cave said, adding that he supported the Palestinian cause and that Palestinian suffering “is ended via a comprehensive and just solution, one that involves enormous political will on both sides”.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cave cited his own charity work, raising over &pound;150,000 for Palestinian children through the Hoping Foundation, which stands for hope and optimism for Palestinians in the next generation.</p> \n<p>Cave added a note that accompanied the publishing of his letter, praising Eno's music and influence, &quot;If there seems to be a thread of anguish that runs through this letter, this is indeed the case. I am writing to my hero.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, Cave went on to explain that this does not justify the &quot;weaponizing&quot; of music or using music to &quot;punish ordinary Israeli citizens for the actions of their government.&quot; He added: &quot;I simply could not treat my Israeli fans with the necessary contempt to do Brian Eno’s bidding.”</p> \n<p>Cave explained that, several years ago, he understood that he wouldn't sign an &quot;Artists for Palestine&quot; petition, calling for artists to refrain from coming to Israel. &quot;I didn't want to sign the petition. I didn't connect to it. I don't like lists,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Cave said he realized that though he wouldn't sign the petition, he also hadn't performed in Israel for 20 years. Cave first visited Israel to play a concert in 1993, and has returned three times since.</p> \n<p>Other musicians who share Cave's stance include Radiohead's Thom Yorke. Yorke defended his own decision to play in Israel, writing, &quot;Playing in a country is not the same as endorsing its government.&quot;</p> \n<p>A growing list of musicians have cancelled their concerts in Israel in recent years. Lana Del Rey cancelled her planned performance at the Meteor Festival in September, citing an inability to set up a corresponding show for Palestinian fans on such short notice. Pop singer Lorde also cancelled a show slated for June 2018, citing the BDS movement.</p>",

        "text":["<p>As long as there’s no women’s party in the Knesset, there’s no reason to expect female legislators to put women’s issues ahead of their party’s interests – certainly not when the governing coalition has a razor-thin majority. This is one explanation for the disgraceful role of Likud MK Nava Boker in the honoring of singer Eyal Golan by the Knesset Caucus for the Promotion of Israeli Music, which Boker heads. Golan was once accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls.</p> \n<p>Boker’s comments on this matter show that she knows that to keep her Knesset seat she needs the support of party members, not women. In fact, she openly admits this. Thus expectations should be better aligned with reality: Female MKs are party members first, and only afterward, if at all, on the side of women in general.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The unrealistic expectations were one reason for some of the anger and disappointment directed at female MKs who voted against establishing an inquiry committee on the murder of women in Israel. Journalist Oshrat Kotler said it was a “black mark for the women ministers and MKs” and called them a “symbol of disgrace” (on the Channel 10 program “The Magazine”). Actress Gila Almagor expressed similar sentiments in an interview with Kan Bet radio. Kotler and Almagor are right, but history shows that if some of the female coalition MKs had voted in favor, it would have been pretty surprising.</p> \n<p>Aside from WIZO’s one seat in the First Knesset (1949-1951), all female MKs have served as a minority for parties controlled by men. The percentage of women in the Knesset has risen in the last generation, and with the exception of the ultra-Orthodox parties, more women have had high slots on party tickets, and have also headed tickets. But just as was the case two and three generations ago, female MKs’ loyalty goes to their parties first.</p> \n<p>In the state’s early years too, women expected female MKs to show solidarity with other women. Around the time of the 1961 elections, female journalists met with six of the 10 female MKs at the time. They asked them to name the most urgent problems for Israeli women and the bills helping women they planned to submit. Haaretz’s Shulamit Lavari, who led the meeting, asked the MKs if they thought they had done enough in their parliamentary work for women.</p> \n<p>The answers reflected each MK’s connection with the coalition and her party’s ideology. Baba Idelson of Mapai, then the largest party in the Knesset, said she thought women’s status was fine and there were no laws on the books that discriminated against women. Emma Levine-Talmi of Mapam, a party even further to the left, replied candidly: “We worked quite a bit, we achieved quite little.”</p> \n<p>In response to questions about the high cost of living and the difficulty of managing a household budget, the MKs on the right spoke of the need to reduce government involvement on the issue, while left-wing MKs supported tighter government supervision, and Idelson defended the existing policy.</p> \n<p>Generally, female MKs from opposition parties were more critical of government policy toward women, but not necessarily because their parties promoted women’s issues or declared the advancement of women part of their agenda. Rather, it was because in such cases, promoting the party’s interests didn’t always conflict with promoting women’s interests. In this way they also showed that party interests invariably take precedence.</p> \n<p>The female journalist had expected that the female MKs, just because they were women, would work to promote women’s status and solve problems faced by women, both on the individual and public level. Yehudit Winkler of Herut magazine remarked that “for a moment one could get caught up in the sweet illusion that, despite the sharp disagreements between the various parties, the women still find a common language.” But it didn’t happen.</p> \n<p>A similar thing happened with the female journalists themselves. Most worked for newspapers with a clear affinity for a certain party or movement that had Knesset representation – Davar was the main Mapai paper and Herut was the Herut party’s magazine. And while Haaretz portrayed itself as beholden solely to its readers, it too had a similar connection: Publisher and editor Gershom Schocken was an MK for the Progressive Party in the second half of the ‘50s.</p> \n<p>In any case, the expectation of a long-term uniting of forces among all women in Israel didn’t stand the test of reality – thanks to female voters. While the First Knesset included WIZO, it didn’t represent all Israeli women but rather two large women’s organizations. WIZO soon chose to work outside parliament. In the ‘70s, a women’s party that ran for the Knesset didn’t win enough votes to pass the threshold.</p> \n<p>For now it seems impossible that a party that officially represents all women will be established and make it into the Knesset. Therefore the expectation of female solidarity should be replaced by an emphatic call for female MKs to work on behalf of women, each within her own party. Female MKs are party members first, but the question is what they do in their party.</p> \n<p>Dr. Sharon Geva teaches at the Kibbutz Seminar and at Tel Aviv University.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Just one week after an inspiring protest against domestic violence swept the country, culminating in a demonstration attended by 30,000 people, another woman had her throat slit in her own home.</p> \n<p>This year has been especially deadly for Israeli women. The number of murdered women keeps rising, yet the Knesset’s response has been shameful. On the very day when a female Knesset member, Nava Boker, demonstrated her scorn for the status of women — and especially that of vulnerable girls — by giving an award to singer Eyal Golan, a 29-year-old woman from Acre, Iman Ahmed Awad, was murdered.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli army operation couldn't hold back outrage over government inaction on violence against women&nbsp;■&nbsp;After the national protest against femicide, women in Israel can dream&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Arab voices raised as local Israeli authorities join nation-wide women's strike to protest violence&nbsp;■ Israeli women took to the street. But where were all the men? | Analysis&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Domestic violence and femicide have always been marginal issues in Israel’s public conversation; they have been neglected for years. Pictures of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara visiting a shelter for battered women and expressing sympathy for victims of domestic violence aren’t enough. Netanyahu’s media show, including his announcement that he would form and chair a ministerial committee to fight domestic violence, are nothing more than lip service, at least for now.</p> \n<p>This murder could have been prevented. So we should ask the government, what did you do to prevent it?</p> \n<p>About half of all Israeli women who were murdered over the past decade were Arab, as were around half of the female survivors of murder attempts. Fascist nationalists have recently been exploiting this grim statistic to intensify racism, shirk responsibility for the issue and downplay its dimensions. But above all, this fact is evidence of long-standing institutional racism — the state’s neglect of Arab women who suffer from domestic violence.</p> \n<p>Over the past decade, there has been a notable rise in the number of police complaints filed by Arab women. But this merely makes the police’s negligence more obvious.</p> \n<p>The police have too few Arabic-speaking investigators, and especially female ones; they tend to downplay the danger that complainants face; they don’t enforce restraining orders and too many murders go unsolved. All this sends the message that the police are only there for Jewish women; they aren’t responsible for Arab women’s safety.</p> \n<p>On top of all this, the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs and Social Services has discriminated against Arab women for years when it comes to the allocation of funds. There are only two shelters for Arab women — and none at all for Bedouin women — compared to 14 for Jewish women. There’s also a lack of alternatives for Arab women for whom shelters are inappropriate, such as women at high, prolonged risk, who can’t remain in shelters forever.</p> \n<p>In addition, there’s a shortage of Arabic-speaking social workers, so the help given to both the victims and the perpetrators of domestic violence is often linguistically and culturally inappropriate.</p> \n<p>According to a 2017 report by the Knesset Research and Information Center, about half of the Arab women who were murdered were known to local welfare agencies — a fact that underscores their abject failure to address the problem.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it’s important to remember that the women who have been murdered this year also included immigrants from the former Soviet Union, African asylum seekers and native-born Israeli Jews.</p> \n<p>Ending violence against women is a cornerstone of the battle for equality and social justice. First and foremost, the government must immediately implement an already approved plan to combat this problem. And until the necessary funding is approved, we should support the call for women to strike for 25 minutes every day.</p>",

The mayor replied that she has no intention to break coalition agreements.</p> \n<p>“This morning I was looking for Haifa&nbsp;Mayor Einat Kalisch [sic] because I wanted to ask her to cancel the appointment of a deputy mayor who supports Hezbollah and Hamas, [organizations that] declare that their goal is destroying Israel,” Netanyahu told ministers at the beginning of the cabinet meeting.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Pilot, poet, scuba diver, lefty – the non-Orthodox rabbi bringing unorthodox views to city hall ■ Analysis:&nbsp;For once, Israel's local elections matter to Netanyahu</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's request came after Interior Minister Arye Dery tweeted&nbsp;on Friday that he would find out whether he could legally block Zaatry's appointment.</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;&quot;has expressed support for Hezbollah and Hamas, has supported boycotts of Israel and action against Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Such a person cannot be named as a deputy mayor, as Haifa’s mayor seeks to do,” Dery tweeted.</p> \n<p>Dery asked his ministry’s legal adviser, Yehuda Zemrat, to look into the matter, and was informed that Zaatry&nbsp;denied some of the claims against him. Dery then asked his ministry’s director general, Mordechai Cohen, to launch a thorough investigation and requested Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit to decide whether the interior minister has the authority to block Zaatry's salary if he is appointed deputy mayor.</p> \n<p>“I’m glad our colleague Arye Dery has already begun to deal with it and I know that many others have expressed themselves as well on this topic. This is inconceivable and therefore will not happen, I’m sure of it,” Netanyahu said on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;told Haaretz that he intends to work for the residents of Haifa, a mixed Jewish-Arab city, and that he is a member of a party that strongly supports peace and solidarity.</p> \n<p>“I was democratically and legally elected to the Haifa City Council. I will represent the people of the city, Arabs and Jews, for a dignified life, real partnership, social and distributive justice and integrity. I am obligated only to the people who elected me and they are the ones who will judge my actions. I intend to represent them and work for them, with or without pay, with or without the seal of approval of that knight of good governance, Arye Dery, or from Yair Lapid and those sitting in the back rows of Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu. I am a member neither of Hamas nor of Hezbollah, but rather of the Israeli Communist Party and the Hadash movement, which holds high the banner of peace, equality and fraternity among nations,” Zaatry said.</p> \n<p>He added: “Netanyahu and his corrupt government are trying to divert public opinion away from the real danger to the people in Israel, which is not in the Haifa municipality, but on 10 Balfour Street in Jerusalem” referring to Netanyahu’s official residence. “When I become deputy mayor, Netanyahu and Dery will probably already be in jail,” he said.</p> \n<p>In response to Netanyahu's remarks, MK Yousef Jabareen (Joint List) tweeted: &quot;Netanyahu's lame intervention against Raja Zaatry&nbsp;is part of a violent, racist campaign waged by the radical right, reminiscent of the dark incitement against minorities in twentieth century Europe. Haifa's Arab residents deserve meaningful representation. Leave Haifa alone, a city that promotes a shared society as an alternative to Netanyahu's policy of hatred and incitement.&quot;</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;was elected in October’s local elections as a member of the Haifa Front, a party linked to Hadash. According to the coalition agreement he is to serve as a deputy mayor during the second half of the new mayor’s term. Rabbi Dov Haiyun (Meretz) is to serve in the first half of the term.</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;has been a political activist for years and made a number of controversial remarks in the past. In 2015, as Joint List campaign leader, he said Hamas is not a terrorist organization and that Islamic State draws inspiration from Zionism. “Where did they learn these crimes from? Look at what the Zionist movement did in 1948 – rape, plunder, and murder.” He has also expressed support in the past for Syria’s President Bashar Assad and for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.</p> \n<p>The protests against his appointment began on a Haifa residents’ Facebook page; another page has been opened on the same issue at the initiative of the right-wing group Im Tirtzu. Right-wing lawmakers have also spoken out against his appointment. Likud MK Yoav Kish asked Dery to intervene, writing to him that “in recent days details of his (Zaatry’s) support for the terrorist organization Hamas have been published... Today there is no possibility under the law to prevent a mayor from naming such a person as deputy mayor but the minister should have the authority to do so.”</p> \n<p>Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid has also come out against Zaatry’s appointment. He called on the Zionist Union, Kalisch Rotem's party, to call on her to cancel the agreement “that links them to the worst of Israel’s haters.”</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;told Haaretz that Likud and Shas were left out of the city’s coalition and were now competing over which could be more right wing.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Kalisch Rotem posted on her Facebook page: “Haifa is a mixed, complex, multifaceted, city. The secret of its beauty is precisely that, in its extraordinary human mosaic. When I signed an agreement with [ultra-Orthodox] Degel HaTorah before the elections, secular voters accused me of turning Haifa into [ultra-Orthodox city] Bnei Brak. When I signed an agreement with Yisrael Beiteinu, I was cautioned by the left that Haifa would lose its image as a moderate city and thus be harmed... Today we have signed an agreement with the Hadash party,” she said, adding that “the Arab public is an important part of our city.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Jerusalem’s local planning and building committee refused to discuss a building permit for expanding the mixed-gender prayer area in the Western Wall, saying it is “a highly sensitive site.”</p> \n<p>The mixed prayer area is meant to resolve a dispute with Jewish diaspora and non-Orthodox Jews to allow men and women to pray together and not under ultra-Orthodox rules at Judaism’s second holiest site.</p> \n<p>In a letter sent last week by Jerusalem municipality director-general Amnon Merhav to Cabinet Secretary Tzachi Braverman, Merhav said that the local committee would not discuss the permit request. The district planning body, which answers to the government, will debate the permit on Monday instead. The district planning committee’s members include representatives from the government, the Jerusalem municipality, adjacent local municipalities and representatives from environmental organizations.</p> \n<p>The mixed prayer site was part of the Western Wall plan meant to resolve the problem of prayer freedom for non-Orthodox Jews but is vehemently opposed by the ultra-Orthodox as well as right-wing organizations such as Ateret Cohanim.</p> \n<p>In June 2017, because of pressure from the ultra-Orthodox parties, the cabinet retreated from its decision to provide an egalitarian prayer space at the Western Wall, which the cabinet had approved in January 2016.</p> \n<p>The prayer site’s construction was never completed and some of what was built violates its building permit. Now the government company charged with developing the Jewish Quarter in Jerusalem’s Old City asked the municipality to extend the building permit, but in an exceptional move the planning and building panel won’t even debate it.</p> \n<p>“Construction at the site was accompanied by deep and difficult disputes - planning, theological, national and international ones,” Merhav wrote. “In such a sensitive place and regarding such a sensitive issue, rife with disagreements and complexities, it would only be proper that the body dealing with requests for issuing and extending building permits should be a national planning body and not a local one,” Merhav wrote in his letter.</p> \n<p>The commission will be acting under Clause 28 of the Planning and Building Law, which allows the district planning commission to assume the authority of the local planning committee. According to a source familiar with the issue, during the past 40 years there have only been a handful of instances where a district planning committee used this clause to take authority usually vested with a local committee.</p> \n<p>The prayer space at the Western Wall was erected four years ago under Robinson’s Arch, an archaeological park situated at the southern end of the Wall, in order to serve non-Orthodox streams and allow mixed-gender prayer services. The Western Wall falls under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate, therefore ultra-Orthodox rules are maintained. This means separating men and women with a high fence and forbidding women to pray in loud voices with accessories restricted to men in Orthodox Judaism, such as skullcaps, prayer shawls and a Torah scroll.</p>",

        "text":["<p>U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, reportedly advised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on how to best survive the mounting scandal surrounding the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>The New York Times reported Saturday that Kushner and the crown prince continued to chat informally after Khashoggi’s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, despite formal White House procedures for contacts with foreign leaders. The New York Times reviewed emails and text messages between the crown prince and Kushner.</p> \n<p>Kushner went on Fox New's &quot;Hannity&quot; on Monday night to clear the air and vowed the U.S. would&nbsp;“get to the bottom” of who was responsible for Khashoggi’s murder. Both Sean Hannity and Kushner failed to mention the evidence or the CIA report that the crown prince had a role in the killing, but Kushner insisted&nbsp;“we’re hoping to make sure that there’s justice brought where that should be.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Kushner kept in line with Trump who has refused to implicate the crown prince in the murder despite the CIA and the U.S. Senate, including key Republican allies, saying so. Kushner simply stated that U.S. intelligence agencies are still investigating.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis: Trump's decision to stand by Saudi prince has Netanyahu's&nbsp;fingerprints on it</p> \n<p>According to the New York Times, one Saudi told the paper that Kushner gave “advice about how to weather the storm, urging him to resolve his conflicts around the region and avoid further embarrassments.”</p> \n<p>The report also details how a delegation of Saudis identified Kushner as “a crucial focal point in the courtship of the new administration” early on in Trump’s presidency. The delegation reported to the crown prince that Kushner “brought to the job scant knowledge about the region, a transactional mind-set and an intense focus on reaching a deal with the Palestinians that met Israel’s demands.”</p> \n<p>U.S. senators are considering multiple pieces of legislation to formally rebuke Saudi Arabia for the slaying of Khashoggi, with momentum building for a resolution to call the Saudi crown prince complicit in the killing.</p> \n<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said Thursday that senators are looking at moving three measures — a resolution to condemn the crown prince for Khashoggi’s murder, a bill to suspend arms sales to the kingdom and a resolution to call on President Donald Trump’s administration to pull back U.S. help for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.</p> \n<p>“We have three different efforts underway, all of which have a lot of momentum,” Corker, R-Tenn., said after meeting with other senators to negotiate on Thursday. Corker said that most senators “in some form or fashion are going to want to speak to Saudi Arabia and where they are and send a message.”</p> \n<p>It’s unclear how strong that message will be. The Senate is expected to vote next week on the Yemen resolution, but senators are wrestling with how to limit amendments to prevent a freewheeling floor debate that would allow votes on unrelated issues. Corker said the Foreign Relations panel may vote on the other two measures related to Saudi Arabia, but it’s unclear if there will be enough time — or willingness from leadership — to hold a Senate floor vote.</p> \n<p>Republican House leaders haven’t indicated they will take up any of the measures, meaning any action by the Senate is likely to be symbolic, for now. Democrats taking over the House in January have introduced bills similar to the Senate legislation and would be more likely to rebuke Saudi Arabia. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the chamber will have a briefing from intelligence officials next week on Khashoggi and “we’ll know more after that.”</p> \n<p>Senators in both parties have been enraged over the killing and over Trump’s equivocating on who is to blame. Pressed on a response to Saudi Arabia, the president has said the United States “intends to remain a steadfast partner” of the country, touted Saudi arms deals worth billions of dollars to the U.S. and thanked the country for plunging oil prices.</p> \n<p>Senators from both parties emerged from a CIA briefing earlier this week saying there was “zero chance” that the crown prince wasn’t involved in Khashoggi’s death. Their frustration with Trump’s response has fueled interest in the Yemen resolution, with 63 senators voting last week to move forward on it.</p> \n<p>Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who sponsored the resolution with Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, said he is “confident that we have the bipartisan votes to pass” the bill when the Senate is expected to take it up next week. But senators will also have to figure out how to avert dozens of amendments that could be allowed under the special rules of a resolution dealing with U.S. involvement in a war. If any of the amendments passed, the resolution’s passage could be jeopardized. Negotiations on how to proceed are underway, according to several senators.</p> \n<p>Corker also predicted the Yemen resolution will pass, but he wouldn’t say whether he would vote for it and suggested it wouldn’t be forceful enough as a rebuke.</p> \n<p>“In my opinion, I’d like to do something that actually has teeth,” Corker said.</p> \n<p>Corker said he is supporting the legislation by Sens. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and Todd Young, R-Ind., that would suspend weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and impose sanctions on people blocking humanitarian access in Yemen, among other actions. Human rights groups say the war is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate bombing.</p> \n<p>Corker said he has suggested some changes to the legislation to Menendez, who is the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel.</p> \n<p>Lastly, senators are considering a resolution condemning the crown prince over Khashoggi’s death. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., introduced a resolution Wednesday that would call bin Salman “complicit” in the slaying. Corker said he is negotiating with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to move that resolution or one that is similar.</p> \n<p>Khashoggi was killed two months ago. The journalist, who had lived in the U.S. and wrote for The Washington Post, had been critical of the Saudi regime. He was killed in what U.S. officials have described as an elaborate plot as he visited the consulate for marriage paperwork.</p> \n<p>U.S. intelligence officials have concluded that the crown prince must have at least known of the plot, but Trump has been reluctant to pin the blame.</p> \n<p>“It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event,” Trump said in a lengthy statement Nov. 20. “Maybe he did and maybe he didn’t!”</p> \n<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report</p>",

        "text":["<p>In a few weeks, Israel’s decision to withdraw as a member of UNESCO will take effect. The withdrawal from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization comes a year after Israel followed the lead of the United States, which announced it was quitting the organization due to “continuing anti-Israel bias” and &quot;concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO.&quot;</p> \n<p>People who understand the value and importance of membership in the United Nations agency, one of the most important organizations in the world, are expressing doubts over the wisdom of leaving it, citing possible harmful ramifications and declaring that the loss will be entirely Israel’s.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>When Israel officially announced its decision a year ago, many people viewed it as necessary, particularly in light of the U.S. move to leave and the series of anti-Israeli resolutions by UNESCO that preceded it, but now the decision seems to be divorced from reality. Since then, UNESCO hasn’t passed any other anti-Israeli resolutions and in any event the move to withdraw membership is taking place without any fanfare.</p> \n<p>The Education Ministry, which is responsible for dealing with UNESCO, confirmed to Haaretz this week that, “on January 11, 2019, Israel will halt its ties with the organization and all of its units, with the exception of particular instances requiring technical contacts alone with respect to [heritage] sites that [UNESCO] has already declared in Israel.”</p> \n<p>The move will not affect the man-made or natural landmarks in Israel that have already been recognized by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, due to their historical or cultural significance, but there will be no new cooperation between Israel and the UN organization, the ministry said.</p> \n<p>Heritage sites are members of an exclusive club, according them international prestige as well as ongoing preservation, and making them a drawing card for tourism. Research has shown than inclusion on the list boosts revenues at the sites by an average of 30 percent.</p> \n<p>The Education Ministry’s response suggests that Israel is not relinquishing the branding and prestige of landmarks that have been designated heritage sites around the country, and the UNESCO symbol will continue to be displayed at these tourism attractions. However, Israel is forgoing future relations with the Paris-based international organization and its huge range of activities in many realms.</p> \n<p>For his part, Daniel Bar-Eli, who until early 2012 was secretary general of the Israel National Commission for UNESCO, laments Israel's decision to quit the international organization.</p> \n<p>“We built an important relationship over many years. We sat on various UNESCO committees and influenced the debates and the resolutions. The subjects have been varied – education, marine studies, World Heritage Sites, music, language research,” Bar-Eli told Haaretz, who also cited the Yad Vashem Holocaust authority and the Israel Folktale Archives, both designated by UNESCO as part of its Memory of the World Register.</p> \n<p>Membership in UNESCO has showed Israel what it means to be part of the family of nations – “and now we are giving it up at our own initiative. If you’re not there, you have no voice,” added Bar-Eli. Quoting from the Book of Isaiah, he said withdrawal from the organization means one can no longer say: “For out of Zion shall go forth the law.”</p> \n<p>The United States already left UNESCO once before and was allowed to rejoin in 2005, Bar-Eli pointed out, and if the Americans sought to resume their membership again, they would probably succeed. But Israel’s standing as a small country with limited influence means that its status is different from that of a world power, and it’s not at all certain that Israel would be allowed to rejoin UNESCO should it so desire.</p> \n<p>Israel’s decision to leave the organization was based on emotions, not clear thinking, Bar-Eli said. He acknowledged that since the 1990s, UNESCO has adopted resolutions reflecting the growing influence of Arab and Muslim countries, including decisions critical of Israel's policies regarding Jerusalem's Old City, and the state of education and culture in the West Bank and Golan Heights, and the resolution admitting Palestine as a member of the organization.</p> \n<p>However, despite the prominent role the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has played in Israel’s relationship with UNESCO, Bar-Eli said, “We have managed to put it aside and to promote scientific, cultural and professional understandings without political resolutions.”</p> \n<p>Ironically, announcement of Israel’s withdrawal from UNESCO coincided with the appointment late last year of Audrey Azoulay, 46-year-old French-Jewish woman and former culture minister of France, as the organization’s director general. Her father, who was a senior adviser to the king of Morocco, was one of the intermediaries who helped forge peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors.</p> \n<p>When Azoulay took the helm of UNESCO, she asked for a period of grace to address certain issues affecting the organization. As Bar-Eli sees it, she has taken a number of important steps but they are not sufficient. He asked the Israeli Foreign Ministry to invite her to Israel, but no one took up the suggestion.</p> \n<p>To date, nine sites in Israel have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Masada; the Old City of Acre; Tel Aviv’s White City; the biblical archaeological mounds (tels) at Megiddo, Hatzor and Be’er Sheva; the Beit Guvrin caves; Beit She'arim; the Negev Incense Route; the Baha’i holy places in Haifa and Acre; and the Nahal Me’arot prehistoric caves on the Carmel Mountain. The Old City of Jerusalem received the designation while it was still under Jordanian control. Over a dozen other sites in the country have been suggested as nominees for the special UNESCO status.</p> \n<p>Three World Heritage Sites are located within the territory of the Palestine Authority: the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, the Battir agricultural terraces on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem and Hebron’s Old City in the West Bank.</p>",

The three officials also asked not to be identified.</p> \n<p>Trump also claimed during the meeting that, “If you really want to find out how effective a wall is, just ask Israel.” JTA's Ron Kampeas points out though, &quot;It’s not clear which wall Trump is referring to; Israel credits a wall and fence running through the West bank with stopping terrorist attacks.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, Kampeas explains, &quot;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has&nbsp;cited&nbsp;another wall, along Israel’s southern border with Egypt, as a model for the United States in its bid to stop migrants from crossing without approval.

        "text":["<p>The Israeli government will attempt to secure the release of two Palestinian residents of Israel who were arrested in the West Bank city of Ramallah by the Palestinian Authority, the Knesset’s Interior and Environment Committee was told on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the National Security Council to coordinate policy in the wake of the arrest of the two: Issam Akel, a Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem who also holds American citizenship, and another Palestinian identified as Nasser-a-Din.</p> \n<p>The National Security Council is looking into ways to increase the pressure on the PA.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Palestinians - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The Palestinian Authority arrested&nbsp;Akel in October. He&nbsp;has been held in Palestinian detention ever since on suspicion of involvement in the sale of a home in Jerusalem’s Old City to a right-wing Jewish organization. Nasser-a-Din, also a East Jeusalem resident, has been held in detention for eight months under suspicion of his involvement in a murder.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The National Security Council’s involvement in the issue was disclosed at the Knesset committee session by the head of council’s internal policy division, Amit Aviram. Aviram said that the Council has been dealing with this over the past week &quot;on a regular basis&quot; and have held a discussion on the topic that included representatives from all security bodies. Another discussion is expected Thursday.</p> \n<p>Aviram, however, declined to say what action Israel would take over what he called the PA's refusal to release the pair. &quot;We are dealing with the PA, which is currently holding the two detainees and won't release them,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The two cases come against the backdrop of the competing claims that Israel and the PA have over the Old City and the rest of East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 Six-Day War and which the PA claims as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The issue of land sales to Jews in East Jerusalem is therefore particularly sensitive to both sides.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Palestinian Authority and hamas systematically torture detainees, report finds</p> \n<p>Following Akel’s detention by the PA, Israeli police arrested several Palestinian suspects for involvement in the Palestinian-American’s detention, including the PA's Jerusalem governor, Adnan Ghaith, as well as Jihad Al-Faqeeh, chief of intelligence for the PA in the Jerusalem area.</p> \n<p>Both were released from detention last week.</p> \n<p>“On an ongoing and constant basis, we are looking at the pressure leverage that we can apply. To the extent necessary, taking all of the interests into account, we will step up the pressure,” Aviram said. Although attention is currently focused on the release of the two residents of Israel, Aviram did not rule out the prospect that conclusions would be drawn that could lead to the formation of a more general policy in similar circumstances.</p> \n<p>At the committee session, Kulanu Knesset member Akram Hasoon took Israeli authorities to task for their conduct in Akel’s case, saying that so far it has only been representatives of the U.S. government who have been in touch with the PA on the matter and have visited Akel in detention. Hassoon said he personally contacted the PA's prosecutor general, who told the Knesset member that no Israeli had asked to meet Akel and Israel had not made a request for his release. As a result, Hassoon said, he himself asked for his release.</p> \n<p>Asked about Akel’s well-being, Aviram, the National Security Council staffer, said: “As far as I know, he is in relatively proper condition. In discussions that I have had, I haven’t heard about any torture that he is undergoing” and that he had had one of more visits. Nonetheless, Aviram noted that someone arrested by the PA apparently would “not basically be facing a good situation.”</p> \n<p>An Israeli resident suspected of cooperating with Israel and was tortured, according to his claims, in a Palestinian detention facility. &quot;I received the death penalty for stopping terror attacks,&quot; he said. &quot;The children I saved are grown up now, half are lawyers and half are doctors. I did the work of god.&quot;</p>",

        "text":["<p>At an Oval Office gathering earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump began touting his administration’s new real estate investment program, which offers massive tax breaks to developers who invest in downtrodden American communities. He then turned to one of the plan’s strongest supporters.</p> \n<p>“Ivanka, would you like to say something?” Trump asked his daughter. “You’ve been pushing this very hard.”</p> \n<p>The Opportunity Zone program promoted by Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner — both senior White House advisers — could also benefit them financially, an Associated Press investigation found.</p> \n<p>Government watchdogs say the case underscores the ethical minefield they created two years ago when they became two of the closest advisers to the president without divesting from their extensive real estate investments.</p> \n<p>Trump and Kushner jointly own a big stake in a real estate investment firm, Cadre, that recently announced it is launching a series of Opportunity Zone funds that seek to build major projects under the program from Miami to Los Angeles. Separately, the couple owns interests in at least 13 properties held by Kushner’s family firm that could qualify for the tax breaks because they are in Opportunity Zones in New Jersey, New York and Maryland — all of which, a study found, were already coming back.</p> \n<p>Six of the Kushner Cos. buildings are in New York City’s Brooklyn Heights area, with views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline, where a five-bedroom apartment recently listed for $8 million. Two more are in the beach town of Long Branch, N.J., where some oceanfront condos within steps of a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant and a Lululemon yoga shop list for as much as $2.7 million.</p> \n<p>There’s no evidence the couple had a hand in selecting any of the nation’s 8,700 Opportunity Zones, and the company has not indicated it plans to seek tax breaks under the new program. But the Kushners could profit even if they don’t do anything — by potentially benefiting from a recent surge in Opportunity Zone property values amid a gold rush of interest from developers and investors.</p> \n<p>Ivanka Trump’s advocacy for the Opportunity Zone program “creates a direct conflict of interest with her spouse’s investment in Cadre,” said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Jared Kushner’s interests are Ivanka Trump’s interests and vice versa.”</p> \n<p>The couple’s financial disclosures show their jointly held financial empire is worth between $200 million and $800 million, with much of it in real estate, including a stake of between $25 million and $50 million in Cadre. Those documents state they must recuse themselves from dealing with policy matters that touch on real estate and “would have a direct and predictable effect on Cadre.” Ivanka Trump also has interests in Trump Organization properties which are not located inside Opportunity Zones.</p> \n<p>“Ms. Trump has divested assets, set up trusts, removed herself from businesses and decisions about her investments,” Abbe Lowell, ethics counsel for the couple, said in a statement. “In addition, she adheres to the ethics advice she has received from counsel about what issues she can work on and those to which she is recused.”</p> \n<p>The Kushner Cos. did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>President Trump was scheduled to attend an Opportunity Zone event in Washington on Wednesday that would depict the program as a boon to distressed communities. White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told the AP that individual state governors of both parties nominate communities for Opportunity Zone designation “based on what underserved areas would benefit most. ... The White House has nothing to do with those decisions.”</p> \n<p>The Investing in Opportunity Act, which became law last December as part of the Republican-sponsored tax overhaul, never gained traction when it was first proposed during the Obama administration, but it quickly found favor in a White House headed and dominated by real estate developers and investors.</p> \n<p>A significant moment came when the law’s key GOP sponsor, South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, met President Trump after the violence-plagued white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August of 2017.</p> \n<p>Trump promised Scott his support for Opportunity Zones as a way to show his administration’s outreach to minority communities. But Scott had already found a supporter weeks earlier in Trump’s daughter, in conversations that grew out of previous meetings about passing a child care tax credit.</p> \n<p>Political sponsors and lobbyists told the AP that Ivanka Trump played an important role in promoting the legislation, while Kushner was also quietly supportive behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>“Ivanka was on board with it,” said Sean Smith, Scott’s communications director. After their first conversation, Smith said Scott and Ivanka Trump talked by phone and in person nearly a dozen times. He added that Scott also spoke to Kushner about the program, but noted, “It was much more Ivanka than Jared.”</p> \n<p>A team from Economic Innovation Group, or EIG, a Washington think tank that pioneered the Opportunity Zones concept, met with top Kushner aides Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell two weeks before the tax reform bill was passed.</p> \n<p>Funded by Napster founder and early Facebook investor Sean Parker, EIG spent more than $1.4 million on lobbying over the past two years, both before and after the Investing in Opportunity Act passed. The group met with White House officials every quarter since the start of the Trump administration, and also met with frequently with officials from Treasury and other White House agencies, records show.</p> \n<p>“Creating the incentive to bring capital into communities that are currently being overlooked is just a tremendous opportunity,” Ivanka Trump said as her father and a crowd of supporters nodded during the White House session February 14.</p> \n<p>Last month, at a dinner in Washington put on by the conservative Kemp Foundation, Scott singled out Ivanka Trump as his point person on the initiative. “When we were looking for help to get the tax bill across the finish line,” he said, “I kept looking to the same person for help in the White House.”</p> \n<p>There is no indication the couple directly intervened in the shaping of the Opportunity Zone program specifically to advance their financial interests. And public officials say there is no evidence that any actions were taken to influence the selection of Opportunity Zone boundaries.</p> \n<p>But backers of the program acknowledge that Ivanka Trump’s out-front role drummed up interest from public officials and financial stakeholders.</p> \n<p>Along with the Kushner-tied Cadre Opportunity Zone funds, more than 50 real estate and private equity interests have made plans in recent weeks to create investment funds under the program, including several with ties to the couple and the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>Last month, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci launched an opportunity zone fund tied to his Skybridge Capital investment firm, aiming to build projects worth more than $3 billion. Opportunity Zone funds have also been set up recently by New York-based Normandy Real Estate Partners and Heritage Equity Partners, two firms that have worked with Kushner Cos. on real estate ventures.</p> \n<p>They are flocking to what financial analysts say are some of the most generous tax benefits they have ever seen. Investors who plow capital gains from previous investments into Opportunity Zone projects can defer taxes on those gains up to 2026. If they decide not to cash out their investment for seven years, they get to exclude up to 15 percent of those gains from taxes. And they can permanently avoid paying taxes on any new gains from investment in the zones if they hold onto the investment for a decade. With capital gains taxes as high as 23.8 percent, the savings can easily add up.</p> \n<p>Government officials have estimated the program would cost $1.5 billion in lost tax revenue over 10 years, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has estimated the zones would attract up to $100 billion in renewal efforts.</p> \n<p>While the Opportunity Zone program mostly targets census tracts of high poverty and unemployment, it also allows “contiguous” tracts that might not be low-income, but are close enough to deprived communities to be eligible.</p> \n<p>Critics say that could allow developers to cash in by targeting zones already teeming with investment and gentrified neighborhoods. Amazon’s recent decision to locate a new headquarters in the bustling New York City neighborhood of Long Island City, for example, drew rebukes following reports it was in an Opportunity Zone.</p> \n<p>A study by the Urban Institute in Washington found that nearly a third of the more than 8,700 Opportunity Zones nationwide — and all 13 of the ones containing Kushner properties — were showing signs of heavy investment and gentrification, based on such factors as rent increases and the percentage of college-educated residents.</p> \n<p>The Kushners’ most immediate advantage could come from their investment in Cadre. CEO Ryan Williams announced late last month that Cadre was starting up an Opportunity Zone fund that would aim to build major development projects in designated areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Miami.</p> \n<p>The company said the program “fits with Cadre’s commitment to identifying opportunities in less-advantaged areas that are primed for growth.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>There is nothing earth-shattering about seeing Women’s March leader and Arab-American activist Linda Sarsour criticized as a dangerous Islamist by the conservative right and pro-Israel advocates in the United States. But the latest attack on the activist comes from a new and somewhat surprising source: Saudi Arabia.</p> \n<p>Al Arabiya, a Saudi-owned, pan-Arab news channel closely linked to the country’s royal family and widely viewed as reflecting Saudi foreign policy, published an article Sunday strongly suggesting that Sarsour and two incoming Muslim congresswomen are puppets planted by the Muslim Brotherhood and Qatar to undermine the Trump administration.</p> \n<p>The feature, which profiles Sarsour, seems to cast her as the latest proxy figure in the kingdom’s bitter dispute with Qatar, and its bid to strengthen ties and curry favor with the White House.</p> \n<p>It also focused on two Democratic politicians whom Sarsour actively campaigned for in the 2018 midterms: Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, who are set to be the first-ever Muslim congresswomen when the House reconvenes in January.</p> \n<p>Headlined “Details of calls to attack Trump by US ‘Muslim Sisters’ allied to Brotherhood,” the article is light on actual details but heavy on insinuation.</p> \n<p>Activists like Sarsour, and politicians like Tlaib and Omar, the Saudi publication wrote, are “mujahideen” (a term used to describe those involved in jihad) – fighting against “tyrants and opponents of Trump’s foreign policies.”</p> \n<p>The story says the policies they are fighting include “the siege of Iran, the fight against political Islam groups, and [Trump’s] choice of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of King Salman bin Abdulaziz and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a strategic ally.”</p> \n<p>Tlaib and Omar, Al Arabiya asserts, are agents designed to “restore” control of political Islamist movements on the U.S. government by attacking Trump. The article says this effort is being directed by Sarsour – who, it writes, is purportedly funded and controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood&nbsp;- a claim it fails to provide any clear basis for.</p> \n<p>Tamara Cofman Wittes, a senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, Washington, says it should come as little surprise to those familiar with the region that “a state-owned Arabic news outlet would publish conspiracy theories about people whose views don’t accord with those of the government that funds it.”</p> \n<p>Al Arabiya, based in Dubai, but Saudi-owned, was founded in 2002 as a counter to Qatar’s popular Al Jazeera TV station – which frequently runs material sharply critical of the Saudis – as well as other Arabic media outlets critical of Saudi influence and supportive of political Islam.</p> \n<p>The article comes as rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Qatar has heated up in recent times, with Qatar’s emir skipping this weekend’s Gulf Cooperation Council summit hosted by Saudi Arabia, which has led a diplomatic war on its neighbor for the past 18 months.</p> \n<p>Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt cut diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar in June 2017, charging that the country supports terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the Saudi boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty. Last week, the Gulf nation announced it was withdrawing from the OPEC oil cartel.</p> \n<p>Islamists vs Islamists</p> \n<p>“Democrats’ battle against the Republican control of the U.S. Congress led to an alliance with political Islamist movements in order to restore their control on government, pushing Muslim candidates and women activists of immigrant minorities onto the electoral scene,” the report states.</p> \n<p>The “common ground” between Omar and Tlaib, the article adds, is to battle Trump’s foreign policy “starting from the sanctions on Iran to the isolation of the Muslim Brotherhood and all movements of political Islam. Those sponsoring and supporting the two Muslim women to reach the U.S. Congress adopted a tactic to infiltrate through their immigrant and black minority communities in general, and women’s groups in particular.</p> \n<p>The article ties Sarsour to Qatar and the Muslim Brotherhood through multiple associations with the Arab American Association of New York, which “was created by Palestinian Ahmed Jaber, a member of the Qatar International Foundation responsible for funding the association,” and also her attendance at an annual meeting of the International Network of Muslim Brotherhood in North America and Canada in 2016.</p> \n<p>The article compares Sarsour’s rhetoric to that “used by Muslim Brotherhood teachings and in the views of Sayyid Qutb, a scholar and co-founder of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, as well as from Abul A’la Maududi’s books ‘Islam and Ignorance’ and ‘Fundamentals of Islam.’</p> \n<p>“From all that is mentioned, we can touch the influence of Muslim Brotherhood in shaping the thoughts of American activist Linda Sarsour and consequently her declaring her ‘jihad’ against U.S. President Donald Trump, in addition to her call for the application of ‘Sharia,’ the rule of Islam in the United States of America,” the piece asserts.</p> \n<p>No one knows for sure whether Al Arabiya received direct orders from the Saudi government to attack Sarsour, Tlaib, Omar and other politically active Muslim women on the American left.</p> \n<p>Those familiar with Middle East media say conspiracy-minded attacks against figures in American politics aren’t particularly unusual in Arabic, but what is unique about this article is the fact it appeared in English on the network's website.</p> \n<p>It seems to be a highly creative attempt to somehow repay the Trump White House as it deals with the fallout from the Jamal Khashoggi assassination. As Trump continues to take heat for staying close to the Saudis, they, in turn, are demonstrating their loyalty with their willingness to vilify people who were President Barack Obama’s supporters and are now Trump’s political enemies – even if they wear a hijab.</p>",

        "text":["<p>A tired Matteo Salvini looked as if the only thing on his mind Tuesday night was getting back to his hotel and going to sleep. The Italian deputy prime minister had already flown in from Rome earlier that day, been taken by helicopter to tour Israel’s northern border, prayed at the Western Wall and had meetings with the Vatican’s representative in the Holy Land. But the organizers of his whirlwind trip to Israel had also for some reason scheduled a late-night bar crawl through Jerusalem’s swiftly gentrifying Mahane Yehuda market.</p> \n<p>Read More:&nbsp;Splitting the EU: Israel’s tightening alliance with Central Europe’s nationalist leaders&nbsp;■&nbsp;After U.S. midterms, the next clash between democracy and populism will be in Europe</p> \n<p>Yet when reporters asked Salvini (also Italy’s interior minister) about the next day’s schedule, he immediately perked up and an almost-dreamy look fell upon his face. He was to meet Benjamin Netanyahu for the first time in the morning, and admitted he was “curious” and saw the Israeli prime minister as “an inspiration.”</p> \n<p>He was looking forward to talking with Bibi about “counterterrorism, high-tech and universities,” but above all he just seemed excited about finally spending time with the man who has become a father figure to right-wing nationalist leaders around the world.</p> \n<p>The most powerful man in Italy (Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a technocrat, appointed as a compromise by the governing coalition), Salvini is leader of the League – the formerly northern separatist party (Lega Nord) that under his leadership has become a pan-Italian party, championing anti-immigrant policies. It performed surprisingly well in last March’s parliamentary election.</p> \n<p>His left-wing critics call him a neofascist, while the League’s coalition partner – the polyglot, ultra-populist Five Star Movement – is unhappy with what increasingly looks like an uneven partnership. The League is ending 2018 as the largest party in the polls, by a wide margin, and many political analysts predict Salvini will be prime minister in his own right before long.</p> \n<p>He has a strong claim to being the most important nationalist politician in Western Europe today – which makes it extremely interesting that he chose to make Israel his first trip outside of Europe (aside from the G-20 in Argentina) since becoming deputy leader. It was Salvini who requested the meeting with Netanyahu, not the Israeli side.</p> \n<p>In a year that has seen visits to Israel by such leaders as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and, from further afield, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, it is clear that the Bibi pilgrimage has become a rite of passage for a certain kind of foreign politician.</p> \n<p>It is clear what they come for on the political level: Politicians who are historically tainted with their party’s past associations with fascist and neo-Nazi roots can get Israel’s kashrut stamp by visiting the Western Wall and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.</p> \n<p>And Netanyahu isn’t just the leader of the Jewish state. He is also widely, and probably justifiably, seen as the world leader with the best personal and political relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump – the road to Trump’s Washington goes through Jerusalem. There are also commercial, technological and security agreements to be had.</p> \n<p>But there seems to be an even deeper ideological attraction. In an era when smaller nations are emphasizing their nationalist symbols and defying larger neighbors and international bodies like the European Union, Netanyahu is a source of inspiration: The prime minister who defied President Barack Obama for nearly his entire two terms and is still standing. Who stood up to the international community over the Iran nuclear deal. Who has resolutely refused any concessions to the Palestinians and boycotts the EU’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu is the contrarian nationalist leader who has proved you can get away with it. And they all want some of that aura.</p> \n<p>The Israeli premier obviously adores the adulation. He also calculates that cultivating relations with the more Euroskeptic elements of the EU – like Salvini, Orb&aacute;n (and other members of the Visegr&aacute;d Group) and the Baltic states – will help to disrupt European policies on Iran and the Palestinian issue.</p> \n<p>But is he not taking a risk by trying to ride Europe’s nationalist tiger?</p> \n<p>In recent weekends, the EU’s key members have faced political turmoil. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has been forced to abandon his tax plans after rioting by the Yellow Vest (Gilets Jaunes) movement. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has managed to hang on with a weakened governing coalition, but has already handed over the leadership of her weakened CDU party and is entering the twilight of her career. In Brexit Britain, it’s still unclear if and how the country will crash out of the EU next March.</p> \n<p>The old political parties in France have already collapsed and Macron’s new, centrist Onward! (En Marche!) party, which only a year ago was created out of nothing and swept to power, is looking increasingly like a one-term wonder. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative and Labour parties – which have alternately held power for a century – both seem closer than ever to splitting. Similar dynamics are being replicated across the Continent.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu, who loves the label of being “the first to identify,” has for years been betting on the European antiestablishment right – long before populism became the byword for contemporary politics.</p> \n<p>But if the political makeup of the protesters in France is anything to go by, it could go either way. They include many who voted last year for the far-right Front National (now called National Rally), but also voters from the far-left Unbowed France (“La France Insoumise”).</p> \n<p>Someone like Salvini, who has not been tainted personally by anti-Semitism and has long presented himself as a staunch supporter of Israel, may be desirable to Netanyahu. But a Europe increasingly gripped by the likes of Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon (and his British counterpart, Jeremy Corbyn), who may occupy opposite poles of political ideology but share a hatred of the old establishment and are hostile to Israel – as well as having bad relations with their local Jewish communities – is another matter.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu favors a disjointed and weakened EU, one that is unable to talk in a joint voice on the matters that are important to him. But he should be careful what he wishes for. Europe is still Israel’s largest trading partner, the source of hundreds of millions of euros in research funds – and until the Arab world finally opens up to Israel, it’s also the most important neighbor the country has.</p> \n<p>For domestic political reasons, and short-term diplomatic gains, Netanyahu has promoted the image of a hostile “anti-Israel” EU. But he knows better than most that this isn’t the reality. The likes of Salvini may be his starry-eyed fans, but a Europe riven by nationalism and extremism will not be in Israel’s interests.</p>",

Kav La’Oved, a hotline that protects worker’s rights, has filed dozens of complaints on behalf of victims of human trafficking and slavery who have not received the discount.</p> \n<p>The law providing the 6 percent rate for asylum seekers who were victims of human trafficking or slavery was approved by the Knesset in July and went into effect with November’s wages, which are paid in December. The new law also provides the 6 percent rate to men over the age of 60 as well as to women of any age, juveniles and those suffering from serious illness.</p> \n<p>The 400 recognized victims of human trafficking are actually among the smaller, but most vulnerable groups entitled to the 6 percent rate, Noa Kaufman, a manager at Kav La’Oved noted. But this vulnerable minority is facing the most hurdles, which means they are continuing to lose 20 percent of their salaries.</p> \n<p>Unlike women and older men, which the Population and Immigration Authority automatically recognizes as being entitled to the lower rate, victims of human trafficking are required to produce confirmation from the police of their entitlement. But in addition, Kav La’Oved has found that in violation of the rules, human trafficking victims have also been facing an additional bureaucratic hurdle, required to also present an authorization from the Population Authority’s unit that enforces the law on foreigners in Israel.</p> \n<p>Employees who have confirmation from the police have contacted Kav La’Oved for guidance on how to secure the reduced rate, but the organization has been unable to get an answer from the Population Authority. When Haaretz enquired into the matter, the Population Authority said that no confirmation other than that from the police is required.</p> \n<p>Data that the state provided to the High Court of Justice show that the 20 percent deduction, which the asylum seekers receive when they leave the country, push the available wages of half of the asylum seekers in Israel below the minimum wage.</p>",

Instead, he has offered that his party's number two assume the position.</p> \n<p>Zaatry – chief of Haifa's Hadash party branch – said Wednesday that he is not sorry and will not retract his past statements against Zionism and supporting the actions of Hamas and Hezbollah, which sparked the backlash against him.</p> \n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Haifa's mayor-elect, Einat Kalisch Rotem, on Sunday to request that she cancel Zaatry's appointment, but she refused, saying that she has no intention to break coalition agreements.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Raja Zaatry has a right to be deputy mayor of Haifa | Haaretz Editorial ■&nbsp;Mayor of Haifa, don’t give in | Haaretz Editorial ■&nbsp;Israeli non-racists, first we take Haifa! | Opinion</p> \n<p>According to a source with knowledge on the matter, Kalisch Rotem asked Zaatry to walk back some of his past remarks. In the past, Zaatry has said that Hamas and Hezbollah are not terror organizations and that their resistance to the occupation is legitimate.</p> \n<p>Haifa municipality officials met with Zaatry this week and described the pressures mounted on them in order to cancel his appointment. In response, Zaatry offered that his number two, Shahira Shalabi, receive the appointment in his stead. He said he was thinking only of what's best for the city.</p> \n<p>&quot;A people that oppose the occupation have the right to resist with all legitimate means,&quot; he said Wednesday. He added that he opposes terrorism and harming innocent people on both sides, and called Netanyahu &quot;the inciter from Balfour Street,&quot; referring to the premier's official Jerusalem residence.</p> \n<p>The pressure applied by Netanyahu came after&nbsp;Interior Minister Arye Dery tweeted&nbsp;on Friday that he would find out whether he could legally block Zaatry's appointment.</p> \n<p>Zaatry&nbsp;&quot;has expressed support for Hezbollah and&nbsp;Hamas, has supported boycotts of Israel and action against Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Such a person cannot be named as a deputy mayor, as Haifa’s mayor seeks to do,” Dery tweeted.</p> \n<p>&quot;A government that acts like the mob, what is this thing?&quot; Zaatry said in response to Dery and Netanyahu's pressure. &quot;Threatening a mayor that she won't get budgets? This is a democracy?&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>In a conversation with Haaretz, Zaatry said that the incitement on the web made him a target. &quot;Statements such as 'He should be seated on an electrical chair, not a deputy chair' and 'Put a bullet in his head' - even the police called me to ask me who's behind those remarks,&quot; he told Haaretz. &quot;How should I know? If it was an Arab, they'd have found him already,&quot; he said.&quot;</p> \n<p>Zaatry said that as a result, &quot;I don't walk around alone.&quot;</p> \n<p>He talked about the pressures mounted on Kalisch Rotem, saying she was told &quot;that no minister would see her as long as she has a 'terror-backing' deputy and that she wouldn't get budgets.&quot; He said that he didn't think he had another option but to give up his appointment: &quot;The prime minister put his entier weight behind this thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>According to Zaatry, Kalisch Rotem and her no. 2 &quot;were very elegant. They didn't ask me to apologize. They didn't dictate anything.&quot;</p> \n<p>Following Zaatry's announcement Shalabi said: &quot;I respect Haifa's residents. It's a city that has remained sane. That opposes incitement and racism. The Israeli public wants us.

        "text":["<p>A gunman killed at least three people and wounded 12 others near a Christmas market in the French border city of Strasbourg on Tuesday evening before being cornered by police.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>About 600 security agents are hunting for the gunman, Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who fled the scene.The mother, father and two brothers of the Strasbourg shooting suspect are being held in custody for questioning, said sources close to the investigation.</p> \n<p>The Strasbourg prefecture said the gunman shot dead three&nbsp;people, revising down a previous death toll of three.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Police officials said Chekatt was wounded in a gunfight with soldiers after the Tuesday night attack but escaped, and a top official said he might have escaped to neighboring Germany.</p> \n<p>&quot;The hunt is continuing,&quot; Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said on France Inter radio. Asked whether the suspect might have left France, he said: &quot;That cannot be ruled out.&quot;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;With the gunman on the run, France raised its security threat to the highest alert level, strengthening controls on its border with Germany as elite commandos backed by helicopters hunted for the suspect.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>French and German agents checked vehicles and trams crossing the Europa Bridge on the Rhine river, along which the Franco-German frontier runs, police said, backing up traffic in both directions. Hundreds of French troops and police were taking part in the manhunt.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>It was unclear if the market — a popular gathering place and the nucleus of an al-Qaida-linked plot in 2000 — was the intended target. The assailant got inside a security zone around the venue and opened fire from there, Mayor Roland Ries said on BFM television.</p> \n<p>A terrorism investigation was opened, but the motive of the attack is unclear. Nunez said eight of the injured are in serious condition, and the city mayor said some had head wounds.</p> \n<p>The motive was not immediately clear but, with France still on high alert after a wave of attacks commissioned or inspired by Islamic State militants since early 2015, the counter-terrorism prosecutor opened an investigation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>French military spokesman Col. Patrik Steiger said the shooter didn't seem to be aiming at soldiers patrolling in and around the market, but appeared to target civilians instead.</p> \n<p>Some three&nbsp;hours after the attack, elite police cornered the suspect and shots were fired, a source close to the operation said. French media reported the assailant was holed up in a store on the Rue Epinal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the gunman was known to security services, and the local prefecture said he was on an intelligence services watchlist.&nbsp;Chekatt&nbsp;had been imprisoned in Germany in 2016 and 2017 on theft charges, and was deported to France in 2017, a spokeswoman for Germany's BKA criminal police said.</p> \n<p>People in the city's Neudorf area and Etoile park were told to stay where they were as officers hunted the shooter on the ground and from the air.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The European Parliament, which is sitting in Strasbourg this week, was put into lockdown.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tight Security</p> \n<p>The Christmas market was being held amid tight security this year, with unauthorized vehicles excluded from surrounding streets during opening hours and checkpoints set up on bridges and access points to search pedestrians' bags.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Paris prosecutor said the motive for the attack was not known. No group immediately claimed responsibility but the U.S.-based site Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters celebrated the attack.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Police had searched the suspect's home early on Tuesday, before the attack during a homicide investigation, Nunez said. Five people have been questioned as part of that investigation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>President Emmanuel Macron was was being updated as events unfurled, an Elysee Palace official said. Castaner was on his way to Strasbourg, which lies on the border with Germany.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The gunman entered the market over a bridge at about 8 P.M. before opening fire, the prefecture said, adding that the suspect was a known security risk and on a watch list.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the European Parliament said the building had been shut down and staff ordered to stay inside.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;My thoughts are with the victims of the Strasbourg shooting, which I condemn with the utmost firmness,&quot; tweeted Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the European Commission, the EU executive. &quot;Strasbourg is an excellent symbol of peace and European Democracy. Values that we will always defend.&quot;&nbsp;  Watchlist</p> \n<p>The attack took place at a testing time for President Emmanuel Macron, who is struggling to quell a&nbsp;month-long public revolt&nbsp;over high living costs that has spurred the worst public unrest in central Paris since the 1968 student riots.</p> \n<p>The revelation that Chekatt was on a security watchlist will raise questions over possible intelligence failures, but some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the &quot;Fiche S&quot; watchlist. Of these, about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalised, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, online or abroad.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>European security agencies have feared for some time that Islamist militants who left Europe to fight for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq would return after the jihadist group's defeat, with the skills and motivation to carry out attacks at home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Secular France has been grappling with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond since 2015.</p> \n<p>In 2016, a truck ploughed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people, while in November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. There have also been attacks in Paris on a policeman on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Almost exactly two years ago, a Tunisian Islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a Christmas market in central Berlin, killing 11 people as well as the driver.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Nature reserves and other open spaces near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip stand to suffer irreversible damage if more fires break out in the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority said Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Such blazes have been plaguing the area in recent months due to airborne firebombs being hurled into Israel from Gaza. The last of the fires was in November.</p> \n<p>Two-thirds of the 32,000 dunams (8,000 acres) damaged by incendiary devices thrown from the Strip were in nature reserves and forests near the border, the parks authority said. The remaining third is mostly agricultural land.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; We flew a drone over the fires raging around Gaza. This is what we saw&nbsp;■&nbsp;Analysis:&nbsp;Israel paints airborne firebombs as a national disaster – and Hamas reaps the benefit</p> \n<p>The parks authority’s chief scientist, Yehoshua Shkedi, said major damage was not only caused by the fires themselves but also as a result of operations that firefighters carried out there.</p> \n<p>In a presentation on Tuesday summarizing the work of the parks authority this year, Shkedi said there were instances in which it would have been better to let a small fire burn rather than risking damage to a larger area from firefighting and the incursion of motor vehicles on the ground.</p> \n<p>“Natural areas in the Eastern Mediterranean have learned to adapt to fires over thousands of years and to recover,” Shkedi explained, “but it’s another story if these fires continue. The areas cannot stand up to waves of damage like that.”</p> \n<p>Although the spate of incendiary devices flown from Gaza has stopped, parks authority staff are preparing for the possibility that they would resume, and are getting ready to minimize the damage. The plans include working with firefighting services on what equipment they would dispatch to nature areas and which access routes they would take to reduce the harm that this causes. The parks authority would also work to identify invasive species of plants that might spread into areas where fires had occurred – an invasion which would also prevent the areas from recovering.</p> \n<p>In contrast to areas near the border with Gaza, other parts of Israel saw a decline in the number of fires in 2018. In 2016, there were 382 fires in national parks and nature reserves around the country that burned 59,000 dunams of land. This year, if the Gaza border area is excluded, the number has declined to 240 fires, affecting 28,000 dunams.</p> \n<p>One of the main reasons for the decline in the number of fires around the country is a change in the conduct of army units, which began to take measures to prevent the outbreak of fires from training exercises and to extinguish those that do break out itself, parks authority director general Shaul Goldstein said.</p> \n<p>Army training activity was the main cause of&nbsp;fires of a substantial scope&nbsp;in the parks and nature reserves. Despite the major improvement, army training exercises are still the leading cause of fires in the parks and nature reserves.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Al-QAIM, Iraq -&nbsp;From a desert hillside guarded by Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitaries, commander Qasim Muslih can spot Islamic State hideouts across the frontier in&nbsp;Syria. But he also keeps a wary eye on U.S. warplanes soaring overhead.</p> \n<p>&quot;The Americans are spying on us,&quot; he said, squinting skywards. &quot;But we can hold the borders. We'll fight whoever lays a finger on Iraq and its holy shrines.&quot;</p> \n<p>The fighters Muslih commands are part of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a grouping of mostly Shi'ite militias backed by Iran, which the United States regards as the biggest threat to security in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>The PMF has been deploying in growing numbers at the border, fearing hundreds of Islamic State militants who fled Iraq are trying to cross back into Iraqi territory.</p> \n<p>The deployment is strengthening the PMF's de facto control over large stretches of the frontier while its leaders are calling for a formal, permanent role securing the border.</p> \n<p>But with fewer Sunni militants to contend with on the Iraqi side a year after Baghdad declared victory over ISIS, many Shi'ite paramilitaries now see the United States as a bigger threat.</p> \n<p>The White House has indicated the U.S. military presence is as much about countering Iran's influence as fighting ISIS, which is also known as ISIS. Asked about the suggestion of spying on the PMF, a coalition spokesman said: &quot;The Coalition is concerned with the enduring defeat of ISIS.&quot;</p> \n<p>As the battle against a mutual foe rumbles on, Washington and Tehran are keeping a close eye on each other in this part of the region, raising the risk of new violence.</p> \n<p>The PMF officially became part of Iraq's security forces this year after playing an important role fighting ISIS.</p> \n<p>Factions including Iran-backed groups that fight inside&nbsp;Syria&nbsp;have concentrated their recent build-up around the town of al-Qaim, which was recaptured from ISIS in November 2017 and was the last ISIS bastion in Iraq to fall last year.</p> \n<p>The PMF control movement in and out of the town near the border with&nbsp;Syria. One commander, Abu Seif al-Tamimi, said the PMF now held a 240-km (150-mile) stretch of frontier in the area.</p> \n<p>&quot;We're ready to take over security,&quot; Muslih said in al-Qaim. &quot;We liberated these areas and didn't need help from the Americans.&quot;</p> \n<p>Military commanders in units not allied with Iran say U.S. air power was crucial to the defeat of ISIS in a three-year campaign involving the military, Iraqi Kurdish fighters and the PMF.</p> \n<p>U.S. forces have kept their bases in place. On the road to al-Qaim, U.S. armoured vehicles passed PMF pickup trucks with masked fighters behind machine guns.</p> \n<p>'WILD WEST SITUATION'</p> \n<p>South of the town there are signs of growing PMF control and an increasingly crowded battlefield. The watchtowers of Iraq's border guard which nominally polices the frontier disappear, and the paramilitaries are the only force. Flags of Shi'ite factions fly at outposts a short drive from a one of the U.S. bases.</p> \n<p>In&nbsp;Syria, the U.S. coalition supports Kurdish-led forces who control areas east of the Euphrates and have been fighting off a new IS offensive. In Iraq it supports the Iraqi military.</p> \n<p>Fighting the militants on the other side of the river is the&nbsp;Syrian army, backed by Iran, Russia and the PMF, whose elite factions straddle the frontier.</p> \n<p>A fighter at one outpost said a U.S. warplane recently made a low pass over their position. &quot;They're trying to scare us,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>Tension rose in June when the PMF blamed the United States for the deaths of 22 of its fighters in an air strike near the border and threatened to retaliate.</p> \n<p>The U.S. coalition denied involvement in the strike.</p> \n<p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said &quot;outright&quot; aggression was not expected by Shi'ite militias before ISIS was fully defeated.</p> \n<p>&quot;The question is what are they going to do once things are done,&quot; the official said.</p> \n<p>The build-up of forces already risks a clash even if both sides wish to avoid it, said Philip Smyth, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</p> \n<p>&quot;Nearly every major Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia has forces deployed near al-Qaim ... that is the glowing hot dot on the map,&quot; he said. &quot;The danger is always there (and) the Americans clearly don't have the forces to handle that.

        "text":["<p>A striking photograph by Alexandre Guirkinger shows a large concrete cube covered with dark green moss, standing in the heart of a forest. Bunker 5 is a remnant of the Maginot Line, which in the 1930s separated France from Germany and was supposed to prevent a Nazi invasion. We know how that ended. Eighty years on, the line has undergone fascinating metamorphoses. The vegetation that covers both bunkers and memory seems wondrous. The horror has been aestheticized. The green gives rise to life after death.</p> \n<p>A few minutes later, as I stood opposite Micha Bar-Am’s marvelous photographs of the Bar-Lev Line along the Suez Canal in the early 1970s, it struck me that it’s unfortunate that no documentation exists of what has survived from that famous line of outposts today. Is “Budapest” still there, or “Purkan” or “Hamezah”? Are they, too, covered by green moss?</p> \n<p>“Bunker 5” is one of a dozen shots taken by French photographer Guirkinger that are now on view at the Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery at Tel Aviv University, as part of an exhibition titled “Defense Lines: Maginot, Bar-Lev and Beyond.” The exhibition, as a close perusal reveals, allows the visitor to see life in Israel, and in general, as one long sequence of building fortifications. Some of them will turn out to be superfluous – or stupid.</p> \n<p>The list of defense lines close to home in Israel is a long one, and includes (just in the past few decades), the outposts on the road to Jerusalem, Ammunition Hill, the Bar-Lev Line, the mine fields in the Arava desert and on the Golan Heights, the fortifications in the Jordan Rift Valley, the separation barrier that snakes around the West Bank, and, at present, the immense wall across from and around the Gaza Strip. Names change, defense remains. Of the sites mentioned above, only two – the Bar-Lev Line and the separation barrier – are seen in the show, but the others are hovering just above.</p> \n<p>It’s important to remember that such barriers and fortifications are not an Israeli invention. Hadrian’s Wall, in northern England, which is 120 kilometers long, reminds those who walk along it that superfluous walls were already being built 2,000 years ago – and that particular one didn’t prevent the “savage” Scots from invading southward.</p> \n<p>The works of seven participants appear in “Defense Lines.” A double video by Marina Abramovi and Ulay shows a walk along the Great Wall of China. Amir Balaban’s wonderful videos capture gazelles on both sides of Israel’s separation barrier, while Netta Laufer’s videos are taken from the surveillance cameras installed along the barrier. Also on display are Micha Bar-Am’s images from the Bar-Lev Line and Guirkinger’s from the Maginot Line; Yael Lavie’s reconstruction of the Egyptians’ breaching the Bar-Lev Line; and two photographs of the wall between the United States and Mexico by Assaf Evron.</p> \n<p>That list clearly shows the scale of the phenomenon in question. At least two of the most interesting participants – Balaban (an expert on urban nature) and Lavie (a journalist and media figure) – don’t describe themselves (in my opinion) as artists per se, yet their works are among the most important and intriguing in the show.</p> \n<p>The power of “Defense Lines” derives from the fine curating effort. The chief curators are Galia Gur Zeev and Sefy Hendler; the concept was developed by Dr. Ayelet Zohar. The result is a large and diverse range of gazes at a subject that is ostensibly straightforward as well as acutely relevant.</p> \n<p>After my visit, while I was contemplating what the exhibition is about, it became clear that it’s not actually about art or architecture: “Defense Lines” deals with human folly, with memory, nature, current events, aesthetics, interpersonal relations, fear and the big question of the passage of time.</p> \n<p>At an exhibition of works by seven different people, it’s only natural for some of their creations to be more powerful than others. The photos by Bar-Am (and others of their ilk) have already been exhibited in the past. They are certainly first-rate and very well suited to the concept, but they don’t really say much that’s new. Thus, it is the video works by Balaban, Lavie and Laufer that are the best and most refreshing elements on display here. The works by Balaban and Lavie are journalistic documentation, and that’s the source of their power.</p> \n<p>The video by Marina Abramovi is interesting – she and her partner Ulay marked their pre-planned breakup by walking simultaneously from both directions along the Great Wall of China, until they met 90 days later. But beyond the somewhat familiar insight that defense lines exist within our psyche, just as they do in the very real Great Wall, there’s not much to it.</p> \n<p>On display in one of the halls are photos of the World War II fortifications at Normandy by Paul Virilio. Virilio – a French professor of architecture and philosophy, who conducted a dialogue with the curators while they were preparing their exhibition – died this year and the show is dedicated to his memory. In his book “Bunker Architecture” (1975), Virilio defined the bunker as a rare example of modern monolithic architecture; in contrast to most structures, it lacks foundations and reflects the very essence of war.</p> \n<p>Afterward, the questions remain. What prompts people to engage in this insane form of construction? What sort of anxiety causes people to invest such vast sums of money, emotional strength and relentless energy in building lines of defense full of concrete, which, as the past has shown, will only collapse? Every exhibition that generates questions of this nature deserves respect and praise.</p> \n<p>Two concluding notes: Haaretz is one of the show’s sponsors, along with Tel Aviv University, the Foreign Ministry, the French Embassy and the National Institute for Security Studies; the university’s Theater Arts Departmen will perform the play “The Claim of Don Quixote,” by Gilad Evron, at the gallery as part of the exhibition. Entry to the gallery is free, which is also praiseworthy. (A ticket to the Tel Aviv Museum of Art costs 50 shekels ($13.40); to the Eretz Israel Museum 52 shekels; and to the university’s Steinhardt Museum of Natural History 50 shekels.)</p> \n<p>The Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery, 64 Haim Levanon Street, Gate 7 of the university; Tel.: 03-6408860; Sun.-Wed. 11-19, Thu. 11-21, Fri. 11-14; exhibition runs until June 6, 1919</p>",

        "text":["<p>In public, Nancy Pelosi lectured Donald Trump on the Constitution and wagged a finger at him for charachterizing her “strength.” In private, she questioned his “manhood” — with her disdain for him, ironically, becoming public again.</p> \n<p>“It’s like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him. This wall thing,” Pelosi privately told House Democrats after a&nbsp;combative, on-camera Oval Office meeting&nbsp;with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The account was described on condition of anonymity by an aide who was in the room but is not authorized to discuss Pelosi’s remarks publicly.</p> \n<p>In the space of a few hours Tuesday, the California Democrat, nominated for her second stint as House speaker, rolled out her approach to the Republican president as the two prepare for two years of divided government.</p> \n<p>“It goes to show you: You get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you,” she said after Tuesday’s meeting, according to the aide.</p> \n<p>Pelosi is said to frown on truly blue language. But in public and private, she can be unsparing in her clapbacks, and never more so than during the Trump presidency. She questioned Trump’s “manhood” publicly in October at Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, for example. And yet, she’s long counseled Democrats to not get into the muck, Trump-style, advising Democrats before the State of the Union address in January not to get in the way of his “slobbering self.”</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, outside the White House, Pelosi predicted Democrats would stay “dignified.”</p> \n<p>Pelosi hardly saved her disdain for Trump for a private audience, letting it rip in slightly more respectful tones a few hours earlier when the president invited journalists into the Oval Office for talks over the national budget. What ensued was a political cage match, with everyone except Pence jumping in with ripostes, setups, lectures and insults. The conflict between Trump and Pelosi dominated the scene, which was replete with gender politics.</p> \n<p>The spectacle suggested a fierce, two-year struggle in which Democrats control one chamber of Congress for the first time in Trump’s presidency. The new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3, and Pelosi will be nominated for her second stint as speaker of the House, a position which puts her second in the line of presidential succession. That carries significant stakes for Trump, who faces oversight investigations into his presidential campaign and administration. Additionally, the House will include a record number of women elected— most of them Democrats — with movements like #MeToo injecting gender into political discussion like never before.</p> \n<p>In her opening comments in the Oval Office, Pelosi said failed budget talks would result in a “Trump shutdown” of government — a phrase that might have inflamed him. Instead, Trump said he’d take responsibility for any shuttering of government.</p> \n<p>Trump also alluded to the fact that Pelosi’s election as speaker is not assured.</p> \n<p>“Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy for her to talk right now, and I understand, and I fully understand that,” Trump said.</p> \n<p>Pelosi raised a hand and then wagged her index finger: “Mr. President, please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.”</p> \n<p>She kept it clean through a post-Oval Office press conference, suggesting to reporters that she didn’t want to embarrass Trump over his misstatement of facts in front of the cameras.</p> \n<p>Behind the scenes is another story, and out came her gibe about Trump’s masculinity.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, she told Democrats privately, “He said at the end of the meeting, he said, ‘We can go two routes with this meeting: with a knife or a candy. I said, ‘Exactly.’”</p> \n<p>She went with the knife.</p> \n<p>“I told him about Ronald Reagan,” Pelosi explained to Democrats. “I said you probably don’t know who I spoke most about on the campaign trail — what president I spoke most about. He said, ‘Donald Trump.’ I said, ‘I never mentioned your name.’”</p> \n<p>Later in private, she told the Democrats: “I was trying to be the mom.”</p>",

She was ultimately brought unconscious to the Lehavim junction in the Negev, where an ambulance took her to the hospital.</p> \n<p>Hayun’s lawyers, Eyal Hadar and Shalom Pinia, said in response that their client had been hired as a ticketer. “As such, he had no responsibility whatsoever for the well-being or safety of the partygoers,” they said, adding that his medical advice was not binding. In light of his role at the event, it is not clear on what basis the prosecution has accused him of manslaughter, they said.</p> \n<p>Pashral’s lawyer said “there is clearly a disagreement regarding the level of responsibility each person held. My client didn’t know nor should he have that someone is in such distress. To accuse him of her tragic death is a legal and moral mistake. We’ll prove his innocence in court.”</p>",

In February Russia vetoed a Western attempt to have the Security Council call out Tehran in a resolution on Yemen.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A 2015 UN resolution &quot;called upon&quot; Iran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Some states argue that the language does not make it obligatory.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The United States wants the council to toughen that measure, Pompeo said, to reflect language in a 2010 resolution that left no room for interpretation by banning Iran from &quot;activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using ballistic missile technology.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The United States, Britain and France have accused Tehran of flouting the current UN restrictions on Tehran's missile program by carrying out ballistic missile launches. Iran says the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Most UN sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in January 2016 when the UN nuclear watchdog confirmed that Tehran fulfilled commitments under a nuclear deal with Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and the United States. But Iran is still subject to a UN arms embargo and other restrictions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The UN sanctions and restrictions on Iran are contained in the 2015 resolution that also enshrines the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from in May. European powers have been scrambling to salvage the deal.</p>",

        "text":["<p>The army ombudsman, Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brik, reiterated his call on Wednesday to set up an independent investigative committee to look into deficiencies in the army. Speaking to a session of the State Control Committee, Brik said the defense establishment was not paying proper attention to criticism and in many instances is not acting to correct deficiencies.</p> \n<p>According to Brik, while some parts of the report he compiled on the subject has been adopted by the military and taken care of, there is a disparity between the reality on the ground and how the senior ranks of the army present the situation to the country’s political leadership.</p> \n<p>“An inferior organizational culture is the core of the problem,” Brik said, adding that if it is not changed, steps taken to rectify specific problems will not work. “Proper attention is not paid to oversight in the defense establishment. How are we going to win wars?” he asked.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli army watchdog paints gloomy picture of readiness for war | Analysis</p> \n<p>Among the specific problems that Brik noted was difficulty in integrating new weaponry, particularly among reserve soldiers, and the use by soldiers and their commanders of smartphones. He also protested the lack of discipline in all ranks and “commanders who do not show up at their hearings when the violate orders.”</p> \n<p>MK Shelly Yacimovich (Zionist Union), who heads the State Control Committee, opened the committee session by recounting that she had come under considerable and “disproportionate” pressure, as she called it, not to hold the session. There were those, she said, who argued that the session “would hurt soldiers’ moral and the strength of the army,” and added: “It appears as if the enemy is Brik and not Hezbollah and Hamas.”</p> \n<p>Brig. Gen. Uri Gordin, the commander of the army’s ground forces, responded to Brik’s criticism, saying facetiously: “I may be mediocre but the brigade commanders are outstanding, and they say they are prepared for war. There are problems. They need to be dealt with. I am in no way ignoring this.” There is major oversight in the army, he asserted, and “over the years, the army has been doing a lot to correct oversight deficiencies.” For instance, he said he’d like to see reserve soldiers practicing more throughout the year.</p> \n<p>In June, when he presented the ombudsman’s annual report at a press conference, Brik went public with criticism of the army’s preparedness for war. The report did not include a direct reference to the state of readiness, but Brik hinted that his criticism was related to training, to training exercises and the state of the weaponry used by the ground forces.</p> \n<p>Since then, he has issued two detailed letters to then-Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman in which he focused mainly on the army’s manpower policies, describing a serious crisis that he said could have implications relating to the capabilities of the entire army — particularly the ground forces — to fight a war. Brik’s latest report is the third on the issue.</p> \n<p>One of Brik’s concerns is that soldiers are buried in their cellphones. Not only does this make meetings and classes less effective, but “soldiers even guard at the border with their phones, and commanders don’t enforce the rules,” he has said in the past. “This is also what will happen in wartime, and the result will be that the units’ location will be in the enemy’s hands.”</p> \n<p>For his part, Gordin invited Brik to tour the units dealing with emergency supplies anywhere in the country, “even tomorrow at 7:30 in the morning.” Yacimovich took up the offer herself, saying that the members of her committee would make such a visit.</p> \n<p>Knesset member Eyal Ben-Reuven (Zionist Union), a reserve major general himself whom once had Brik as his commander, said he holds Brik in high esteem, but then leveled criticism at his former commander. “The public’s confidence in the army is important. I am not against oversight, but there is a limit. You have crossed the line. You have gone from [providing] a major benefit to damaging. You have gone from a fine and respected figure to an unwanted one.”</p> \n<p>MK Ayelet Nahmias-Verbin (Zionist Union) also criticized Brik, saying the confrontation his criticism has caused is harming Israel’s deterrence. MK Merav Ben Ari (Kulanu) said to Brik: “You’ve put me in a situation where if I’m with you I’m against them [the military].”</p> \n<p>However, Nahmias-Verbin, Ben Ari and MK Eitan Cabel (Zionist Union) all praised Brik’s work. Cabel said he “agrees with almost every single word” Brik wrote.</p> \n<p>Brik said in response that he “insists” on everything he’s said. He rejected the claim that talking about these issues harms deterrence, saying “we need to deal with out capabilities, not our image.”</p> \n<p>The army’s comptroller, Brig. Gen. (res.) Ilan Harari, is expected to submit a report to army Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot in the coming days with conclusions following an evaluation by his office made of several army divisions following criticism leveled by Brik.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In the span of just a couple days, Chaim Raice went from never having been on a bobsled to being a contender to represent Israel in the 2022 Winter Olympics. And it all started with a Facebook post.</p> \n<p>Raice, a house builder from Pomona, New York, was browsing the social media site in November when he saw a post saying that the Israeli bobsled team was in need of another athlete to compete in the North American Cup beginning that month.</p> \n<p>He thought it was a joke, but still reached out. Though Raice, 46, had little knowledge of bobsled, he had participated in several other sports as an amateur, and his Israeli citizenship meant he qualified to compete for the country.</p> \n<p>It turned out to be a perfect match, and just two days after having reached out, Raice was driving up to Lake Placid to compete.</p> \n<p>“I was kind of shocked that it actually worked out,” he told JTA last week.</p> \n<p>Raice had been told that he would be teaming up with an athlete whose partner had dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The other competitor would serve as the pilot, sitting at the front of the racing sled and steering, while Raice would be the brakeman, pulling a lever to get the go-kart-like sleigh to slow after crossing the finish line.</p> \n<p>What he didn’t know was that his partner, Dave Nicholls, uses a wheelchair to get around. Though Nicholls had been participating in the sport for 14 years, this was the first time the disabled athlete would taking part in a competition for able-bodied people (rather than a para-athlete competition).</p> \n<p>“I was a little shocked,” Raice said about finding out about Nicholl’s status.</p> \n<p>The rules of bobsled, which has two- and four-person teams, actually make competing for wheelchair users less of a challenge than in most other sports. Team members typically push the sled and then jump in before going down the track, but the rules allow an athlete to start seated and the other team members to push — less of a disadvantage in the four-person sled than in pairs.</p> \n<p>Nicholls, who sustained spinal damage in a skiing accident 15 years ago, says it is the first time in the history of the sport that a disabled person competes against able-bodied athletes. JTA reached out to the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation to confirm the claim, but the organization did not respond by publication time.</p> \n<p>Raice arrived in Lake Placid on November 29, just a day before the two-day competition. He and Nicholls, who is in his 50s and based in Park City, Utah, were able to practice on the racetrack twice before the big day.</p> \n<p>Prior to the first day’s run, Nicholls made what he calls “a rookie mistake”: He loosened his helmet strap, causing it to slide down over his eyes and block his line of vision on the track. With Nicholls not able to steer properly, the sled flipped on its side. He broke several fingers, and the team could not complete the race.</p> \n<p>However, it didn’t stop the pair from competing the following day.&nbsp;They finished in 11th place, ahead of two teams that were unable to complete the race. But Nicholls will still participate in additional races as he tries to qualify for the World Cup, a prerequisite for the Olympics.</p> \n<p>With seven athletes, the Israeli bobsled and skeleton team has a record number of members. Though the team is based in the United States, all the athletes have Israeli citizenship — some from birth, others from making aliyah to compete for the country.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, an Israeli sledder competed for the first time in the Olympics,&nbsp;with American-Israeli A.J. Edelman representing the country in one-person men’s skeleton. David Greaves, who leads the team as head of the Israeli Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, hopes that in 2022, the team will not only compete in men’s skeleton but in the women’s race and bobsled.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of small countries that are involved in these sports who struggle every year to find athletes to compete,” said Greaves, who is based in Winnipeg, Canada. “And we have done something in terms of growing our program that most small nations have not been able to do successfully.”</p> \n<p>Raice said that competing for the first time was “way more bone jarring and exhausting than I ever imagined.”</p> \n<p>“You think you’re getting into a sled and slide down,” he said, “but it’s a really fast track and the G-forces are unreal. You feel like you almost get blackout on some of the curves.”</p> \n<p>Still, he said he has become “slightly addicted” to the sport and hopes to continue with the goal of participating in the Olympics together with Nicholls. For his part, Nicholls says that representing the Jewish state holds a special significance.</p> \n<p>“I’m wearing the Star of David when I compete,” he said. “I’m wearing on my left hand a blue and white glove, and on my right hand a USA red, white and blue glove. People know now that I’m Team Israel, and it’s great to hear that over the loudspeaker when they’re announcing the different drivers and the different countries.”</p>",

But it’s balanced by the importance of Saudi Arabia and the role it plays in the Middle East,&quot; Netanyahu told foreign reporters at an event in Jerusalem. &quot;Because if Saudi Arabia would be destabilized, the world, not the Middle East, will be destabilized,&quot; Netanyahu said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Riyadh and a columnist for the Washington Post, disappeared on October 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain marriage documents.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu's response was similar to comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump&nbsp;during an interview to Reuters. &quot;I really hope that people aren't going to suggest that we should not take hundreds of billions of dollars that they're going to siphon off to Russia and to China, primarily those two, instead of giving it to us,&quot; he said, while discussing the murder of Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>&quot;You're talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs.

After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh later said Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed.</p> \n<p>The kingdom has come under scrutiny as details of his killing came to light. Making some of their strongest accusations so far, both U.S. Republicans and Democrats said last week they want to pass legislation to send a message to Saudi Arabia that the United States condemns the death of Khashoggi.</p> \n<p>Reuters contributed to this report.</p>",

Our target is never U.S. soldiers,&quot; Erdogan said at a speech at a defence industry summit in Ankara.&nbsp; &quot;This step will allow for the path to a political solution to be opened and for healthier cooperation.&quot;</p> \n<p>Turkey has repeatedly voiced frustration about what it says are delays in the implementation of the Manbij deal, saying last month that the agreement should be fully carried out by the end of this year.</p> \n<p>Turkish and U.S. troops began joint patrols near Manbij last month, but that cooperation has also been complicated as Turkey has shelled Kurdish fighters to the east of the Euphrates.</p> \n<p>A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Erdogan's comments had created concern in the Pentagon that the fight against Islamic State militants could be affected.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The official said there was concern that a Turkish operation could distract Kurdish YPG fighters away from the middle Euphrates River Valley.&nbsp; In March, another Turkish offensive against the YPG affected the fight against Islamic State and led to an &quot;operational pause&quot; in eastern Syria. The Pentagon says it has about 2,000 troops in Syria.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Last month the United States said would establish observation posts on the border between Kurdish-held northern Syria and Turkey after Turkish cross-border shelling killed four Kurdish fighters.</p> \n<p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said the Turkish attacks had led to a temporary halt in the U.S.-backed campaign the SDF are waging against Islamic State near the Syria-Iraq border.</p> \n<p>Three observation posts have now been set up, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday. The official said the positions were clearly marked and any force attacking them &quot;would definitely know they are attacking the United States&quot;.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Erdogan's announcement came after Turkish officials held talks in Ankara this week with the U.S. special representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey. An SDF military source said Jeffrey met the SDF leadership in northern Syria on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Erdogan said Turkey was the victim of a &quot;stalling tactic&quot; over Manbij and Islamic State no longer posed a threat in Syria.&nbsp;&quot;Now, it's time to realise our decision to disperse the circles of terror east of the Euphrates. The fact that we have deep differences in perception with the United States is no secret,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;A stalling tactic has been used in Manbij and is still being used... There is no threat named Daesh in Syria anymore. This is a fairytale,&quot; he said, using an Arabic acronym for the militant group.</p> \n<p>The YPG still controls a large swathe of northeast Syria, on Turkey's southern border. Turkey regards the YPG as an extension of the PKK. More than 40,000 people, mostly Kurds, have died in the PKK's conflict with Ankara. Turkish authorities fear the conflict could be stoked by the YPG presence across the border.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight for her job in a leadership challenge on Wednesday triggered by Conservative lawmakers, saying a change could jeopardize Britain's divorce from the European Union.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave on March 29, Brexit is plunged into chaos with options ranging from a potentially disorderly no-deal departure to another referendum that could reverse it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Speaking outside her Downing Street residence hours before the vote of confidence on her leadership, May said she would battle for her premiership with everything she had.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In a stark warning to Brexit-supporting opponents who instigated the challenge, May said if they toppled her then the EU exit would be delayed and perhaps even stopped.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>May, who is boxed in on her options for Brexit, had her room for manoeuvre further diminished when she was briefly locked in her car in front of German leader Angela Merkel on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Staff struggled with the door of a limousine bedecked in Britain's Union Flag for more than 10 seconds before eventually opening it and allowing May to leave and shake the hand of Merkel who was waiting for her on a red carpet in Berlin.</p> \n<p>A new leader would not have time to renegotiate a deal with the EU and secure parliamentary approval by the end of March, meaning the Article 50 withdrawal notice would have to be extended or rescinded, she said.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;A change of leadership in the Conservative Party now would put our country's future at risk and create uncertainty when we can least afford it,&quot; she said. &quot;Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A secret ballot will be held between 1800 and 2000 GMT on Wednesday in a room at the House of Commons, and an announcement made at 2100. Before the vote, May will speak to lawmakers at a closed meeting.&nbsp; According to the rules, May could be toppled if a simple majority of Conservative lawmakers vote against her, though a significant rebellion could also undermine her position. At least 120 Conservative lawmakers had expressed public support for her by 11:20 GMT.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brexit is Britain's most significant political and economic decision since World War Two though pro-Europeans fear it will weaken the West as it grapples with the presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The outcome will shape Britain's $2.8 trillion economy, have far reaching consequences for the unity of the United Kingdom, and determine whether London can keep its place as one of the top two global financial centres.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The British pound, which has lost 25 cents against the U.S. dollar since the 2016 referendum, fell on the confidence vote but then rose to 1.2533 on news that Brexit might have to be delayed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>'She must go'</p> \n<p>May, a 62-year-old vicar's daughter who voted to remain in the EU, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum but promised to implement Brexit, while keeping close ties to the bloc, as a way to heal a divided nation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Widely praised for a punishing work ethic and a dutiful approach to solving the Brexit divide, May's premiership has been characterised by obduracy in the face of frequent crises.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Ever since formally triggering the Brexit divorce in March 2017, May has tried to find a way to keep Britain closely aligned with the EU after its exit - the essence of the divorce deal struck with Brussels last month.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But on Monday she abruptly pulled a parliamentary vote on her deal in the face of ridicule from lawmakers and a probable rout. She then rushed to Europe to seek assurances from EU leaders about the deal.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The EU has insisted it will not renegotiate but some of the bloc's leaders have suggested Britain could still change its mind on leaving.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Brexit-supporting lawmakers in her party have accused May of betraying the people's vote in negotiations while opponents say she struck a deal that is the worst of all worlds - out of the EU but with no say over many rules it has to abide by.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;Theresa May's plan would bring down the government if carried forward,&quot; lawmakers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker said in a statement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;But our Party will rightly not tolerate it. Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May's leadership. In the national interest, she must go.&quot;</p> \n<p>'Schism in the U.K.'&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A schism over Europe in the Conservative Party over Britain's relationship with the EU contributed to the fall of all three previous Conservative premiers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.</p> \n<p>Cameron bet all on a referendum he lost in 2016.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Now, May - whose personal standing was already weakened by a snap election last year which cost her a parliamentary majority - also sees her own fate at risk over Europe.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Senior ministers including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid expressed support for her. They warned that changing leader at such an important moment in British history was folly.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>But as investors and company bosses tried to gauge the ultimate outcome of the political crisis, some were betting that Brexit would be thwarted.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The EU's top court ruled on Monday that Britain could cancel its Article 50 notice to leave without permission from other members and without losing special privileges.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Both May's ruling Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party are publicly committed to carrying out Brexit.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>A no-deal Brexit, though, is seen as so disruptive to trade and the economy that parliament would be under pressure to block it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&quot;I am backing the prime minister 100 percent,&quot; said Gove, the most senior Brexiteer in May's government. &quot;She is battling hard for our country and no one is better placed to ensure we deliver on the British people's decision to leave the EU.&quot;&nbsp;</p>",

Her husband, Amichai, who was also wounded in the attack, is in stable condition.

We are embracing you and won't calm down until we cut terror at the root.&quot;</p> \n<p>The baby is expected to buried later Wednesday evening at Jerusalem's Mount of Olives.</p> \n<p>An IDF force stationed nearby fired at the vehicle before the driver fled the scene.

Residents also reported that the IDF is searching in the nearby village of Ein Yabrud, just west of Ofra. The troops collected security cameras located in the village.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Following the attack, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to legalize Ofra. According to Shaked, she has obtained a draft of a legal opinion on the matter. &quot;Facing the price tag of Abu Mazen [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas], we pose our own price tag,&quot; Shaked tweeted. &quot;Every terror attack will strengthen the settlement establishment instead of weakening it, and every potential attacker will know in advance that he will be considered responsible for strengthening settlements.&quot;</p>",

The two terms will run simultaneously. The judge set March 6 for Cohen's voluntary surrender.</p> \n<p>Cohen pleaded guilty to the campaign finance charge in August and to making false statements in November.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;From Khashoggi to impeachment: Highlights from Trump's oval office interview with Reuters</p> \n<p>Cohen, 52, had walked into court on Wednesday morning with his wife, son and daughter, amid a crowd of photographers and reporters.</p> \n<p>Federal prosecutors in New York charged that Cohen, just before the November 2016 election, paid adult film actress Stormy Daniels $130,000 and helped arrange a $150,000 payment to former Playboy model Karen McDougal so the women would keep quiet about their past relationships with Trump, who is married. Trump denies having the affairs.</p> \n<p>Prosecutors have said the payments violated campaign finance laws. Cohen told prosecutors the payments were directed by Trump, implicating the president in a possible campaign finance law violation.&nbsp;Federal law requires that the contribution of &quot;anything of value&quot; to a campaign must be disclosed, and an individual donation cannot exceed $2,700.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cohen faced sentencing on a separate charge of lying to Congress brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election and possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Moscow. Cohen pleaded guilty to that charge last month.</p> \n<p>&quot;He came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in the country,&quot; one of Cohen's lawyers, Guy Petrillo, told the court on Wednesday, arguing for leniency. Cohen cooperated knowing &quot;the president might shut down&quot; Mueller's investigation, Petrillo said.</p> \n<p>Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and has accused Mueller's team of pressuring his former aides to lie about him, his campaign and his business dealings. Russia has denied U.S. allegations of interfering in the election to help Trump.&nbsp;</p>",

        "text":["<p>The state was ordered by a Jerusalem Court Wednesday to pay several thousand shekels in compensation for false arrest to Issa Amro, a well-known Palestinian activist in the West Bank town of Hebron. He had sued the state after being detained in Hebron in 2015 while conducting a tour of the city.</p> \n<p>Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court Registrar Samih Saber Masarwa ruled that Amro’s arrest had been unlawful and awarded him 5,500 shekels ($1,470) in damages. Amro had demanded 40,000 shekels in compensation.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>In the incident, Amro was standing with a group of people on Shuhada Street, the main street leading to the Tomb of the Patriarchs, when, at the request of Israeli soldiers, he moved to nearby stairs rather than standing in the street. The soldiers were concerned that his presence on the street, near the city’s Jewish enclave, could cause friction.</p> \n<p>Amro was then asked to leave the area altogether, but refused. He said that he lived in the area and presented an ID card with his address.</p> \n<p>After refusing, Amro was arrested and taken to a police station, where he waited several hours to be questioned. He was then released.</p> \n<p>The court rejected the state’s argument that the soldiers had the authority to order Amro to leave the area “because to the best of their judgment, it would contribute to calm,” as the state put it.</p> \n<p>In ruling in Amro’s favor, the court registrar said the soldier’s judgment is always subject to review, and although there were grounds to require Amro to move to the stairs and to wait there, there was no basis for requiring that he leave the area entirely.</p> \n<p>The registrar also criticized the police for putting him under formal arrest, although she also questioned the necessity of detaining Amro at all. And if the aim was to separate Amro from Israelis at the scene, the opposite was achieved, the registrar said, because following his arrest, Amro was brought back to Shuhada Street by the soldiers.</p> \n<p>In addition to awarding Amro 5,500 shekels in compensation for what she found was four hours under arrest or detention, she awarded him 1,300 shekels in expenses and 3,500 shekels in attorney’s fees.</p> \n<p>Amro’s lawyers, Eitay Mack and Gaby Lasky, said that in effect, the court had accepted Amro’s claim that he, like other anti-occupation activists, was detained without justification in an attempt to deter him from his activities.</p> \n<p>Lasky said that a criminal case is pending against Amro in military court for participating in demonstrations that she claimed involved similar circumstances.</p> \n<p>“I hope that the court there also understands that the purpose of the detentions against him is to silence him,” she said.</p>",

Demonstrations are planned for Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Be’er Sheva and Rishon Letzion.</p> \n<p>Dozens of unions, schools, and businesses all over the country have announced they will participate in the protest. “Every day that passes without the budgets passing is another day in which a woman could be murdered,” the protest leaders said in a statement. “This is a state of emergency and we won’t stop until our demands are fulfilled.”</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;After the national protest against femicide, women in Israel can dream&nbsp;| Opinion&nbsp;■&nbsp;Arab voices raised as local Israeli authorities join nation-wide women's strike to protest violence&nbsp;■&nbsp;Arab feminists in Israel refuse to let the struggle fade</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, following the previous day’s death of Iman Ahmed Awad of Acre, whose husband is suspected of having murdered her, there were protests in various locations. About 30 people protested at the government precinct junction in Tel Aviv, where some tried to burn tires. Two women were arrested. Ten protesters disrupted traffic at the western entrance to Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>There was also a hearing Wednesday by the Knesset’s Constitution, Law and Justice Committee on a government bill it is preparing to change the legal status of crimes that cause death. Although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called last week to increase the punishments for men who batter their wives or girlfriends – saying, “I view violence against women as terror in every way” – the Justice Ministry told the MKs that it opposes a compulsory life sentence for men who kill their partners.</p> \n<p>During the hearing there was a fierce argument between those MKs who support this change and the Justice Ministry representatives. The ministry, however, believes it would be an error to insert a gender-based criterion into the law, because the law must be equitable. “Most murder victims in the country are men,” noted attorney Tamar Borenstein, representing the ministry. “The question is whether the murder of a woman is more serious than other murders.”</p> \n<p>Under the government bill, the most serious homicide, which would carry an automatic life sentence, would be murder under aggravated circumstances. This category would include terror killings as well as “family honor” killings, which take place mainly in Arab society.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israel Electric near NIS 400m settlement with European&nbsp; firms over cartel allegations</p> \n<p>Israel Electric Corporation is expected to receive 400 million shekels ($107 million) in a settlement arising from a lawsuit filed by the state-owned utility against Siemens, Alstom and ABB. The payment, which is subject to the approval of all the parties, would end IEC’s claim that the three European companies operated a cartel that coordinated prices and prevented competitive bidding in Europe and Israel. The allegations were based on a 2007 European Commission finding that resulted in a 750.7 million euro ($803 million) fine. Israel’s Antitrust Authority concluded that the cartel operated in Israel as well but IEC had trouble proving that claim and its claim that the cartel caused 3 billion shekels in damages, as the suit argued. The three companies rejected the allegations and said any damage the cartel caused were minor. In the past IEC has said that any damages it collects will be passed on to customers.

The deadline to close the deal was set for Thursday, but Ben-Moshe told Africa Israel bondholders he had yet to receive antitrust clearance from several European countries, including Romania. Under the terms of the bailout agreement, Ben-Moshe is supposed to transfer 1.5 billion shekels ($400 million) in cash to bondholders, but to date he has succeeded in raising just 280 million in the market. One source, however, said he was confident Ben-Moshe would raise the capital. “Ben-Moshe is playing poker with the capital market over interest rates. It’s clear that he will close a deal but he is arguing with institutions over the interest rate,” he said. Bondholders will vote Thursday on whether to grant an extension and whether to impose penalties for the delay.

        "text":["<p>WASHINGTON – There is a growing level of support among Americans for a “one-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as long as such a solution ensures equal rights and full citizenship to Palestinians, a new poll released on Tuesday suggests.</p> \n<p>In the context of what a one-state solution would look like, a vast majority of the poll’s respondents said if they had to choose between Israel remaining a Jewish state or a democratic one, they would rather see it remain democratic.</p> \n<p>The poll, conducted by the University of Maryland, included interviews with over 2,300 Americans, who were asked about different issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Besides showing increased support for giving Palestinians full and equal rights, even if that means the end of Israel’s Jewish character, it also showed a similar trend to many previous polls when it comes to how young Americans view Israel. Younger respondents were overwhelmingly less supportive of Israel than those over 35.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;U.S. Jewish groups say they support a two-state solution. So why are they so quiet while Trump dismantles it? | Opinion&nbsp;</p> \n<p>One of the key questions in the poll read: “As you may know, the United States has been acting as a mediator between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, with the aim of reaching an agreement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Whether or not these efforts succeed, there is a question about what kind of future for Israel and the Palestinians the U.S. should be supporting over the long term, and many analysts feel that time is running out for some options. Here are four possible approaches that are frequently discussed. Please select the one you think the U.S. should support.”</p> \n<p>The respondents were then presented with four options in a randomized order. Some 36 percent chose a two-state solution with “Israel and Palestine living side by side” based on the pre-1967 borders.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, 35 percent of Americans chose the one-state solution, described as “a single democratic state in which both Jews and Arabs are full and equal citizens, covering all of what is now Israel and the Palestinian Territories.”</p> \n<p>It should be noted that the one-state solution option was supported by 33 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats. At the same time, 48 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of Republicans said they preferred the two-state solution.</p> \n<p>In recent years, the Israeli right has been calling for annexation of the West Bank, without giving full and equal citizenship to the Palestinians living in that area. According to the poll, only 8 percent of Americans support such an idea. Even among Republican respondents to the poll, only 14 percent expressed support for this idea.</p> \n<p>An additional 11 percent of the respondents said they support the current situation, in which Israel hasn’t annexed the West Bank but also hasn’t given citizenship and equal rights to the Palestinians living in those territories.</p> \n<p>Next, the respondents were asked: “Which of the following statements is closer to your view if a two-state solution is not an option?” Some 64 percent of respondents supported the option that read: “I favor Israel’s democracy more than its Jewishness. I support a single democratic state in which Arabs and Jews are equal even if that means Israel would no longer be a politically Jewish state.”</p> \n<p>Only 26 percent supported the other statement, which expressed support for Israeli annexation without giving Palestinians full and equal rights. In other words, almost two-thirds of Americans prefer a solution that would end Israel’s Jewish majority in the event that a two-state solution is impossible to achieve, and only a quarter would prefer a solution that turns Israel into an undemocratic country where millions of people are not allowed civil and voting rights.</p> \n<p>Prof. Shibley Telhami, who oversees the polling project on American attitudes toward the Middle East at Maryland University, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine on Tuesday that the poll’s results show that many Americans agree with the positions expressed two weeks ago by the writer Marc Lamont Hill, who called to create one state with equal citizenship in place of the current situation. Hill was fired by CNN for his use of the phrase “a free Palestine from the river to the sea,” which is historically affiliated with Palestinian armed and terror groups.</p> \n<p>Telhami wrote that the new poll “indicates that many aspects of Hill’s views are widely shared among the American public – and that these views are not reflective of anti-Semitic attitudes, or even of hostility toward Israel as such. On these issues, there is a gap between the mainstream media and U.S. politicians on the one hand, and the American public on the other.”</p> \n<p>Telhami added: “When one considers that many Israelis and Palestinians, as well as many Middle East experts, already believe that a two-state solution is no longer possible, especially given the large expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, it’s not hard to see why more people would be drawn to a one-state solution.”</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israelis face big jumps in their electricity and water bills starting next month. In the case of electricity, it turns out that the bill could be even higher that the Electricity Authority has said it will be.</p> \n<p>At the start of the month, the agency said energy rates would be rising a sharp 6% in January, subject to public hearings. That set off a firestorm of protests. But research by Nadav Olgan, a partner at the Tel Aviv law firm of Erdinast, Ben Nathan, Toledano &amp; Co., showed that the authority’s figure was far too modest.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>The authority is adopting a new method for calculating electricity bills, which splits the monthly charge into actual power usage and a fixed fee for the cost of connecting a home or business to the electricity grid.</p> \n<p>The new system is designed to ensure that all customers — including households and businesses that are not currently using electricity from the grid, either because the properties are not in use or are using alternative energy sources — are helping to cover the network’s infrastructure costs.</p> \n<p>What Olgan found was that between the two components, electricity rates will rise more steeply than the authority originally estimated. However, how much is still subject to dispute.</p> \n<p>In a revised estimate released Tuesday, the Electivity Authority said rates would rise by 6.5% to 6.9% for users with single-phase electricity and 8.1% for those using 3-phase electricity.</p> \n<p>Olgan, however, said that it still an underestimate. “Because the tariff is being separated into two components (fixed and variable), rates won’t be rising at the 6% rate the authority announced, to 49 agorot (13 cents) per kilowatt-hour, but rather by between 7.5% and 10%,” he said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, the authority refused to own up to any error. Rather, it said its original announcement referred only to the official rise of the tariff, without taking into account the new formula for calculating it.</p> \n<p>The Manufacturers Association of Israel trade group said the rate hike was excessive and that the infrastructure component should be adjusted to make the overall rise more reasonable.</p> \n<p>“The business sector is vehemently opposed to the rate rise and is demanding that the authority raise the rate is a responsible and measured way, It needs to spread out the planned increase in power rates over several years,” said the president of the organization, Shraga Brosh.</p> \n<p>As if all that were not enough, on Wednesday the Water Authority said that water rates would go up 4.56% from January. That was higher than the 3.25% increase the authority had originally estimated would be imposed.</p> \n<p>The increase is due to the fact that Israel is buying an additional 70 million cubic meters of costly desalinated water, the consequence of a five-year drought Israel has experienced. In addition, the authority said, the water and sewage system needs to expanded population growth and a surfeit of new housing projects.</p> \n<p>The water hike quickly elicited a protest from the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce, which estimated its members would be paying an extra 81 million shekels in water costs annually.</p> \n<p>“Slowly its becoming clear that higher prices for consumer goods and the rising cost of living isn’t the fault of the business sector but the inability of the government to fight price increases originating in state-owned monopolies,” said the organization’s president, Uriel Lynn.</p> \n<p>In fact, business have been raising prices for four months. Food manufacturer Osem announced Tuesday that it would raise prices for about a third of its products by 2% to 4.5% at the start of next year. That incluees popular products such as the Bamba peanut snack, ketchup and powdered soups.</p> \n<p>Tnuva, Israel’s biggest maker of dairy products, said it would raise prices for the first time since the social-justice protests of 2011. Citing a rise in the cost of raw milk, the company said prices for many of its products not subject to price controls would rise an average of 2.2%. Other dairy manufacturers have followed suit.</p>",

Gen. Gadi Eisenkot at the IDF's headquarters in Tel Aviv.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu said Hezbollah's intention was to infiltrate into Israeli territory, with the single purpose &quot;to attack and murder innocent Israeli men, women and children.&quot;&nbsp;The prime minister added that the tunnels are &quot;part of a broader regional operation led by Iran.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Israel robs Hezbollah of major offensive asset&nbsp;■&nbsp;Explained:&nbsp;Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels</p> \n<p>&quot;This tunnel will not achieve its goal, and the same goes for the rest of the terror tunnels,&quot; Netanyahu declared. &quot;We neutralized numerous terror tunnels from Gaza and we will complete the work there too. For years, Hezbollah and Hamas spent enormous sums in building the tunnels. We are dismantling this weapon.&quot;</p> \n<p>Netanyahu thanked Eisenkot and former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, adding: &quot;The members of the security cabinet were full partners in the decision, they are being updated all the time.&quot;</p> \n<p>Eisenkot estimated the operation would last several weeks, saying it initiated &quot;before the tunnel threat became direct and immediate for residents of the north and Israeli army bases.&quot;</p> \n<p>He added that the Israeli army possesses the plans for Hezbollah's &quot;defensive measures and residents of the north can feel safe. We spoke to regional council and municipality heads before the operation began. I told them to continue as usual.&quot;</p> \n<p>The Israeli military launched the operation, dubbed Northern Shield, on Monday night. Netanyahu said earlier Tuesday that there had already been &quot;operational successes&quot; in the operation. &quot;Whoever tries to harm the State of Israel will pay a heavy price,&quot; Netanyahu said in a statement, adding that Israel &quot;is operating decisively and responsibly on all fronts simultaneously. We will continue with further actions – public and clandestine – in order to safeguard the security of Israel.&quot;</p> \n<p>The development came hours after Netanyahu met U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Brussels, Belgium on Monday evening. The two discussed ways to &quot;work together to block Iranian agression in the region - in Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon.&quot; The heads of the Mossad and the National Security Council, as well as Netanyahu's military secretary, also attended the meeting.</p> \n<p>The military said it has been aware since 2006 that Hezbollah was trying to construct attack tunnels stretching from Lebanon into Israel at several points along the border. Since then, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has spoken of a plan to take over parts of the Galilee, in northern Israel, in a future conflict. Nasrallah is expected to give a speech in Lebanon on Tuesday evening in response to the launch of the operation.</p> \n<p>The military said it was assessing the situation to gauge Hezbollah's possible reaction to the destruction of the tunnels. The army warned farmers not to approach the border.</p> \n<p>The construction of the tunnels is a violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 Second Lebanon War, IDF Spokesperson Ronen Manelis told Army Radio Tuesday. &quot;We've been preparing for this morning for a very long time,&quot; Manelis said.</p> \n<p>&quot;I don't want to talk about the number [of tunnels], those details will stay classified,&quot; said Manelis, &quot;It suffices to say that it is a small number. Work has started near Metullah, and in the coming days the operation will expand to other sections of the homefront.&quot;</p> \n<p>Manelis added that the tunnels did not constitute an immediate threat and they were still unfinished.</p> \n<p>New perspective to political crisis</p> \n<p>The revelation of Operation Northern Shield brings new perspective to the security cabinet debates surrounding the cease-fire with Hamas in Gaza. Now we can say that the tunnels in the north were among the considerations in the security cabinet meeting where the ministers decided not to launch a full-scale operation in Gaza following a botched Israeli military operation there and the firing of some 500 rockets from Gaza at Israel.</p> \n<p>Most of the ministers had agreed, in accordance with the defense establishment's position, that an offensive in Gaza was not appropriate at the time, out of fear of escalation on two fronts. Lieberman, who resigned his post as defense minister following the cease-fire announcement, disagreed with the assessment that the northern front required immediate action. He insisted that the situation in Gaza was more pressing.</p> \n<p>Several ministers have criticized Netanyahu for using classified information about the tunnels and the operation to justify delaying elections. According to them, the level of the threat did not justify a delay in dissolving the coalition.</p> \n<p>Since the revelation of the operation on Tuesday, most of the ministers support the decision for a cease-fire in Gaza. The prime minister's bureau instructed ministers not to give interviews for fear of complicating the situation with Hezbollah. When Netanyahu spoke of security threats that he could not disclose in November, it can be assumed that the northern front was one of the threats.</p>",

But when Israel’s government undertook to gradually reduce tariffs on canned tuna, it had good reason to celebrate a small victory in its campaign to bring down the cost of living.</p> \n<p>A two-year process that had eliminated a duty of 3.51 shekels (94 cents) on each kilogram of tuna, leaving just a 12% duty, had brought down the price to shoppers 14.5%.</p> \n<p>To really understand Israel and the Middle East - subscribe to Haaretz</p> \n<p>As it turns out, however, even that small achievement didn’t withstand the anti-competitive forces of the Israeli market: Two years later the price of a 160-gram can of the fish is even higher than when the tariff cuts started.</p> \n<p>According to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics, it averaged 7.50 shekels for a can in October 2013, fell to 6.90 when the treasury was lauding its achievement and, as of October 2018, was up to 7.80 shekels.</p> \n<p>What happened? The treasury chief economist didn’t deny that when prices had fallen in 2016 it was because the price of raw tuna internationally had fallen. However, he argued that without the tariff reduction, falling tuna prices would never have been passed on to the Israeli consumer.</p> \n<p>But a cursory examination of raw tuna prices in subsequent years doesn’t bear that out. The price was $1,400 a ton in October 2016, shot up to $2,300 a year later but was back to $1,400 in November 2018. But the tuna reached the Israeli supermarket shelf was constantly rising.</p> \n<p>The industry’s response is that it takes time for changes in the global price to feed through into Israel.</p> \n<p>Shraga Brosh, the president of the Israel Manufacturers Association, blames faulty government policy for the failure of tariff cuts to lower prices – not just for canned tuna but for a host of products.</p> \n<p>“Israel chose to reduce tariffs from countries with whom we have no trade agreements, which was an unprofessional decision, unproven and a dangerous experiment with the Israeli economy that was taken despite warnings by manufacturers,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Today we can declare the experiment a complete failure, as we had warned the government. The price of tuna didn’t fall, but canners were forced to close their factories in Israel and moved to import tuna and can it overseas,” Brosh said.</p> \n<p>He doesn’t blame importers or retailers for high prices, but it’s hard not to point the figure at them. There are no major barriers to importing tuna and a number of companies are doing it, but note that StarKist controls 40% of the market.</p> \n<p>That should be reason enough for the antitrust authorities to examine whether the strangling of local production with tariff cuts ended up coming at the cost of real market competition.</p> \n<p>Actually, as Brosh notes, Israel lost twice in the process. Not only didn’t consumers enjoy lower prices for tuna, the local canning industry was forced out of business, laying off hundreds of workers in the process.</p> \n<p>There were once four factories processing imported tuna for the local market, but soon there will be just one – Filtuna in Be’er Sheva. StarKist Israel announced recently it would shut down production and turn its Tirat Hacarmel facility into a logistic center for imported tuna. Eight of its 100 workers are losing their jobs in the process.</p> \n<p>The high tariffs that had originally been imposed on canned tuna to protect those jobs. There’s no other economic case for processing tuna in Israel. The raw tuna has to be imported from Asia and local costs are high and have grown as environmental rules have grown tougher. Even when some factories switched to lower-cost natural gas for fuel, they still couldn’t compete with imports.</p> \n<p>The industry couldn’t even make the case that it was a source for fresh, locally produced food.</p> \n<p>A pity for the workers. As industry lobbyists continually pointed out in their losing fight to stop the tariff cuts, the industry provided jobs (albeit mostly at the minimum wage) to people with little education and in towns in the periphery where there are few jobs. The workers who are being let go have little prospect of finding alternative employment, all the more so because they are older.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, their sacrifice wasn’t for the greater good of the economy, but to increase the profits of importers and retailers.</p>",

        "text":["<p>If Rabbi Dov Haiyun has his way, Haifa will host a first-of-its-kind magic festival this coming Passover.</p> \n<p>It goes well with the theme of the Jewish holiday, he tells his audience – senior staffers at the municipal theater company. After all, Passover is a celebration of the “signs and wonders” God performed during the exodus of the ancient Israelites from Egypt.</p> \n<p>It takes a rabbi, they’re all thinking to themselves.</p> \n<p>This is Haiyun’s first week in office as deputy mayor of Haifa and he’s holding an initial round of meetings with the city’s cultural bigwigs. It’s an opportunity to throw out ideas he himself is the first to concede qualify as wild. “And I urge you to go wild as well,” he tells his interlocutors. “What better time than this?”</p> \n<p>The first non-Orthodox rabbi to ever serve in Israeli local government, Haiyun’s assigned portfolio is arts and culture, with the Haifa Theatre – the oldest municipal theater company in Israel – one of his chief responsibilities. (His new job includes serving as chairman of its board.)</p> \n<p>And the magic festival isn’t the only unconventional idea he has up his sleeve. Haiyun’s dream, he confides to those gathered in the boardroom, is to create an Andalusian orchestra in Haifa, similar to the successful ensemble in Ashdod. In this case, though, it would also include Arab musicians to reflect Haifa’s mixed Jewish-Arab nature.</p> \n<p>He also envisions an annual international conference dedicated to shared society – a way to cash in, he points out, on Haifa’s reputation as a role model in Jewish-Arab coexistence.</p> \n<p>As the meeting draws to a close, and since nobody else has drummed up the courage to address the elephant in the room, Haiyun takes it upon himself to do just that. Pointing to his big bushy beard and the kippa on his head, he says: “I know you’re all wondering if whether having someone like me in this job means everything is going to close down here on Shabbat. So put your fears to rest. Whatever was opened on Shabbat will remain open on Shabbat – and just because I prefer spending Shabbat morning in synagogue doesn’t mean I have less respect for those of you here who prefer spending Shabbat morning at the theater or in a caf&eacute;.</p> \n<p>“And if I happen to be on my way to synagogue and see you walking with a stroller in the direction of a caf&eacute; on a Saturday morning,” he adds, “you can count on me to open the door for you.”</p> \n<p>National sensation</p> \n<p>In October’s municipal elections, challenger Einat Kalisch Rotem won a landslide victory in Haifa, becoming the first woman to ever serve as mayor of a major Israeli city. Haiyun, 56, one of her supporters from the start, headed the left-wing Meretz slate. Under a rotation agreement with the local branch of the Communist Party, he will serve as deputy mayor for half a term – one of five deputy mayors currently serving in Israel’s third largest city.</p> \n<p>Haiyun had previously served as rabbi of Congregation Moriah, one of the country’s oldest Conservative synagogues. During the 10 years he filled the position, he rose to prominence as an activist in local interfaith dialogue efforts.</p> \n<p>Outside of Haifa, though, most Israelis had never of Haiyun until this past summer. But then, the police came knocking at his door at 5:30 A.M. on July 19, and virtually overnight he became a national sensation. His alleged crime: Performing weddings outside the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate.</p> \n<p>Under a law passed in 2013, rabbis conducting traditional Jewish weddings in Israel not sanctioned by the Rabbinate could face jail terms of up to two years. Haiyun’s detention was the first time this law was ever tested. However, after a few hours of questioning, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit ordered police to suspend their investigation.</p> \n<p>The damage had already been done, though. The incident sparked fierce outrage in the Jewish world and was cited as further evidence of the Israeli government’s religious intolerance. (Haiyun helped fan the flames by writing a Facebook post at the police station, in which he declared that “Iran is already here!!!”)</p> \n<p>Having previously toyed with the idea of venturing into politics, Haiyun understood his newfound fame provided an ideal opportunity for him to test the waters. Within a matter of weeks, he announced his decision to run in the municipal elections as head of the Meretz slate in the northern city.</p> \n<p>Haiyun’s name still doesn’t appear outside his office on the fourth floor of Haifa City Hall, but he has already moved some of his prized possessions inside. They’re currently stacked on his desk, waiting to be hung on the walls. There’s a photo of Janusz Korczak – the director of the Warsaw Ghetto orphanage who accompanied his orphans to the Treblinka death camp and who has long served, Haiyun says, as his inspiration and role model. There’s an artsy photograph he took of a canal in Venice, blown up to poster size (Haiyun is a photography enthusiast and says he dreams of holding a public exhibition of his work). And there’s a framed copy of his license to fly ultralight aircraft (another hobby).</p> \n<p>He’s had a varied career, to say the least. Haiyun has authored six volumes of poetry (what better qualification, he says, for his current portfolio in the city?); served as editor of a periodical published by the kibbutz movement; ran his own publishing house; headed a boarding school for children with special needs; and taught classes in Bible and computing to high school students, before embarking on his current religious vocation.</p> \n<p>Born and raised in Netanya, he has lived in Upper Nazareth, Kibbutz Ramat Rachel outside Jerusalem and an urban kibbutz in Beit Shemesh, before moving to Haifa in 2008 to take up his position at Congregation Moriah.</p> \n<p>The son of working class immigrants from Tunisia, Haiyun grew up in what he describes as a “classic” traditional Sephardi home (referring to those descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews who were dispersed across Europe, North Africa and the Americas after the Inquisitions).</p> \n<p>His high school years were spent in a boarding school for gifted boys from disadvantaged backgrounds, and it was there, at age 16, that he committed his first big act of rebellion: He removed his kippa and stopped laying tefillin in the morning.</p> \n<p>He met his future wife, Zehavit, while serving as a counselor at a facility for children from dysfunctional homes, and they married soon after he completed his army service. They have two children – a boy and a girl.</p> \n<p>About 15 years ago, Haiyun enrolled in a new institution that had begun ordaining “secular rabbis” in Israel. Of all places, it was here he discovered that he wasn’t as secular as he had always believed.</p> \n<p>“I suddenly understood that this program wasn’t a good fit for me because I’m just not an atheist,” he says. So the kippa and tefillin went back on and Haiyun decided to continue his rabbinical studies, but in a different place: The Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies, which ordains Conservative rabbis in Israel.</p> \n<p>Until recent years, the Conservative movement – and the Reform movement as well – was largely dominated by English-speaking immigrants to Israel. Although non-Orthodox Judaism is slowly starting to gain a foothold in the country, Conservative rabbis from a background like Haiyun’s are still a rare breed.</p> \n<p>When people ask him how a nice Sephardi boy ended up becoming a Conservative rabbi – and they often do – his response is that they have it all wrong. “The Conservative movement has much more in common with classic Sephardic Judaism than Shas,” he says, referring to the ultra-Orthodox, right-wing political movement that has drawn wide support in recent decades among Sephardi voters. “After all, the Judaism I grew up with was more tolerant and much less rigid – much more like Conservative Judaism.”</p> \n<p>Odd man out</p> \n<p>Rotem’s surprise victory in the recent municipal election has been attributed, among other factors, to her success in drumming up support among the ultra-Orthodox in this city – long a beacon of Israeli secularism. Indeed, Haifa is the only majority-Jewish city in the country where public transportation operates on Shabbat. In exchange for their support in the election, Rotem invited the ultra-Orthodox parties to join her coalition in city hall.</p> \n<p>The first meeting of the newly formed council, held last week, was an unusual gathering, as Haiyun recounts. “I could just see, from the looks on their faces, that the ultra-Orthodox city council members didn’t know what to make of me,” he says. “There I was, wearing a kippa on my head and sporting a beard just like them. I may even have had my tzitzit [a fringed undergarment worn by religious Jewish men] sticking out and, as I often do, I cited some talmudic passages when I spoke,” he relays. “But I’m clearly not one of them – I’m the guy from Meretz.”</p> \n<p>He’s a relative newcomer to the party, though. For many years, Haiyun was a card-carrying member of the much bigger and more centrist Labor Party. He quit about a year ago, though, having reached the conclusion that the party no longer represented his values. The trigger was the resignation of Labor’s only Arab lawmaker, Zouheir Bahloul, from the Knesset and the response this elicited from new party leader Avi Gabbay, who essentially told the Arab MK: “Good riddance.”</p> \n<p>“I wrote a letter to Gabbay explaining my decision to leave the party, but never heard back from him,” says Haiyun.</p> \n<p>Although he describes his politics today as being “on the right side” of Meretz, Haiyun has been known to swing further left as well. In the 1990s, for example, he spent time in prison after refusing to serve in the occupied territories after being called up for reserve duty. “If I found myself in the similar situation today, I would act differently,” he admits.</p> \n<p>Working together</p> \n<p>In addition to photography, poetry and flying, Haiyun’s passions include scuba diving (he’s about to use his remaining vacation days from his rabbinical job to embark on a two-week trip to Mexico to do just that), sailing (he just received his skipper’s license) and running (he recently completed his first half marathon and is in training for his first 26-miler). In his spare time, he continues to officiate at non-Rabbinate-sanctioned weddings.</p> \n<p>Haiyun hopes to use his new position as Haifa’s culture czar to bring much-needed tourism to the city. “The problem today is that people come, they visit the Bahai Gardens – which is the one big must in this city – and then they leave,” he says. “We have a wonderful film festival here every fall, but that’s not enough. There needs to be more going on to get visitors to stick around here.”</p> \n<p>Is he concerned about having to work with Israel’s controversial culture minister, Miri Regev, who has tried to use her budget and authority to suppress criticism of the state? “We’ll have to learn to get along and work together,” he says.</p> \n<p>Working together is clearly one of Haiyun’s mantras. Major fires that broke out in northern Israel in November 2016 left Congregation Moriah – Haifa’s only Conservative synagogue – in virtual ruins. Among those who volunteered to help restore and refurbish the synagogue were some of Haiyun’s Muslim friends and acquaintances. For this joint effort, “Haifa’s Interfaith Heroes,” as they were hailed, received the American Jewish Committee Unity Award last year.</p> \n<p>Haiyun says that, unlike many of his fellow residents, he was not at all surprised when his Muslim neighbors reached out to lend a helping hand.</p> \n<p>“When you sow love,” he says, “you reap love.” It’s a motto that will continue to guide him in his new vocation.</p>",

        "text":["<p>In conjunction with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s independence, Channel 10 broadcast a documentary series by journalist Raviv Drucker about six of the country’s prime ministers. The series dealt with the personality, biography and historical importance of David Ben-Gurion, Levi Eshkol, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Ariel Sharon. The series was done well and it was important because it provided a broad historical and political context and did not avoid asking questions and leveling criticism. It was clear that the series’ consideration of the past originated in the present, in which Israel has been ruled for a lengthy period by Benjamin Netanyahu, whose political career shows no signs of ending anytime soon.</p> \n<p>Drucker’s series did not consist of documentary films but of reports; however, the line that divides documentaries from television reports has long since become blurred, for good and for ill. Some reports are actually short documentaries, and some documentaries seem to be extended reports. The difference lies in the amount of creative thought that’s invested in them.</p> \n<p>Drucker’s series is also important in light of the fact that only a handful of Israeli documentary films have investigated the character of the country’s leaders. A rare example is last year’s “Ben-Gurion, Epilogue,” a film by Yariv Mozer and Yael Perlov. It is based on an interview Ben-Gurion gave in April 1968 at Kibbutz Sde Boker, when he was 82, to a young American, Clinton Bailey, whom the former prime minister chose personally. Mozer and Perlov discovered the interview in the Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem while they were trying to reconstruct the forgotten and ostensibly lost 1969 feature film “42:6,” by the acclaimed documentarist David Perlov (Yael Perlov's father) about Ben-Gurion, which was yanked from movie theaters immediately after its release.</p> \n<p>“Ben-Gurion, Epilogue” was a lovely, moving film that aroused longing – whether justified or not – for a different form of leadership. In it, the “Old Man” sets forth his political worldview a year after the Six-Day War and describes his vision for the future of the state whose establishment he declared. But it’s an almost lone example of a documentary about a local leader.</p> \n<p>American-style politician</p> \n<p>A recent addition to the documentaries about local leaders is Dan Shadur’s “King Bibi.” The film takes its title from the May 28, 2012, cover story of Time magazine (inspired by the name of the blues giant B.B. King). Still, Netanyahu had been declared “king” even earlier (as had others before him) in the rhapsodic cries “Bibi King of Israel” chanted at Likud meetings and demonstrations. Compiled entirely from archival footage, some of which was new to me and amusing as well (particularly from the early part of his career), “King Bibi” aims to portray the way in which Benjamin Netanyahu became Benjamin Netanyahu. Even his detractors find it difficult today to picture the country without Netanyahu as its leader – at least according to the film’s narration, spoken by the actor Alon Aboutboul. Does the film succeed in its aim? Only partially.</p> \n<p>“King Bibi” grounds its narrative – which depicts the transformation undergone by Netanyahu – in two elements, one of which envelops the film, while the other is intimated. The outer casing underscores the fact that Netanyahu grew up in the U.S., where he held his first representational posts and where he learned how to be an American-style politician.</p> \n<p>The narration is businesslike, but mostly unnecessary for an Israeli audience that has experienced the Netanyahu era – though not for a foreign audience, which is possibly the film’s main target. We also hear passages from the doctrine of Lilyan Wilder, a well-known public-speaking coach; Netanyahu was a pupil of hers in the U.S. These segments add an ironic dimension to “King Bibi” by showing how Netanyahu complied obediently with Wilder’s theoretical notions about the effectiveness of rhetoric, though at times in his career he also departed from her instructions.</p> \n<p>Irony is also apparent when Netanyahu, then deputy chief of mission at the Israeli embassy in Washington, faces the cameras in one of his first public appearances, during the 1982 Lebanon War. That was after the Sabra and Shatila massacre, when Israel-U.S. relations were badly strained, and Netanyahu shows up unshaven, with his hair unkempt. That was the last time the public would see him like that, the narration notes. Was it a strategic move, aimed at showing the resilient young sabra caught in a crisis and seeking viewer empathy at a crucial moment?</p> \n<p>As for the intimated element in the film – which could serve as the basis for a melodrama – that concerns Netanyahu’s relationship with his father, the historian Benzion Netanyahu; and his coping with the memory of his brother, Yoni Netanyahu. At the very beginning of the film, even before Netanyahu has realized his leadership aspirations, his father asserts that if Yoni hadn’t been killed at Entebbe he would undoubtedly have become the country’s leader. Is Netanyahu’s story that of a son who tries to please his grim-faced father and whose unbridled ambition stems from his efforts to free himself from the giant shadow cast by his brother’s death? Had the film intimated that these elements helped shape Netanyahu’s development, it could have acquired a measure of depth, which it now lacks.</p> \n<p>Since there is not much that is new in the film, I found its primary interest to lie in being able to follow the way Netanyahu’s face has changed across the decades. It’s not just that time’s passage has left its mark, but the movie reflects the transformation of a young man, a bit embarrassed, hesitant and even shy at the outset, into the Netanyahu we’re familiar with today, arrogant and aggressive. This is clearly a far deeper behavioral, mental and existential metamorphosis.</p> \n<p>Face is everything in cinema, and face – Netanyahu’s face – is also everything in Shadur’s film. However, watching its evolution does not make up for what’s lacking in “King Bibi” – namely ideology. We are witness to the way Netanyahu applies what he learned from the political reality during his time in Washington, but the portrayal of these developments is not utilized to illuminate the political and leadership moves that have made him a figure who is so securely ensconced in power that even to suggest trying to unseat him is considered futile. The film also makes no effort to account for the loyalty and admiration that Netanyahu arouses in his voters. As a result, “King Bibi” feels hollow, and its ideological reticence and ambivalence sometimes lends it the character of a publicity movie.</p> \n<p>There’s one wonderful moment in the film, when Netanyahu and Moshe Katsav – who would become Israel’s president and was later convicted of rape – are sitting side by side along with Yitzhak Rabin and chuckling. It’s a highly charged moment that seems to encompass the entire essence of this land. Netanyahu’s changing face is the face of the country, so it’s a pity that the film doesn’t take the physical portrait it creates for us as the point of departure to articulate a broad theory about that essence. After all, every king has a kingdom.</p> \n<p>&quot;King Bibi.&quot; Written and directed by Dan Shadur; edited by Neta Dvorkis, Dan Shadur; sound design by Itzik Cohen; music by Karni Postel</p>",

        "text":["<p>Here’s the stick. The bereaved brother removes the black plastic that’s wrapped around it reverently, as if it’s a holy relic. It’s a broomstick, stained with his brother’s blood. It’s the stick he was carrying under his arm as he tried to move away from Israel Defense Forces soldiers approaching him on Jaffa Road in downtown Tul Karm, a street of restaurants and caf&eacute;s. He was shot from a distance of about 80 meters; the bullet slammed into his head from behind.</p> \n<p>How can it be claimed that he endangered anyone from that far away?</p> \n<p>The street was relatively quiet. A small number of young people winding up the night at the coffee houses – and about 30 soldiers opposite them. The security camera at one of the restaurants shows 2:24 A.M. From the video provided by that camera and three others along the street, whose footage was obtained by B’Tselem, the Israeli human rights organization, we see no stone throwing, no large groups milling around. What is seen are three soldiers moving forward, ahead of the rest of their unit. One shot is heard from a distance, and another; two soldiers apparently fired simultaneously. The person seen carrying a stick and walking on the other side of the street, away from the approaching soldiers, falls to the ground, face down. For a second he tries to lift his head – before dying. Another young man is hit in the leg. The soldiers leave in a hurry.</p> \n<p>End of operation. End of the short life of Mohammad Khabali, whom everyone here called “Za’atar” affectionately (after the popular seasoning made of wild hyssop). Mentally challenged from birth, he never hurt a soul and helped local caf&eacute; owners clean up at night in return for a free smoke on the narghile; occasionally he would beg for a handout from a passerby. It’s doubtful that the soldier who shot him knew whom he was shooting; it’s even more doubtful that would have cared. He killed Za’atar for no apparent reason and inflicted another disaster on his already unfortunate family, which lives not far away from town in the Tul Karm refugee camp, one of the West Bank’s poorest.</p> \n<p>An intimidating pile of garbage greets visitors at the gates of the refugee camp; workers wearing United Nations shirts are loading refuse onto a garbage truck. The Tul Karm camp is the larger of two refugee camps that abut the city on its eastern side. (The other is Nur a-Shams.) Graffiti of a prisoner in an Israel Prisons Service uniform is painted on a wall, a young man in a wheelchair sits in front of one of the houses, the narrow alleys are also littered with garbage.</p> \n<p>Neglect is pervasive here. Garbage swirls even around the shattered monument commemorating the 157 inhabitants of the camp who were killed until between 1987 and 2003, during the two intifadas. The monument was erected at the site where at least 10 young people were killed in the second intifada by IDF snipers who positioned themselves on the roof of a high building nearby. A new, more up-to-date monument is planned, we’re told by the camp’s director of services, Faisal Salami. A cluttered store selling scraps, second-hand items and old trinkets is bursting at the seams. It seems like all of Israel’s schmattes have ended up here.</p> \n<p>Entering one of the houses, we climb to the second floor: It is the home of the Khabali family and of the camp’s most recent martyr. Exposed electrical cables adorn the walls, on the sink is an old car mirror – the apartment’s only mirror. We will soon be joined by the bereaved father, Khossam Khabali, his legs incapacitated from a childhood disease; he ascends the stairs with great difficulty, leaning on a cane, both legs disfigured. He’s 54 years old and trying in every way possible to provide a living for his nine children, two of whom – the dead son and one of his brothers – have suffered from mental impairment. Khabali works as a guard in the Tul Karm Municipality, hauls fruits and vegetables to the market on a mule-drawn cart, and is an occasional undertaker in the local cemetery. No, he replies, he did not dig his son’s grave.</p> \n<p>His face is a study in grief and suffering. Mona, his wife, a heavyset woman of 50, speaks about her dead son in a whisper. The shock is still palpable here.</p> \n<p>Last Monday, they relate, Mohammad was at home and in good spirits. He helped his father fix the mule cart. For supper he had makluba, a chicken and rice dish that his mother prepared, and at about 7:30 he left for the cafes on Jaffa Road, as he did every evening. Before leaving, he asked his mother if she needed anything.</p> \n<p>He would usually get home around 1 A.M., after straightening and cleaning up the cafes. This time he didn’t return. At about 3 A.M., distraught young men arrived at the house and woke up the eldest son, Ala, who roused his parents: Mohammad had been killed. Khossam asked one of his daughters to check on the camp’s Facebook page whether it was a mistake, and discovered, to his horror, that the victim was indeed his Mohammad. In a daze, he hurried to the Thabet Thabet Hospital in the city, where he saw his son’s body, a hole in the back of his neck. Death had claimed him at age 22.</p> \n<p>Mohammad attended school until sixth grade, but didn’t understand a thing, his parents say. Already at the age of 3 they noticed he wasn’t developing like the other children and was mentally disabled. He was their second son. Their next child, Ibrahim, who’s now 18, suffers from the same affliction. Ten days before Mohammad was killed, he and Khossam returned from Amman, where they paid condolences on the death of Khossam’s brother. It was Mohammad’s first – and last – trip out of the country.</p> \n<p>According to his Aunt Latifa, who came to Tul Karm for the funeral, he was thrilled to be in Amman. Video clips show him dancing and singing at the home of relatives in the Jordanian capital, a day before returning to the refugee camp. There’s also a selfie that Mohammad took. He helped his uncles harvest and sort olives – that too was captured on video and in other photos.</p> \n<p>In the last picture taken of him, Mohammad can be seen holding a small Koran and seemingly reading from it, though he didn’t know how to read or write. That shot was taken in one of the Jaffa Road coffee houses, about an hour and a half before soldiers killed him. Some clips show him speaking, but his speech is slurred, unclear. Allah have mercy, his aunt sighs.</p> \n<p>After father and son returned from Amman, discussions began about the wedding of the eldest, Ala. Mohammad told his parents that he’d like to be the next to get married. Mohammad was never stopped by soldiers, never got into a quarrel with anyone, and appears to have been much loved in the camp and in the city, partly because of his impairment. The narghile was his way of relaxing, his escape.</p> \n<p>After leaving the family with a heavy heart, we drive to the scene of the killing. Tul Karm’s main street for entertainment begins at Kadoorie Technical University, at the city’s western edge, and ascends to the town center: stores, computer game arcades, restaurants, caf&eacute;s – one of which is for women only, its windows blacked out. Some of the places are stylishly designed. There’s Caf&eacute; Bianco, Caf&eacute; Al-Shelal and opposite them a wall painting of Mahmoud Darwish, the Palestinian national poet.</p> \n<p>On the night between Monday and Tuesday of this past week, some 200 soldiers invaded the city, according to residents’ estimates, and scattered to a number of sites. Routine. A group of about 30 soldiers raided two houses just off Jaffa Road and then proceeded to the main street. They didn’t detain anyone. The coffee houses were already mostly closed, the A-Sabah hummus restaurant was about to open to welcome workers who set out to their jobs in Israel in the middle of the night.</p> \n<p>The soldiers gathered next to the Al-Fadilia boys school, the city’s veteran educational institution, at one end of the street. The young people who emerged from the caf&eacute;s exchanged curses with the soldiers, some threw stones at them from a distance. According to Abd al-Karim Sa’adi, a field investigator for B’Tselem, who carefully collected evidence immediately after the killing as though he were from a police forensic unit, including footage from all the security cameras on the street, the stones landed halfway between the young people and the soldiers. No one was hit.</p> \n<p>In Sa’adi’s estimation, no more than 15 or 20 young Palestinians confronted the soldiers, from some distance. One of them told Mohammad, “Za’atar, you should get out of here.” As the video from one camera shows, Za’atar turns around and starts to walk away from the soldiers. Not running but slowly walking. Then he’s shot in the head, from behind.</p> \n<p>In a statement to Haaretz this week, the IDF Spokespersons Unit said, “Last week a Military Police investigation was launched. At this stage it can be noted that during operational activity of Israeli soldiers in Tul Karm, a violent riot erupted and dozens of Palestinians hurled rocks towards the fighters. In response, the soldiers used riot-dispersal means and live fire. It was reported that one Palestinian was killed and another injured [in this incident]. When the army finishes its investigation, the conclusions of the probe will be examined by the military prosecutor. The incident is also being probed at the command level.”&nbsp;</p> \n<p>B’Tselem has released the following statement: “Video footage from four security cameras installed on three separate buildings along the street shows that the area was perfectly quiet and that there were no clashes there with soldiers… The video footage and the eyewitness accounts collected by B’Tselem from people who were near Khabali show no absolutely no of sign of any ‘disturbance,’ stone-throwing or use of crowd control measures. Quite the contrary: the soldiers are seen walking unhurriedly, the Palestinians are seen talking amongst themselves, and then the soldiers fatally shoot Khabali in the head from a considerable distance. The lethal shooting was not preceded by a warning, was not justified and constitutes a violation of the law.”</p> \n<p>A few faded bloodstains are still visible on the asphalt where Khabali’s body was dragged away after the shooting. He died on the spot, his head bleeding profusely, Sa’adi says.</p> \n<p>Fine Italian espresso is served in the caf&eacute; opposite, and two colorful photographs are hanging on the wall. One is of a large drone with the Israel Air Force symbol on its tail, the other of an IAF Fouga early fighter plane in the skies above Israel. The proprietor says he erased the squadron numbers before hanging them. He bought the two pictures in Tul Karm’s flea market.</p> \n<p>Mohammad Khabali, aka “Za’atar,” is now buried not far from here, in the martyrs section of the cemetery.</p>",

        "text":["<p>For Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling elite, there's a hidden, pernicious and conspiring hand that works tirelessly against the Republic of Turkey. Were it not for the connivance of this clandestine network, Turkey would be a global power and leader of nations.</p> \n<p>Who are these sinister conspirators who plot within the murky shadows of international corporations, governments and transnational bodies against the Turkish Republic? You guessed it: Jews. And global bogeyman George Soros is just one of them.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;When the State Sanctions Turkey’s Ugly anti-Semitism&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Textbook Regression: Turkey’s anti-Semitic Onslaught Against Evolution</p> \n<p>On November 21, Erdogan&nbsp;pointed the finger at George Soros for apparently conspiring against the Turkish government.</p> \n<p>He did this by claiming that the Turkish businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala, currently detained and awaiting trial, was working for &quot;the famous Hungarian Jew George Soros.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Erdogan added that Soros &quot;is a man who was assigned to divide nations and shatter them. He has so much money and he is spending it in these ways,&quot; including, apparently, to orchestrate the 2013 Gezi Park protests against government plans to demolish one of Istanbul’s last remain green spaces, and which became a protest against Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In Turkey, anti-Semitic conspiracies are not merely present, they are part and parcel of government ideology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Back in 2013 many Turkish citizens took to the streets to protest the imminent demolition of Gezi Park. Soon, the demonstration morphed into widespread protests that expressed discontent towards Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).</p> \n<p>Instead of recognizing that not all in Turkey were satisfied with the Government’s performance, the then Deputy Prime Minister, Besir Atalay, claimed that&nbsp;the&nbsp;chief orchestrators of the protests were not Turks, but international&nbsp;Jewry. One of Erdogan’s chief advisors was even so brazen as to attack government rivals for &quot;raising soldiers for the Jews.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Baffling economists and political analysts alike, Erdogan accused the Gezi Park protestors of being provocateurs for the &quot;interest rate lobby,&quot; a group whose previous existence was unknown. But as&nbsp;Efrat Aviv notes, in her 2017 book &quot;Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism in Turkey,&quot; an explanation emerged - from a newspaper owned by none other President Erdogan’s son-in-law.</p> \n<p>Who's the despicable group seeking to manipulate Turkey’s interest rates for their own profit, to wreak havoc among Turkey’s economy? A network of Jewish financiers, working in cahoots with Opus Dei and the Illuminati!&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After the Gezi protests, Erdogan named the body responsible for all of Turkey’s ills and difficulties - &quot;The Mastermind.&quot; Several months later,&nbsp;Haber, a pro-government television channel, aired&nbsp;a documentary&nbsp; also called &quot;The Mastermind.&quot;</p> \n<p>With the help of pro-government academics, journalists and other cognoscenti, the documentary explains that Jewish machinations are as ancient as the story of Moses, the descendants of whom, Jews, have sought global dominance for 3,500 years.</p> \n<p>It was they who brought down the Ottoman Empire, forced the demise of Islamist governments, and continue to plot against Turkey, even manipulating the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Since then, Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned&nbsp;&quot;The Mastermind.&quot; Since the explanatory documentary has been aired (several times) by a network sycophantic to him, it's clear that every reference he makes means only one thing: Jews.</p> \n<p>Secret Jewish conspiracies are part in parcel of the ideology from the political environment from which Erdogan and the AKP emerged.</p> \n<p>The Islamic&nbsp;Milli Gorus&nbsp;(National Outlook) movement surfaced during the 1970s. Central to the&nbsp;Milli Gorus ideological perspective is an idiosyncratic type of anti-Semitism which points the accusatory finger at either Jews or&nbsp;Donmes (followers of the 17th century &quot;false messiah&quot; Shabbtai Zvi) for bringing about the demise of the Ottoman Empire and creating a secular society upon its charred remains.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such a movement would have been but a&nbsp;meager&nbsp;footnote in the relentlessly vast history of anti-Semitism, were it not for the rise of the Islamic Welfare Party, a later incantation of the&nbsp;Milli Gorus&nbsp;tradition. Under the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan, an old political bruiser if ever there was one, the party entered government in 1996 with Erbakan as Prime Minister, only to be ousted after a military intervention the following year.</p> \n<p>Erbakan was a rabid anti-Semite of the highest order who liked to rabble rouse about Jewish conspiracies while offering a sprinkle of nasty slurs to top it off. Jews as&nbsp;bacteria, that sort of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Fast forward to today, and is it any wonder that the intellectual inheritors of nonsense passed as knowledge allege that there is a secret Jewish plot against Turkey? And still it continues unabated, and in full force.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Erdogan is on record as making vulgar anti-Semitic slurs (&quot;You are the&nbsp;spawn of Israel!&quot; he told a member of the public who dared to criticize him). He has brazenly stated conspiratorial nonsense such as&nbsp;Jewish capital being behind the&nbsp;New York Times,&nbsp;after the leading daily criticized his anti-democratic practices.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>'Spawn of Israel’: Erdogan's anti-Semitic Obsessions</p> \n<p>He tried to&nbsp;delegitimize the 2017 independence referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan by insinuating the referendum was a result of Jewish duplicity.&nbsp;In Erdogan’s words: &quot;You have the former foreign minister of France [Bernard Kouchner] on one side and another Jew [Bernard-Henri Levy] on another, working at the table together,&quot; while also alleging that the Mossad and the Kurds work&nbsp;hand-in-hand.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Turkey’s current financial crisis, a result of the country’s current account deficit, foreign currency debt, lack of central bank autonomy and the President’s aversion to interest rates, has also been blamed on Jews.</p> \n<p>In August as the Turkish lira tumbled against the dollar, Burhan Kuzu, AKP co-founder and member of parliament until the June elections of this year,&nbsp;commented&nbsp;that it was &quot;Jewish banking families&quot; who were&nbsp;responsible. Erdogan himself said those behind the 2016 attempted coup were the same people responsible for the currency crisis. Who were those people?</p> \n<p>The failed coup of July 2016 was not merely perpetrated by a Gulenist faction among the military. It was, according to supporters of Erdogan, part of a wider Jewish plot.</p> \n<p>They claim that&nbsp;Fetullah Gulen, the Turkish Islamic preacher in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania and Turkey’s public enemy number 1, is actually a Jew, a Karaite Jew in fact&nbsp;says Ersin Ramoglu, a columnist from pro-government newspaper&nbsp;Sabah,&nbsp;echoing Fuat Ugur, another pro-Erdogan journalist.</p> \n<p>Tamer Korkmaz of the pro-government daily&nbsp;Yeni Safak&nbsp;explained that Gulen is part of the Zionist - Crusader alliance which seeks to reduce Turkey to a colony of the West. According to Korkmaz, the venerable Jewish community organization B’nai Brith is in on the plot!&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Such assertions were seconded by other columnists from leading dailies such as&nbsp;Can Kemal Ozer of pro-government&nbsp;Yeni Soz, and AKP parliamentary deputies such as&nbsp;Orhan Deligoz.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>From this perspective, Gulenist activities, the&nbsp;chaos in Syria and even the&nbsp;activities of ISIS, are all machinations of the Jewish &quot;Mastermind&quot;, a ventriloquist puppet master, a Jewish&nbsp;Mephistopheles seeking to bring Turkey down.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Turkish anti-Semitism is a central bedrock of the ideological thinking of President Erdogan, his AKP government and their supporters. Try this easy test: The next time you hear of a negative political or economic development in Turkey, look out for the anti-Semitism. You can't miss it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Dr Simon&nbsp;A.

        "text":["<p>In August 2013, Jawdat Abu Ghurab, a young fisherman from the Gaza Strip, put out to sea. On his way home, about 100 meters from the shore, he saw the figure of a man lying under the water.</p> \n<p>Abu Ghurab dived down to him, but the moment he touched the figure, he realized it was a statue. With the help of family and friends, he managed to drag the 300-kilogram statue to shore.</p> \n<p>The statue of Apollo, the Greek god of the sun and beauty, arrived on the Gaza coast in between the Hamas-Israel wars of 2009 and 2014. It was sculpted during the Hellenistic period, more than 2,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>It briefly made headlines around the world before once again disappearing, this time into the warehouses of Gaza’s Hamas government, which confiscated it about a month after its discovery. Since then, it hasn’t been seen. All that remains of it are a few pictures of the statue lying on a Smurf blanket.</p> \n<p>In May, the Swiss documentary filmmaker Nicolas Wadimoff and his partner, Beatrice Guelpa, came to Gaza to investigate the statue’s origins and its fate. The film they produced, “The Apollo of Gaza,” will be screened on Friday at the Tel Aviv Cinematheque as part of the 48mm Film Festival. The festival is devoted to the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” as Palestinians call their exile and loss of their land to Israel in the 1948 war.</p> \n<p>The documentary raises fascinating questions about both the statue’s origins and its ultimate fate. But in the eyes of the filmmakers and many of the Gaza residents interviewed for the film, the statue and its story are nothing but an allegory for the situation of Gaza and its residents.</p> \n<p>This is the third film Wadimoff has made about Israel and Palestine. The first, “L’Accord,” from 2005, was about the Geneva Initiative, a proposal for an Israeli-Palestinian final-status agreement. The second, “Aisheen” (the Arabic word for “life”), is from 2009. It describes the lives of Gaza residents following the war with Israel that ended in January of that year and the subsequent tightening of Israel’s blockade of the territory.</p> \n<p>Question marks</p> \n<p>In the new film, Wadimoff seems to be trying to avoid dealing directly with the political background to the events he portrays and the situation in Gaza.</p> \n<p>“When I returned to Gaza this time, I felt there was no need to talk about politics; I didn’t feel that I needed to explain,” he said. He and Guelpa aren’t “na&iuml;ve on the political level,” he added; rather, “maybe it is because we know too much about it that we need to look somewhere else in a different manner … if not, it is too hopeless.”</p> \n<p>The film portrays a Gaza that’s completely unfamiliar to Israelis. There are no armed Hamas militants and no pictures of demonstrations, no portrayals of the siege or the distress of Gaza residents.</p> \n<p>Instead, it introduces the viewer to antiquities dealers, art collectors, archaeologists and a group of students who are learning about and are proud of Gaza’s ancient history. All see the statue as offering a chance for a different kind of reality.</p> \n<p>“I love the statue and its story so much that I proposed that we raise money from every Palestinian in the world,” said one of the interviewees, a young man who repairs ancient pottery. “Each would contribute $1 so that we could offer a reward to the person who found it and keep it in Gaza.”</p> \n<p>“I view it as a wounded man who needs urgent medical treatment,” added a female Gazan archaeologist. “What happened to it isn’t right, and it’s disrespectful of his dignity.”</p> \n<p>The film doesn’t identify the interviewees by name. Wadimoff said this was meant to preserve its allegorical character, but also to protect their identities.</p> \n<p>“The statue is a wonderful metaphor for the situation,” he said. “It’s so beautiful that it’s hard to find a place for it in Gaza.”</p> \n<p>Anyone familiar with statues of the Greek gods will realize that the Gazan Apollo differs from the norm. First, it’s made of bronze, which is relatively rare because over the course of history, most bronze statues have been melted down for use in making weapons. Second, unlike most of the known statues that remain, he still has a black stone in his right eye, which gives him a somewhat embarrassed look, very uncharacteristic of Hellenistic statues of the gods.</p> \n<p>“He looks ashamed,” Wadimoff said. “He wants to be proud, but he’s not allowed to be. He’s a prisoner of the situation.”</p> \n<p>There are questions about the statue’s authenticity. Gaza was an important city during the Hellenistic period, so it might well have had a temple to Apollo. But the statue doesn’t show any signs of having spent a long time underwater. It wasn’t covered with algae, coral and sediment, as is typical of statues that spent hundreds of years in the sea.</p> \n<p>The film raises various possibilities. Perhaps it came from Egypt and was smuggled into Gaza only recently, as so many other things are, via Hamas’ tunnels, and then hidden underwater to obscure its origins.</p> \n<p>Another possibility is that it’s a sophisticated forgery, perhaps made in Gaza by a local antiquities forger. In the film, a producer of and dealer in antiquities explains how one could create a small bronze statue that looks ancient in just a few hours. “But there isn’t enough bronze in Gaza for this one,” he said of the Apollo.</p> \n<p>The fisherman’s relatives, who pulled the statue out of the sea, broke off a piece of it to see if it was made of gold. They then tried to sell it on eBay for $500,000, but removed the offer two days later. After that, they negotiated with several potential buyers, but without success. Finally, Hamas raided their home and confiscated the statue.</p> \n<p>The people interviewed in the film spoke relatively freely about Hamas. One, a journalist, said the statue was apparently taken by the organization’s military wing, and it’s impossible to talk to them.</p> \n<p>Wadimoff stresses that the film’s goal isn’t to criticize Hamas. “If there is one main [thing] responsible for this situation, this is first, without any doubts, this merciless and inhumane blockade,” he said. “We tried to make the people remember what Gaza was and therefore what Gaza could be again … a crossroad of civilization in one of the most beautiful place in the world.”</p> \n<p>His optimism about Gaza’s future is echoed by some of the interviewees, including a major contractor, an antiquities collector and the owner of a cactus collection.</p> \n<p>“The abuse of Gaza will have to end someday, and then Gaza will be able to develop and look like you see it here,” the latter said. “What’s happening around us is temporary. The Arabic word for cactus is sabar, and the Arabic meaning of that word is patience. In Gaza, you need patience.”</p>",

A video shows he was shot in the back</p> \n<p>A senior officer in the Israel Defense Forces Central Command told Haaretz that Hamas has plotted more attacks than before, and cautioned that the organization's plans &quot;are more complex than lone-wolf attacks.&quot;</p> \n<p>However, he said, Hamas-sponsored attacks are easier to foil, due to the fact that they require the use of more extensive planning and network, whereas lone wolves &quot;are hard to get to before the attack.&quot;</p> \n<p>Senior officers said they are concerned over an increasingly successful trend of carrying out attacks and shifting activity from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank, particularly since the September attack in Gush Etzion, in which Ari Fuld was stabbed to death.</p> \n<p>One of reasons for this is a desire to bring some quiet to the Gaza Strip and give an emerging agreement between Israel and Hamas a chance to succeed.</p> \n<p>Defense officials added that the Palestinian Authority and its security forces are trying to fight attempts by Hamas to heat up the West Bank. Not unlike the IDF and Shin Bet security service, the PA arrests Hamas activists working to establish terror networks in the West Bank.</p> \n<p>In November alone there were four attacks and attempted attacks. On November 26, a car-ramming attack near the Gush Etzion Junction lightly wounded three soldiers. On November 22, shots were fired at the Jalameh crossing near Jenin. On November 7, shots were fired at a bus near the settlement of Beit El and November 5 saw an attempted stabbing at the Elias Junction.</p> \n<p>In some cases, perpetrators were shot and wounded or killed, while others were arrested. But in the most serious attack in recent months, a shooting at the Barkan industrial area near the settlement of Ariel, the perpetrator, Ashraf Walid Saliman Na'alwa, who killed two Israelis, evaded capture and has been at large for some 60 days now.</p> \n<p>&quot;A terrorist who manages to get away has a great effect on the grassroots,&quot; a senior Central Command officer said, adding that forces are spread over a wider area now as a result.</p> \n<p>Some of the incidents since the Barkan shooting were inspired by other attacks or carried out for revenge. Such is a stabbing of an IDF reservist in October at the entrance to Nablus, which was reportedly committed in revenge for the death of 47-year-old Aisha Mohammed Rabi, when stones were thrown at the car in which she was riding, near Tapuach junction in the northern West Bank.</p>",

        "text":["<p>After months of clashes between the Israel Defense Forces Ombudsman, Maj. Gen. (res.) Yitzhak Brik, and senior officers, the Knesset has finally begun discussing Brik’s allegations. And thanks to the live broadcast of Wednesday’s session, online and on the Knesset Channel, the public could also weigh the arguments of both sides.</p> \n<p>The one who finally picked up the gauntlet wasn’t the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, with which Brik has maintained an intensive correspondence recently, but the chairwoman of the State Control Committee, MK Shelly Yacimovich (Zionist Union).</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Israeli army watchdog paints gloomy picture of readiness for war&nbsp;| Analysis</p> \n<p>Yacimovich ran the meeting assertively, giving Brik the platform he needed to present his claims. But even there, some committee members (mainly, for some reason, opposition lawmakers), presumably confused about their job, behaved as if their main role was to discipline the 70-year-old war hero.</p> \n<p>And instead of confronting the officers who were dispatched to the session as representatives of the army with Brik’s charges, some of the MKs opted instead to give lengthy descriptions of their own military service and that of their relatives and declare their love for the army.</p> \n<p>Over the course of his dispute with the&nbsp;IDF, Brik has painted himself into a corner that he had trouble getting out of Wednesday. His refusal to cooperate with the steering committee set up by Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.Gadi Eisenkot, his demand for an independent inquiry and his gloomy prophecies about what will happen if war breaks out created significant resistance.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, it was hard to avoid noticing that a well-planned campaign was being waged against him, in which MKs — including retired generals — volunteered to attack Brik by any means possible in an effort to erode his public credibility. On the not-unreasonable assumption that at least some of Brik’s claims are correct, and that this would become clear if war were to break out, the assault on him may yet boomerang on its planners and executors.</p> \n<p>The General Staff claims that its dispute with Brik is substantive, not personal. But Yacimovich correctly noted that everything here is essentially personal. Eisenkot, in the waning days of his term, has been forced to defend his legacy against unexpected public criticism. And Brik has been deeply hurt by the IDF’s alienated attitude, given that until just a few months ago he had treated it with all due respect.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the allegations themselves deserve to be examined seriously. Even if Brik occasionally sounded Wednesday as if he were being dragged into making overly sweeping conclusions, much of what he said has merit — about the army’s flawed organizational culture, poor discipline, the fact that in some units, noncommissioned officers are afraid to tell their superiors the truth, and the difficulties in assimilating new weaponry into reserve units.</p> \n<p>Even though most of the headlines about Brik’s remarks related to his warning that the army was ill-prepared for war, his most important criticism may have been about the quality of the army’s manpower. On this issue, the army faces a real crisis (which Haaretz has reported on repeatedly in the past three years). Only recently has it begun digesting the severity of this crisis, thanks in part to Brik’s decision to make the facts public.</p> \n<p>To the army’s credit, it is now studying Brik’s allegations more thoroughly, even if belatedly. Brig. Gen. Uri Gordin, chief of the Ground Forces Command, responded to them in detail at Wednesday’s session.</p> \n<p>In addition, after a long hiatus, Brik is expected to meet Thursday with IDF comptroller, Brig. Gen. (res.) Ilan Harari, who is due to submit to Eisenkot his conclusions from an audit of several army divisions.</p> \n<p>A separate report by the Knesset subcommittee on the IDF’s preparedness, headed by MK Omer Bar-Lev (Zionist Union), is also being finalized. Its report is expected to refute some of Brik’s claims.</p> \n<p>And in about 10 days, Eisenkot will meet with the steering committee he appointed, chaired by reserve majors general Avi Mizrahi and Doron Almog, so they can submit their own recommendations to him. It’s a flood of reports, from which one most hope something useful will come.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, Brik’s radical and unprecedented moves succeeded in shaking up the army and forcing it to do some housecleaning, even if his style upset certain MKs and media advisors. When the dust settles, the IDF will owe the outgoing ombudsman a debt of gratitude.</p> \n<p>Toward the end of Wednesday’s session, Yacimovich summed up the issue succinctly: No one has ever died from a little criticism.</p>",

        "text":["<p>ANTAKYA, Turkey - “He is an Arab and the son of an Arab, but he doesn’t speak Arabic,” Sidika S&uuml;rer, 86, teases Maksut Askar, her 42-year-old grandson. The latter is the chef and proprietor of Neolokal, an Istanbul restaurant, and he’s considered to be a leading representative of contemporary Turkish cuisine internationally. Smiling apologetically, Askar caresses the hand of his grandmother in the living room of the family’s old house in Iskenderun, in southern Turkey, near the Syrian border. It was in this house, with its modest fa&ccedil;ade, surrounded by tangerine and lemon trees laden with fruit, that Askar spent his childhood.</p> \n<p>“I understand almost everything people say but I have a hard time conducting a conversation in Arabic,” he explains in English to the guests from Israel.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t until 1939 that Hatay, the province in which Askar was born, was annexed to Turkey. The issue of whether Hatay belonged to Syria or Turkey was a subject of dispute between the two countries until the turn of the 21st century. The Arab inhabitants of the province prefer to call it Antakya (Antioch), after the name of one of the four ancient capitals of Greater Syria, rather than by the Turkish name of Hatay (which derives from the Hittite Empire, which flourished in the region thousands of years ago). Askar, like many of his generation, speaks Turkish, even though Arabic was his ancestors’ native tongue and many still speak it in his hometown.</p> \n<p>Moin Halaby, chef of the Haifa restaurant Rola Levantine Kitchen, who was born in Israel to Druze parents, is speaking in Arabic with Askar’s grandmother. “The Turks are unjustly condescending to us Arabs,” the elderly woman says angrily when he asks her about the relations between the inhabitants of Turkish and Arab origins. But in the same breath she relates that one of her daughters is married to a Christian, and adds that in the ancient province – where adherents of different religions and various ethnic groups have coexisted for millennia – good relations exist between the neighbors. At least until it comes to issues related to cuisine.</p> \n<p>“The Turks learned how to make lahma bi-’ajin from us,” she declares, in answer to Halaby’s question about the source of the flat pastry topped with minced meat (lahmacun in Turkish), “but to this day we make it better than they do.”</p> \n<p>Askar and Halaby, who became friends recently when they met at Askar’s restaurant in Istanbul and went on a three-day trip to Antakya in November, share certain biographical elements. Both are of Syrian descent: Askar’s family goes back 18 generations in Antakya, Halaby’s arrived in Palestine in the 16th century from Aleppo, Syria. Both were born into Middle Eastern religious minorities – Askar is an Alawite; Halaby, a Druze – and chose to live outside their communities’ rigid and secretive laws. Both became chefs relatively late, after successful careers in other fields, and both opened their own restaurants, one in Istanbul and the other in Haifa, four years ago.</p> \n<p>The personal histories and the ongoing search for identity in the chaotic Middle East – for example, when Halaby, who served in the Israeli career army, says “we,” it’s hard to know whether he’s referring to an Israeli, Druze, Arab or Palestinian identity – are reflected in the menus of each restaurant. Both chefs are relentlessly occupied with investigating the past, but each in his own way. In Neolokal, which is located on the top floor of the SALT art gallery and cafe, and offers a breathtaking view of the Golden Horn, the dishes are traditional but prepared with personal and modern interpretation. By contrast Halaby, whose unpretentious restaurant is in Haifa’s downtown, tries to serve traditional dishes that are as close as possible to the original.</p> \n<p>The discussion about food, identity and family continues around the dinner table.</p> \n<p>“It’s disgraceful that you only told us yesterday that they are coming,” the grandmother scolds her wayward grandson. “If you’d told us on time, we could have prepared a real meal for the guests.”</p> \n<p>The “light” meal that Askar’s grandmother and one of his aunts threw together at short notice includes, among other dishes, watercress salad with pomegranate molasses; homemade salted yogurt; pickled mini eggplants stuffed with walnuts; zucchini stuffed with bulgur; pastries stuffed with wild spinach, and others topped with peppers, dry cheese and wild thyme; kebabs baked in tomato sauce, or fried and sprinkled with hot peppers, served with hot bread straight out of the tabun; fresh and conserved fruit; and a variety of cookies and sweet wafers.</p> \n<p>“When I’m in Istanbul I miss this food all the time,” Askar sighs, “and when I get home to my childhood haunts, I miss the feeling of being hungry.”</p> \n<p>For his part, Halaby is thrilled by the quality of the ingredients – the marvelous pomegranate molasses, the Saurani olive oil, the salted yogurt, the za’atar (wild hyssop) gathered in the hills behind the house – and by the pungent flavors.</p> \n<p>“It’s all so similar to my family’s kitchen and to my childhood, but yet so different,” he says. “Three years ago I went to Istanbul for the first time, and the first restaurant I ate in served Hatay food. Turkish cuisine isn’t monolithic. There’s the cuisine of the Black Sea region; the food that’s close, physically and metaphysically, to the Greek side; the cuisine of royalty that originated in Istanbul – and there’s the cuisine of southern Turkey, which is actually the typical kitchen of the Greater Syria region.</p> \n<p>“When I first tasted Hatay food,” he continues, “I felt a tremendous similarity to our flavors and techniques, and since then my interest has focused on this cuisine. It was important for me to come here, to taste the food in its place of origin and creation, and not only to experience it as it’s replicated in the capital city of the former empire.</p> \n<p>“Until 1939, the Antakya region was geographically and culturally Syrian, and it’s important in Arab history. Hanna Mina, one of the most important writers in Arab culture, was born in Iskenderun, and the first part of his autobiography is set there. From my point of view, Antakya is the northern end of the Levant and Haifa is at the southern end of that region, whose cuisine I try to represent faithfully in my restaurant.”</p> \n<p>Hummus history</p> \n<p>Sunday morning in Yagmuir, a restaurant in the village of D&ouml;ver on the outskirts of Antakya. The lay of the land, and the people it produced, powerfully evoke the Arab villages in northern Galilee. But the route that travelers from&nbsp;Israel are forced to traverse is an allegory of the follies of life in the Middle East: fly north from Tel Aviv 90 minutes, to Istanbul; then back southward, a two-hour flight, to Antakya, on the Turkey-Syria border. The lovely restaurant, a place of pilgrimage for the local inhabitants on the weekly day of rest, lies in the shade of a vast, ancient plane tree, adjacent to the center of the old village, the flour mill and a traditional men’s cafe.</p> \n<p>The restaurant’s long tables are crowded with families, children included, and everyone is enjoying the Antakya breakfast: sheep’s milk cheese roasted in pans of local clay; soft-boiled eggs on a salted yogurt base; menemen, the local version of the shakshouka egg-based dish; fresh cheese, and dried and spiced cheese (Surke payniri, the Antakyan equivalent of the Galilee shanklish); eggplant salad with olive oil, pomegranate molasses and mint; a salad of pickled olives and wild herbs; a selection of fruit jams and honey (including unforgettable mulberry molasses); and a variety of tabun and oven-baked pastries and breads.</p> \n<p>Silver-plated teapots, containing the strong, dark essence of Ceylon tea diluted with some hot water, grace the tables. “We’re still in the habit of calling it ‘smuggled tea,’” says Suheyl B&uuml;dak, who has researched Antakya cuisine and written books on gastronomy. “The reason is that this tea used to be smuggled in from Syria when the border was still closed. After Antakya was annexed to Turkey, the border was sealed and families were torn apart. Relations didn’t thaw until the 1990s. I managed to tour the length and breadth of Syria before the civil war broke out in 2012. Like many others, I traveled to Aleppo every two weeks. During the Ottoman era, Antakya and Gaziantep were subordinate to Aleppo; we are all brothers. We live in Turkey and we are Turkish citizens, but we are not Turks, we are Arabs. We lived in this territory during all the changes of rulers in the modern era – the French, the Syrians and finally the Turks.”</p> \n<p>B&uuml;dak, who is Askar’s mentor, began to study the history of Antakyan cuisine in 1987. His work methods include researching home-based cooking and a thorough, painstaking survey of written historical materials – not only books dealing directly with food – in order to extract scraps of information relating to the origins and development of local cuisine.</p> \n<p>“A friend asked me about where hummus originated, and I replied, completely naturally, ‘In Antakya,’” the elderly scholar relates. “The friend pressed me: ‘But can you prove it?’ Because I am an engineer by profession, and because research is empirical, I promised to give him an answer within a week. However, in the late 1980s there was still no literature dealing with the history of local food, and I failed in my task. A month later, we went to a restaurant and were served kibbe siniya, with ground meat inside – a traditional dish that few are familiar with today – and I realized that the knowledge from our mothers was disappearing.</p> \n<p>“I wrote an article in a local paper about different types of kibbe, and the responses were amazing,” he continues. “People started to call to offer me traditional culinary information and to treat me like an authority on the Antakyan kitchen. So I thought of compiling a book of traditional recipes from Antakya. The work on the book, which contains 300 recipes, took an entire decade. And by the way, it took me 20 years to find the answer to the question about the origins of hummus. Hummus already appears in a 13th-century Egyptian cookbook, but the recipe includes a mash of chickpeas, without tahini but with dried herbs and mint. They used to add sesame to the hummus, and gradually the sesame oil became tahini. In the 17th century you can find hummus recipes across the Ottoman Empire.”</p> \n<p>Hummus, one of the most explosive materials in the Middle East, will continue to be a bone of contention among the small self-styled delegation that has come to investigate the Antakyan kitchen. Emotional, Tower of Babel-like disputes are conducted in Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew and English, and each side cites historical and etymological arguments.</p> \n<p>“Something went wrong along the route between Haifa and Damascus and Antakya,” Halaby says gloomily, while visiting a few small hummus places in the heart of Antakya that serve thin hummus with tahini, laid out on a small dish and embellished with slices of pickles and tomatoes. (“Embellishment of the dish is a product of a magnificent tradition in the Abbasid dynasty,” says B&uuml;dak, singing the praises of the local hummus.)</p> \n<p>One of the most popular dishes at these local places is hummus served with a soft omelet that’s been fried in butter, and topped with sumac and parsley. (In Israel we’ve become accustomed to think that the addition of a hardboiled egg to hummus had its genesis somewhere in the encounter between Jews and Arabs, but it’s possible that it originates in a saliently local, Middle Eastern tradition.) This kind of hummus, which Askar remembers vividly from his childhood, was the inspiration for the hummus served in Neolokal – one of the dishes most closely identified with the Istanbul restaurant. The hummus puree – including tahini, lemon, olive oil and cumin – is cooked in the traditional fashion but evokes the mountainous realms of the chef’s childhood landscapes: The dish is garnished with colorful seasonings that symbolize Antakya’s location on the ancient spice routes between the Far East and Mesopotamia and the Near East. The pheasant egg served with it, which the diners are requested to mix with the hummus, is the modern equivalent of the omelet served on the hummus in Antakya’s restaurants.</p> \n<p>Bakeries in the city embody the way local traditions of the Greater Syria region have been preserved – as a result of circumstances of fate and geopolitical processes – in the modern world. “An old folk proverb says that the baker is never hungry,” B&uuml;dak says, “and in the old world everyone wanted to marry the miller’s daughter.”</p> \n<p>The skilled team at Yilmaz Kardesler Firini, one of the local bakeries, never pauses from its monotonous work next to the immense wood-burning oven. The bakery’s daily output includes flat breads, bagels and kulcha, a bread-like yeast pastry featuring a base of olive oil dough, seasoned with anise seeds (there’s nothing better to nibble on while drinking raki). Above all, as in old days, such baked items and wood-burning ovens are offered in the service of the community.</p> \n<p>A messenger boy on a bicycle departs every few minutes to bring bowls of puree intended as spreads to be roasted on top of the dough: mixtures of peppers and ground meat; peppers and onions; or peppers, tomatoes and dried cheese. The bakers prepare the pastries, which neighborhood residents season according to their tastes.</p> \n<p>Antakya and Iskenderun, the two largest cities in the region, have both preserved their village ambiance. Local folk continue to tend their fruit trees and pick wild herbs in the nearby hills. In the alleys of the lovely markets, jibni, the traditional cheese, produced by small domestic dairies, is on sale. (This variety of cheese, intended for kanafeh, has gained fame throughout Turkey, but its expiry date is typically three days after its manufacture.) The ancient markets here are also studded with makers of kadayif, the shredded dough used to make kanafeh, whereas in most places in the world it’s now industrially produced. Similarly, the small workshops that manufacture sweets, jams and molasses based on fruit, vegetables and nuts are also preserving regional traditions that have become almost extinct in the Land of Israel – once an integral part of Greater Syria.</p> \n<p>“He knows the gourds better than he knows his son and his family,” B&uuml;dak says with a smile about Bessam Bayasli, to whom the whole of Antakya flocks to buy the sugared pumpkin candies he produces.</p> \n<p>“I once studied architecture in Damascus, but that’s a story that belongs to a different life,” says the sad-eyed Bayasli, who devotes his day to cutting gourds, soaking them in lime and cooking them. The result is a confection that tastes like paradise; it has a hard outer covering and a sweet liquid inside. In Israel and in the territory of the Palestinian Authority, members of older generations continue to make similar sweets, but we’ve never tasted any that even come close to those made by the small-time artisans of Antakya.</p> \n<p>In the workshop of Berk and Buket Tatlicilik, a family home that morphed into a lovely little factory, traditional methods are used to preserve pumpkin, walnuts, mini-eggplants (“Only end-of-season unripe eggplants without seeds are used”), figs, strawberries, and bitter and bergamot oranges. The two regular employees at the workshop for jams and conserves – apart from the members of the Antakya family that opened the place 20 years ago, and are the fourth generation of local manufacturers of kanafeh and baklawa – are refugees from Aleppo who arrived here at the start of the civil war in Syria. (Almost a million Syrian refugees remain in Hatay Province, where it’s relatively easy for them to integrate and speak the local language.)</p> \n<p>“The food is nice,” they reply politely when Halaby asks them to compare local food with that of their childhood home, “but bad compared to the magnificent Aleppo kitchen.”</p> \n<p>There are those here who continue to think wistfully and longingly of Aleppo, the big city of the ancient province – whether their ancestors left 500 years ago and were forced to leave very recently and have witnessed its destruction.</p> \n<p>Morning repast</p> \n<p>Tuesday morning at the Antakya Kahvalti restaurant in the old city of Antakya. The narrow alleys, paved with stones and mule-passage friendly, lead to a lovely inner courtyard shaded by loquat and citrus tree. This was the birthplace of Metin Tansal, one of the city’s best-known restaurateurs and proprietor of the popularly priced Sultan Sofrasi restaurant. In his childhood home, which became a restaurant specializing in breakfast, waiters dressed in frock coats serve the best-known, traditional morning repast in Antakya. Why Israel has developed a name for itself because of its breakfast is beyond us. This even more abundant and varied Antakya meal – with its egg dishes, cheeses, pastries and salads – is enhanced by eggs served with wild pistachio buds; slices of dried cheese (shanklish) fried in butter and evoking the taste of sujuk sausage; olives cured from rare species that have been revived in this Turkish-Syrian region; and peels of conserved bitter oranges stuffed with walnuts and kaymak (rich cream made from buffalo milk).</p> \n<p>“The Antakya kitchen lives the past but exists in the present,” B&uuml;dak observes. “Thirteen of the 15 known civilizations of the ancient world lived in Antakya and left their imprint on the local kitchen.”</p> \n<p>He is echoed by journalist and food researcher Aylin &Ouml;ney Tan. “Antakya gained fame thanks to its famous mosaic works,” she notes, adding, “For me, Antakya cuisine is a mosaic of flavors that reflect different cultures that lived in the region across history. Three cities in this area – Aleppo, Gaziantep and Antakya – are counted among the most important culinary centers of the Middle East, and the three constitute a gastronomic league in their own right.”</p> \n<p>Ever the incorrigible optimist, B&uuml;dak wonders innocently why Antakya can’t be a cultural center that forges a connection between Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the other countries the Middle East. “The language of cuisine is international,” he says. “Why shouldn’t it become the language of peace?”</p> \n<p>The guests from Israel shrink uncomfortably and continue to check the frequent news reports from home, where Israelis and Palestinians are continuing to hammer one another lethally in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>In 2015, UNESCO, the United Nations scientific and educational agency, declared the nearby city of Gaziantep a gastronomic World Heritage Site. Two years later, Antakya joined that prestigious list, also because of its gastronomic heritage. But the beautiful city is finding it difficult to translate the international recognition into a major culinary attraction. Since 2012, when the civil war in Syria broke out, Antakya – which has been called “the Tuscany of the Middle East” – has been almost empty of tourists.</p>",

        "text":["<p>What is the craziest thing about the Watergate scandal, over 45 years on? Is it that, seeking dirt on his opponents, U.S. President Richard Nixon approved a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in June 1972, even though he was already 19 points clear of his nearest rival?</p> \n<p>Is it that for over two years between 1971 and 1973 Nixon made secret recordings of his White House conversations – which turned out to be the petard upon which he was hoist – and whose existence only came to light quite by chance at a Senate Watergate Committee hearing?</p> \n<p>Is it that Nixon’s discredited playbook – waging war on the press, political rivals and the judiciary by any means necessary – is now back in vogue?</p> \n<p>Is it that 1972 remains the last time a group of “plumbers” happily agreed to a call-out in the wee hours of a Saturday morning?</p> \n<p>Or is it that one of the darkest times in America’s modern history can be seen today as a moment from which to draw inspiration, a time when the checks and balances worked, when bipartisanship overcame party rivalries and the madman in the White House was ousted?</p> \n<p>That’s certainly one of the messages optimists can draw from Charles Ferguson’s six-part documentary “Watergate – Or: How We Learned to Stop an Out of Control President.” All four hours recently aired on the History Channel to surprisingly little fanfare, yet this deserves a wide audience – especially among those currently despairing in the age of Trump. See, things were much worse in the early 1970s, when they didn’t even have “Friends” on Netflix to distract from life’s miseries.</p> \n<p>“Watergate” successfully navigates between being too simplistic or too wonky, and at its best grips like a particularly labyrinthine thriller. The show’s subtitle is not its only attempt at reinforcing similarities between the early ’70s and the current era. But the documentary is, generally, subtler than both that subtitle and the final words seen on screen – the oft-cited quote by Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Even 45 might consider that a little too on the nose.</p> \n<p>Luckily, Ferguson has unearthed a treasure trove of footage from the Watergate era and landed numerous present-day interviews with many who were there at the time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of these interviewees were on the right side of history, with Nixon aide-turned-conservative commentator Pat Buchanan the lonely voice fighting in Tricky Dick’s corner.</p> \n<p>The only real misstep here is the decision to stage reenactments of Nixon’s clandestine White House events, using actors to portray the dark dealings among all the president’s men (the dialogue is taken verbatim from Nixon’s secret tapes).</p> \n<p>It’s always a dilemma, deciding how to recreate real-life events in a documentary (my vote would have been for a rap musical, but apparently Lin-Manuel Miranda now owns the copyright). Even so, surely they could have found someone who looked or sounded remotely like Nixon here? British actor Douglas Hodge doesn’t get close – not even in the same zip code. Compounding the problem is another miscast British actor, Elliot Levey, as Henry Kissinger. (Given Christian Bale’s upcoming performance as Dick Cheney in the film “Vice,” anyone would think American actors don’t want to be associated with dodgy right-wing politicians.)</p> \n<p>The bad news is that these reenactments are used extensively in the first few episodes. The good news is that they feature less frequently as the congressional investigations become the main focus. Oddly, the only time a reenactment truly works is at the very beginning, when we get one hell of a cold open as Nixon tells his White House cronies: “Please get me the names of the Jews. Big Jewish contributors to the Democrats. Can we please investigate some of these cocksuckers!”</p> \n<p>To be honest (as Nixon himself would never say), most of my knowledge of the Watergate scandal comes from the 1976 film “All the President’s Men” – Alan J. Pakula’s retelling of how Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the story of the century thanks to thousands of phone calls, shoe-leather journalism and an embittered friend in a high place (FBI Deputy Director Mark Felt – aka Deep Throat).</p> \n<p>That side of the story is well covered here, with both journalists entertainingly recounting their stories – including the threat from former Attorney General John Mitchell that “when this campaign is over, we’re going to do a little story on you two boys.”</p> \n<p>While Woodward and Bernstein’s roles are well-known, Ferguson’s documentary is at its best when it spotlights Watergate’s lesser-known heroes. These include politicians like young Democratic Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, who warned of America being on “the long road to tyranny” as she sat on the House Judiciary Committee investigating the affair; Rep. Peter Rodino, the Democratic head of the committee, described here as “the hero of Watergate” for his efforts to ensure the investigation was a bipartisan effort; and Lowell Weicker, who was the first Republican senator to openly call for Nixon’s resignation. There were many more heroes as well, including jurists, reporters and prosecutors.</p> \n<p>The documentary’s most jaw-dropping footage comes from the televised Senate Watergate Committee hearings in 1973, which at its peak saw some 80 million Americans tuning in to watch the likes of former White House Special Counsel John Dean (whose 245-page testimony was described as containing a bombshell in every paragraph) and White House Chief of Staff H.R. “Bob” Haldeman provide insight or obfuscation in dealing with the famous question posed by Senator Howard Baker: “What did the president know, and when did he know it?”</p> \n<p>Some of these scenes are still genuinely shocking – like when Haldeman is asked why he wrote the words “Good” and “Great” on an October 1971 White House memo, warning of potential violence and “extremely obscene signs” being displayed during a presidential visit to Charlotte, North Carolina. Others are outright funny, like Robert Odle, office manager of the Campaign to Reelect the President – the source of the funding for Nixon’s nefarious deeds – recounting how Watergate co-conspirator G. Gordon Liddy, carrying a foot-high pile of paperwork, “asked me where the paper shredder was. He later came out and said, ‘How do you make it work?’”</p> \n<p>There are many moments here where you question whether you’re watching something from 1973 or a remake from 2018, especially when it comes to the scornful presidential treatment of the media. CBS’ then-White House correspondent, Dan Rather, is shown as the Jim Acosta of his day – unafraid to ask hard questions, and then being abused by the president for asking them.</p> \n<p>There is also the chilling moment when, after a copy of Nixon’s infamous “enemies list” is presented at a Senate hearing, CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr is shown live on air reading from that list of 200-plus names and finding his own name there with the accompanying text: “A real media enemy.”</p> \n<p>Then there’s the portrayal of a president who firmly believes l’Etat, c’est moi and dominates the news cycle to a ridiculous degree. “Every day he does something of interest. It’s sort of like a rat going around – you keep trying to kill it, and it gets away” could easily have been said about President Donald Trump, but these words were spoken by Gore Vidal back in 1973 about Nixon.</p> \n<p>This fascinating history lesson also prompts one disturbing question: Would Nixon have suffered the same fate in the age of Fox News, with a team of right-wing hawks backing his protestations about witch hunts and conspiracies, and labeling every fact they don’t like “fake news”?</p> \n<p>Still, at least the documentary highlights one difference between the two presidents. Nixon is constantly asking his henchmen “Has his income tax been checked yet?” in a bid to smear his rivals. At least we know Trump will never voluntarily bring up the subject of tax returns.</p>",

Bethlehem store owners also said they were benefiting from a surge of visitors to Israel in its 70th anniversary year.</p> \n<p>Filing past a 16-meter Christmas tree in Manger Square, lines of pilgrims squeeze through the narrow sandstone entrance to Bethlehem’s Church of the Nativity, a centuries-old basilica whose grotto, Christians believe, is where Jesus was born.</p> \n<p>“We have never received this number of tourists coming to Palestine,” said Palestinian Minister of Tourism Rula Ma’ayah.</p> \n<p>“Especially in a city like Bethlehem, tourism creates waves throughout the economy.”</p> \n<p>Hotel occupancy rates in Bethlehem are expected to exceed 95% by the end of December, the city’s hoteliers’ association said.</p> \n<p>“We are fully booked during the Christmas season,” said Wissam Salsa, Manager of the Walled Off Hotel, a quirky Bethlehem guesthouse designed by the British street artist Banksy.</p> \n<p>“But of course, our hotel is fully occupied all of the time,” Salsa added. “It is in the West Bank.”</p> \n<p>The hotel overlooks a towering concrete section of the barrier that Israel has built through the occupied West Bank, cutting off Bethlehem from Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>Israel says the barrier stops suicide bombings, while Palestinians complain that it loops around Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank, where they want to set up a state.</p> \n<p>The boom in Bethlehem tourism comes as Israel enjoys and record year of tourism. Israel’s Tourism Ministry is projecting more than four million visitors will arrive in 2018. Some 3.8 million tourists visited Israel in the first 11 months of the year, 14% more than in the corresponding period last year..</p> \n<p>Some American pilgrims in Bethlehem seemed to regard their visit as a continuation of a tour through Israel, rather than a trip to a Palestinian city.</p> \n<p>“Coming to Israel has always been on my bucket list,” said Robyn Jackson, 36, a travel adviser from Phoenix, Arizona, who was shopping for souvenirs in a Bethlehem street leading to Manger Square. “Being in Bethlehem and all the places where Jesus walked is amazing.”</p> \n<p>For one group of American travellers, Israel’s anniversary — together with U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to open an embassy there — was certainly a factor.</p> \n<p>“I think excitement has been stirred because of the embassy move,” said Keith Jiles, 55, a pastor from Atlanta, Georgia.</p> \n<p>“People had been afraid in the past to come. But excitement has built. And you’re gonna see more tourism because of it,” he said.</p>",

He said the returns demonstrate that “the war is over and the country’s restoration is proceeding at full pace.”</p> \n<p>Russia, which has waged a military campaign in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has pushed for the repatriation of refugees.

Various types of excavators were digging away as dozens of soldiers and officers worked around them.</p> \n<p>A soldier in a protected observation post operates a camera that records the events unfolding below, inside the tunnel. That device aided in setting off an explosion when Hezbollah operatives tried to dismantle the camera underground, and was the device that supplied the comic image of the day: A video shared by the army shows two men from the organization fleeing the tunnel after the explosion.</p> \n<p>The Israeli journalists who were brought on Wednesday to the field, now a closed military zone, were barred from photographing the scene. That didn’t affect the television crews that gathered on the Lebanese side of the border and recorded every movement on the Israeli side.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Tunnel demolition operation: Hezbollah is in no hurry to battle Israel | Analysis&nbsp;■&nbsp;From Gaza to Israeli elections: Seven insights into operation against Hezbollah tunnels</p> \n<p>Lebanon’s leaders are downplaying the Israeli operation. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri of the Amal movement said Wednesday that Israel is free to dig to its heart’s content, as long as it remains on its wide of the border. But it seems that everyone in south Lebanon recognizes the significance of the new development.</p> \n<p>A brief tour of the terminus of the first tunnel, with officers from the Northern Command, sheds light on Hezbollah’s presumed plan. According to intelligence assessments, the organization did not have a concrete date for launching a war on Israel. The tunnels were part of Hezbollah’s preparations for the future, meant to facilitate a surprise attack, similar to the strategy employed by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; The battle over the timing of Israel's operation against Hezbollah tunnels | Analysis</p> \n<p>In an article published in the Israel Defense Forces journal Maarachot in June 2014, Military Intelligence officers described the changes made to Hezbollah’s plans. When the organization’s leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, first threatened to “conquer the Galilee,” it was an idle threat. Hezbollah and its Iranian masters know they cannot vanquish the IDF or drive it out of significant parts of the Galilee.</p> \n<p>That’s not the plan. The plan is to launch a war with a surprise attack, in which commando forces will cross the border and take control of remote communities or military positions for a limited period of time while targeting the reinforcements the army will surely deploy. The plan has since become more sophisticated, incorporating lessons learned by Hamas in Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip as well as the relatively complex offensive operations carried out by Hezbollah militants in the Syrian civil war.</p> \n<p>The tunnels were supposed to allow companies from Hezbollah’s Radwan special forces unit enter Israel undetected. The tunnel that was uncovered outside Metula is shorter and shallower than the ones the IDF has found in the south, but even so it could have brought dozens of militants into Israel quickly. From there, they were to spread out, take key positions and begin employing snipers and anti-tank missiles against the IDF.</p> \n<p>Immediately after the shock troops invaded Israeli territory using the tunnels, as their assault was detected, more forces would breach the border fence. Metula is a desirable target to Hezbollah, accessible only by a single, relatively steep road.</p> \n<p>At the same time,&nbsp; according to assessments, additional companies of militants were to use other tunnels to enter Israel before spreading out and occupying strategic points along the ridges south of the border, in an effort to stop Israeli troops from advancing northward.</p> \n<p>The IDF Northern Command, police intelligence and the army Engineering Corps are prepared for an operation to detect additional tunnels that is expected to continue for weeks and could go on for months.</p> \n<p>The military and political officials are signaling, at least now, total confidence in the quality of the intelligence they possess about the tunnels. The impression is that the searches are focused on specific areas that will allow for the discovery of more tunnels. The military is unfazed by criticism claiming that it was possible to make a more aggressive move that would constitute a stronger deterrent.</p> \n<p>The goal was to remove the threat, but also to contain Hezbollah along the border and prevent a slide into violence. It's likely that the organization would have responded with force to Israel crossing the border to conduct operations on the other side. Such a move could have developed into several days of fighting against Hezbollah, if not an all-out war in the north.</p> \n<p>In the eyes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as those of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, it was critical to carry out the operation and to do so now. The right operational and technological conditions developed over the past few months, and according to assessments, Hezbollah might have been able to get the tunnels ready for action within a few weeks, if necessary.</p> \n<p>In the weeks to come, Israel plans to leverage the discovery of the tunnels for diplomatic gains, as it did with the tunnels dug under the Gaza border by Hamas.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu will turn the site outside Metula into a “model tunnel,” inviting diplomats from around the world to observe Hezbollah’s offensive intentions in person. The exposure of the tunnels is a stage in a protracted Israel war against Iran and Hezbollah. All the signs suggest that all the combatants plan to continue to clash next year, too.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Education Minister Naftali Bennett slammed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday after reports emerged that Netanyahu asked the Walla News website to publish reports stating that the religious minister's wife worked as a pastry chef in a non-kosher restaurant.</p> \n<p>The Israel Television News Company&nbsp;reported that Netanyahu had asked longtime friend&nbsp;Shaul Elovitch, former owner of Walla, to report the false claims about Gilat Bennett.&nbsp;Elovitch is suspected of taking bribes from Netanyahu in the corruption scandal dubbed &quot;Case 4000.&quot;</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Analysis:&nbsp;Unable to charm the media, Netanyahu sought to control it</p> \n<p>&quot;I feel sorry for you, Mr. Netanyahu,&quot; Bennett tweeted, &quot;You took the trouble to personally call the owner of Walla to hurt my wife, and this is a despicable and cowardly act.&quot;</p> \n<p>Bennett added, &quot;I married Gilat, a wonderful woman from a secular and ethical home, and together we founded a wonderful Zionist religious home. My family is the pride of my life, do not apologize to me, I am not interested, apologize to my wife.&quot;</p> \n<p>Likud responded to the accusations, saying: &quot;There is no limit to Bennett's hypocrisy, he is the one who has to apologize. Many journalists know that from the moment he left Netanyahu's office, Bennett never stopped speaking ill of Sara Netanyahu and slandering her at every opportunity.&quot;</p> \n<p>The report about Netanyahu's request was published by associates of Elovitch, the former controlling shareholder of Bezeq and Walla News. &quot;There is a news site that criticizes the prime minister every day,&quot; the associates said. &quot;What's wrong with the owners trying to moderate the criticism a bit against a man who is his friend and his regulator?&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>To prove that Elovitch only followed Netanyahu's requests when he agreed with their content, people close to him cited the example of the report against Gilat Bennett, which Elovitch reportedly refused to publish.&nbsp;&quot;Elovitch helped Netanyahu only when he thought he was right, and they did not agree to publish such a thing.&quot;</p> \n<p>Last month, Bennett demanded that the position of defense minister be given to him after Avigdor Lieberman resigned.&nbsp;After Netanyahu decided to take the job for himself, it was thought that Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked would resign. The two however decided to stay in the government.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli-American actress Natalie Portman slammed Israel's nation-state law as &quot;racist&quot; and a &quot;mistake,&quot; in an&nbsp;interview with BBC’s Arabic language channel on Sunday.</p> \n<p>In the interview, which marked the release of her new film, &quot;Vox Lux,&quot; Portman explained that the law is a political decision that impacts the lives of many people, adding that she hopes to be part of the change that can improve Israel's relationship with its neighbors. Portman also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>Israel's controversial nation-state law, which the Knesset passed in July, states that “Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people,” which has exclusive right to self-determination in the country. It defines Hebrew as the country’s sole official language, designating Arabic as a language with special status, although adding that Arabic's status would not be harmed in practice.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt; Israel's contentious nation-state law: Everything you need to know</p> \n<p>Critics of the nation-state legislation, which, as a Basic Law, bears constitutional weight, object in part to the fact that it does not include a provision stating that all Israeli citizens are equal under the law.</p> \n<p>This isn't the first time the Hollywood actress criticized Israel. Portman, who was born in Israel but moved to the United States with her family when she was young, sparked a scandal when she announced in April that she would not come to Israel to accept the&nbsp;Genesis Prize&nbsp;(a $1 million award given annually to Jewish people who have attained recognition and excellence in their fields). “Recent events in Israel have been extremely distressing to her and she does not feel comfortable participating in any public events in Israel,” her representative said at the time.</p> \n<p>Portman has said that she does not support the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. In 2009, Portman&nbsp;joined other Hollywood stars in protesting calls for a boycott against the Toronto International Film Festival for its staging of a Tel Aviv-themed event. She also directed and starred in a Hebrew-language adaptation of Israeli novelist Amos Oz’s memoir, “A Tale of Love and Darkness.”</p> \n<p>&quot;I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it. Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation.&quot; Portman added that she treasures &quot;Israeli friends and family, Israeli food, books, art, cinema and dance.&quot;</p> \n<p>She went on to say that Israel &quot;was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for&nbsp;refugees from the Holocaust. But the mistreatment of those suffering from&nbsp;today's atrocities&nbsp;is simply not in line with my Jewish values. Because I care about Israel, I must stand up against violence, corruption, inequality and abuse of power.&quot;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Correction (December 20, 2018): An earlier version of this article misattributed the original source of Portman's interview. The interview was given to BBC’s Arabic language channel and then published in Al-Quds Al-Arabi.</p>",

        "text":["<p>Israeli troops shot a Palestinian man near the West Bank city of Ramallah on Wednesday as part of an ongoing manhunt for the assailants beind Sunday's drive-by shooting&nbsp;near an Israeli settlement. The man later died of his wounds at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.</p> \n<p>The development came hours after&nbsp;the death of the baby&nbsp;who was delivered Sunday after his mother was&nbsp;seriously wounded in the attack.&nbsp;The baby's&nbsp;mother,&nbsp;Shira Ish-Ran, who was seven months pregnant when she was shot and seriously wounded, is in stable condition and remains hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the Shaare Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem. Her husband, Amichai, who was also wounded in the attack, is in stable condition.</p> \n<p>Troops from Yamam, a police counter-terrorism unit, set out for the Palestinian village of Surda on Wednesday evening. Acting on intelligence leads, troops pulled their vehicle next to a parked cab where the suspect was sitting. According to police, the suspect was hiding in a mourners' tent, and was assisted by the people in it. The troops were attacked upon entering the tent, and responded with flash grenades and live gunfire. The suspect was critically wounded during the exchange.</p> \n<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;Opinion:&nbsp;I have a serious problem with leftists who are okay with the murder of settlers</p> \n<p>Clashes erupted in several spots in Ramallah as Israeli army and Border Police forces searched for additional suspects. Israeli forces surrounded a house near the Palestinian Authority's headquarters, which is close to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' home.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Palestinian reports identified the man killed as Saleh Omar Barghouti, 29, from the village of Kobar. Saleh is the son of Omar Barghouti, a senior Hamas member in the West Bank who is known as a veteran prisoner. Barghouti&nbsp;has been arrested and jailed multiple times by Israel, spending 28 years (non-consecutively) in Israeli prisons. His elder son, Assam, was held in an Israeli prison for eleven years for committing security offenses; among them was a plan to abduct Israeli soldiers.</p> \n<p>A resident of the village of Kobar who knows the family told Haaretz that Saleh was not known to be affiliated with Hamas or influenced by his father, and at this stage it is unclear if he was involved in Sunday's terror attack, which took place near the Israeli settlement of Ofra.</p> \n<p>Hamas responded to Thursday morning's events, including the killing of the assailant in the Barkan industrial area attack two months prior, saying: &quot;The fire of resistence in the West Bank will not die until the occupation is lifted. The death of the two soldiers proves that the option of the Palestinian people is defiance. The West Bank will continue to support the forces of resistance and the blood of Neloah and Barghouti has not been spilled in vain. Hamas and the other resistance factions will continuie to support activity to avenge their death.&quot;</p> \n<p>Islamic Jihad released a similar statement, calling on Palestinians to escalate confrontations.</p> \n<p>Omar Barghouti told Palestinian media that a cab hit by Israeli fire belongs to his son. He also said that his son was taken by special forces and that he does not know what happened to him next.</p> \n<p>A man in his twenties sustained moderate wounds in the attack, while four other people were lightly wounded — two boys and two girls aged 16.</p>",
